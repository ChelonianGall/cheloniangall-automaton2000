 Zenoscave: thank you!
 ZarthaxX: np pewman
 Zenoscave: how's your bot?
 ZarthaxX: last timeouting like a beast
 Zenoscave: ouch
 ZarthaxX: having so many days makes me lazy
 eulerscheZahl: good morning
 Zenoscave: morning
 eulerscheZahl: did you really want that link from ZarthaxX or the replays/reproduce/&lt;id&gt; one?
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i should add some linking between them
 Zenoscave: The reproduce one is what I was looking for
 ZarthaxX: i erased that link part
 struct: Hello
 Zenoscave: Hi struct
 Nixerrr: Hell√≥
 kovi: joregg
 Nixerrr: :blush:
 Quidome: I have this strange behaviour where after a sonar input which is N I don't get the opponent order but I lose
 Quidome: I mean sonar result
 Quidome: Anyone else having problems with the server?
 struct: Are you sure you are reading all inputs?
 Quidome: checking again...
 Quidome: yep it looks correct
 Quidome: It already worked before :P
 Quidome: I get the sonar result, after that i wait for the opponent order and the game ends, me loosing
 struct: python?
 Quidome: yep
 struct: ok
 struct: so you need to add this
 struct: print("Hello world!", flush=True)
 struct: to prints
 Quidome: for std as well as for stderr?
 struct: not sure if needed
 struct: for stderr
 Quidome: doesnt hurt I suppose,  i will add it, thnxs
 struct: it works?
 Quidome: it is different, lost my seed&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: stop it chandanagrawal23
 Quidome: Got past the input issue, thnxs!
 struct: coc euler?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i guess invite options are sorted by the leaderboard, didn't check
 struct: Doenst seem like it, but it shows online players first
 Nicky1812: I HAVE SEEN A GHOSTTT
 Nicky1812: kidding xd
 tobk: how come there are 3600 registered but only 1200 in the leaderboard, in a contest that was announced the same day it started? did 2/3 take one look at the game and say "nah, not gonna submit"?
 Nicky1812: what does "join' in python, guys&#160;?
 Nicky1812: what does it mean?
 eulerscheZahl: join a string
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. join(' | ', [1,2,3]) gives: '1 | 2 | 3'
 eulerscheZahl: tobk 97% of those who registered also opened the game in the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have stats on who changed the code or clicked the play button
 tobk: who knows, still three weeks to go, but kind of weird anyway
 eulerscheZahl: it is. that high difference between registered and playing is normalbut usually a contest is announced weeks or even months before
 Nicky1812: oh ok
 Nicky1812: how to input multi variables on 1 line?
 Insta-x: input()
 Insta-x: its like getline in cpp
 Insta-x: if you want to seperate the variables, input().split()
 Insta-x: it will split the inputs into a list
 Nicky1812: hmm ok 
 Insta-x: it depends on what seperates the variables tho. if its normal whitespace, split() will do the job
 tobk: Nicky1812 actually that part should be pre-generated for all puzzles
 Insta-x: if not then split(&lt;something that seperates the variables&gt;)
 Nicky1812: wait example a,b=input().split()
 Nicky1812: input 2 3
 Nicky1812: so a=2 b=3?
 Insta-x: a,b = [i for i in input().splt()
 Insta-x: or a,b = map(int,input().split()0
 Insta-x: if you want to turn them into int then a,b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
 Nicky1812: hmm i ll try
 Insta-x: some typo there sry
 Nicky1812: :v 
 kgautron: guys, when did "ocean of code" contest start&#160;? i thought the next contest would be in may and did not get notified for this one&#160;:/
 MSmits: kgautron it started 9 days ago, 21 to go. Plenty of time, a normal contest is 10 days here
 MSmits: also this is not the planned contest
 MSmits: it is an extra contest because of the corona crisis. People were notified by mail
 Quidome: is there a way to see if I am getting a time-out or other system constraint?
 kgautron: oh ok cool then. Thank you man.
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: Quidome you can measure time depending on your language
 MSmits: every language has ways
 MSmits: but usually timeouts mean you have a bug
 MSmits: writing some memory you're not supposed to, division by zero etc.
 MSmits: or bad output
 Quidome: I understand, but my games al end after 70 moves or so with an unclear reason
 MSmits: then it's debugging time. Which language do you use?
 Quidome: So I was wandering is there more inforamtion&#160;:)
 Quidome: python
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: what does it say when you timeout
 Quidome: I don't know IF it timeouts, it just stops making a move
 MSmits: personally I would try to measure your turn time every time and then error-output that. If you are near to timing out, you will probably notice in earlier turns
 MSmits: if those are 40 ms, 45 ms etc.
 Quidome: OK , I will try that, thnxs
 MSmits: However, python might also not be the best language for this contest
 Quidome: good for prototyping, getting a grip on the problem 
 MSmits: pretty sure you will be able to get silver or even gold with it, but higher leagues will require heavy tracking code
 MSmits: sure thats true Quidome
 Skril: Quidome, you can see if you timed out in the replay's bottom bar
 eulerscheZahl: but not if it's a real timeout or a crash
 Skril: oh ok
 Quidome: If python crashes you got more info
 Quidome: but not on the timeout so it seems...
 MSmits: yeah i imagine the crashing output is much much better than c++ 
 Quidome: First add some timing stuff, thnxs  guys
 MSmits: i spent hours yesterday trying to find a bug where I was writing outside the board on one of my bitboards
 MSmits: c++ will just let you do it until it leads to a catastrophic error
 eulerscheZahl: that's what you get for your bitboards
 MSmits: true, but thats what you get with C++ in many ways
 MSmits: if I had bitboarded this in C# i would have known immediately
 Csipcsirip: you can use debug macros
 MSmits: I'm not very knowledgable about those, do you have some examples or a link?
 Insta-x: hello again MSmits
 Insta-x: lol
 MSmits: hi Insta-x
 Insta-x: ive changed my propic :v
 Csipcsirip: u have to write it yourself. you have to make bitsetting a macro. and add boundary checks with #ifdef _DEBUG
 MSmits: oh ok, good 
 Csipcsirip: but I'd recommend using std::bitset
 MSmits: ahh ok, that would be a lot of extra code though
 MSmits: isn't bitset a lot slower?
 Csipcsirip: and I everything else is working in your code you can still change it to manual bit operation
 MSmits: also, I can quite cheaply shift an entire uint16_t[15] map 1 cell to the right or left
 MSmits: or when shifting up and down, just copy the rows
 MSmits: can bitset do that/
 MSmits:&#160;?
 Csipcsirip: I'm don't do stuff like that,but:
 Csipcsirip: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/bitset/operator_ltltgtgt">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/bitset/operator_ltltgtgt</a>
 Csipcsirip: *I
 MSmits: thanks
 Csipcsirip: np. btw I don't know how much slower is it than plain bit toggling, but I wont timeout until like 60k states
 Csipcsirip: state = {position, hp, path, mineposition}
 MSmits: I think i timeout at 10-30k states or so, but 1 state can be many of your states
 Skril: on flood fill, bitset seems 20% slower than crafted bit toggling
 MSmits: I start the game with 1 state
 MSmits: you probably start the game with 225 - islandcount states
 MSmits: I keep the origin as a variable instead of picking a fixed origin for each state
 Csipcsirip: yes I just bruteforce valid states based on inputs from enemy every round
 MSmits: I do too
 MSmits: but differently
 MSmits: if an opponent would never silence, I would always have only 1 state
 MSmits: only silence makes more states
 MSmits: note, i am not tracking mines yet
 MSmits: they might also split states, when they explode
 Csipcsirip: ahh I see. I started with something like that, but it got too complicated, and replaced it to simple states
 MSmits: it is pretty complicated, but I like it
 Quidome: yep, got a time-out :P, that was really difficult to find out...
 Quidome: Assumed the server would report me, well as it goes with assumptions
 Quidome: they never work out :D
 MSmits: the server only knows that you didn't output anything
 MSmits: it has no idea that you would output something if given more time
 MSmits: that's why it can never tell you if you are having a pure timeout or a  crashing bug
 eulerscheZahl: well, the server knows if the program crashed (see error message in the IDE)
 eulerscheZahl: the referee doesn't know if a crash happened
 MSmits: yeah, that's true, but that doesnt come from the referee ...
 MSmits: right
 Quidome: yeah but the server decides to stop serving because of time
 Quidome: could have reported that
 MSmits: it does
 MSmits: because every time your program doesnt output it's because of time
 MSmits: and your program didn't output...
 Quidome: hm...
 Quidome: a message would be very helpfull 
 MSmits: if you dont see output it's always a timeout, is what I mean
 MSmits: yes but it gives a message
 Quidome: not to me, it simply stops worling
 MSmits: player x did not output in time or something, doesnt it say that somewhere eulerscheZahl	?
 Quidome: but no problem, I am having fun anyway
 eulerscheZahl: no message on timeout
 eulerscheZahl: but a line where it crashed when it does
 eulerscheZahl: so no message = timeout
 MSmits: I thought i sometimes got one, does that depend on the game?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe some referees add that message
 MSmits: ah ok yes that must be it
 eulerscheZahl: but they can't know if crash or timeout either
 MSmits: yeah
 Quidome: supose this is the moment to switch to C or C++ :nerd:
 eulerscheZahl: or Rust
 MSmits: Quidome if you know java or C#, that might be more coder-friendly
 MSmits: unless you are good with C++
 MSmits: I'm not, but I got 30 days so...
 eulerscheZahl: he used C++ for oware i think
 Quidome: Maybe try something new, Rust, is that fun?
 eulerscheZahl: ask dbdr
 MSmits: dbdr thinks it is
 Quidome: never done that, does it compare to anything?
 MSmits: it's as fast as c++
 dbdr: I think it fun, yes&#160;:)
 MSmits: but doesnt use optimizations in the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: but release mode on submit
 dbdr: similar than C and C++ in being able to do low level operations
 eulerscheZahl: so it's settled, you will use Rust
 dbdr: more moder type system
 dbdr: so the compiler helps you more to find bugs
 dbdr: it does take some time to learn, for sure
 MSmits: I imagine it doesnt suffer from all the backward compatibility issues and weird stuff in C++
 dbdr: right MSmits, one of the main advantages
 MSmits: do you need to do forward declaration in rust?
 dbdr: no
 eulerscheZahl: yay
 MSmits: see there you go, rust is superior to c++ already
 dbdr: rust has a proper module system
 MSmits: it's the stupidest thing about c++
 dbdr: and super easy to import 3rd party libraries, like npm for JS
 dbdr: not useful for bots obviously, but for tools it is very
 dbdr: I do have a few 1st party libraries, code I reuse between bots, that I can import like that
 nnminh171298: hey how come there is no higher league than silver in Ocean of code?
 dbdr: stuff for parsing input, for instance
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: there will be \
 dbdr: I want to do more progressively
 MSmits: gold opening 3rd of april
 eulerscheZahl: and legend on 10th
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl, are you dropping rank because of performance, or strategy? 
 MSmits: you were top 10 before I think
 MSmits: and illedan i thought was up there too, did he change something?
 MSmits: or maybe i just did too many contests with you guys and i get my leaderboards mixed up
 Insta-x: the rank system id based on the score right?
 MSmits: the rating yes
 MSmits: true skill rating
 eulerscheZahl: my best ranks about 30 but i think that was a lucky submit
 Insta-x: if you win, you get a point, elif you lose you lose a point
 Insta-x: true skill rating?
 MSmits: oh ok, sorry, I got things mixed up then. I fully expect you to be top 3 in the first few days
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i was top3 on the first weekend
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: but didn't work much on the bot after
 eulerscheZahl: it's a full month, no need to hurry
 MSmits: I took a break of about 4 days
 Insta-x: oo ok
 eulerscheZahl: to play UTTT?
 MSmits: partially. also doing some work
 eulerscheZahl: how's your teaching going?
 MSmits: working ok, I am writing a socrative quiz now. Turns out it's better than google forms. You can use it like a test, with scores and feedback
 MSmits: just to check on the students, see if they are keeping up with homework
 MSmits: if they don;t i can let their mentor call their parents and stuff
 eulerscheZahl: did that happen yet?
 MSmits: not yet, but I havent been doing this for very long. I did call a few parents to make sure the students signed up to the google classroom. But most did that voluntarily
 eulerscheZahl: and still learning something new in your it security class?
 MSmits: some new things yes. I did some reflection ddos attack simulation. Also some more network flow measurements to identify intrusions
 MSmits: 2 more weeks until it is done. It's not really my favorite class
 MSmits: at the end of april my AI class starts
 MSmits: so I can do what I like and receive study credits :P
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds more like your cup of tea
 MSmits: yeah, I wasn't supposed to do that class, but my media and user interaction class got cancelled due to too few signups
 MSmits: so this is a replacement class
 MSmits: hurray for that
 eulerscheZahl: hope you won't learn too much there and use that on CG to crush us
 MSmits: highly doubt i will learn much, but I will for sure enjoy it
 MSmits: my fellow classmates no very little I think
 MSmits: know
 MSmits: so unless they are awesome differentiators, they will have to settle on a low level 
 MSmits: from what I hear, it is bfs, dfs, minimax, mcts, ga etc.
 struct: chat didnt scroll
 MSmits: Ga would be sort of half-new
 MSmits: some neural networks
 MSmits: but you dont get to write one yourself
 MSmits: just theory
 MSmits: afaik
 struct: So I read you only have 1 state
 MSmits: yes
 AntiSquid: mchl is staying strong i see
 MSmits: struct except on silence
 MSmits: then I suddenly have 13 states
 MSmits: or so
 struct: What about mines?
 MSmits: didnt get that far yet
 MSmits: it should only split on explosions
 MSmits: if you have several possible candidates for the explosion
 struct: but you dont know the direciton he puts mine
 MSmits: I would not store the mine in the location it was placed
 MSmits: i would store the mine in the location *from* which it was placed
 MSmits: like minesweeper
 MSmits: you get a number for the possible neighbor count
 struct: So you flag the cell where boat is
 MSmits: yes
 struct: and not neighbors
 struct: Interesting
 MSmits: I think that is the way to go
 AntiSquid: playing minesweeper 
 MSmits: when a mine explodes that has no neighbors with count &gt; 0, it is a faulty state
 MSmits: yeah thats basically it AntiSquid
 MSmits: but you can only eliminate states on explosion
 struct: Your approach seems interesting
 MSmits: and explosions may also split states
 struct: Has good things and bad things imo
 MSmits: the bad thing is mostly the complexity
 struct: yes
 MSmits: coding complexity
 MSmits: thats why i spent so much time to get my silence tracking working
 MSmits: and probably why i will spend more time on my mine tracker
 struct: So 1 state
 MSmits: also pruning states with mines is going to be a nightmare
 MSmits: yes 1 state at the start
 MSmits: with origin as a variable
 struct: so it can be in any cell
 MSmits: it's basically a floating path
 struct: except islands
 MSmits: the path has no fixed origjn
 MSmits: origin
 MSmits: i shift it as needed to, keep it within the bitboard
 MSmits: this floating path thing will give you headaches though :P
 MSmits: also, trying to combine it with some kind of damage map to also filter based on explosions is even more painful
 MSmits: since the state doesnt tell you where the sub is
 MSmits: only where it can be, based on the variable origin
 struct: hmm
 struct: too much for my brain
 MSmits: yes, but I tend to think on these things for days before coding them. It's too much for me as well, were someone to explain it to me right now 
 MSmits: this is why i suck in short contest, I need thinky-time
 struct: But I appreciate you sharing this tuff
 struct: stuff*
 MSmits: yeah np, I probably shouldn't :P
 struct: During the contest no
 struct: if you want to be competitive
 struct: imo
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: well there's a tradeoff 
 MSmits: sometimes when i share, someone gives me ideas in return
 MSmits: or it functions as rubber ducking
 MSmits: and I get new ideas myself
 MSmits: but yeah, i should probably do this in PM&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: finally something remotely useful
 MSmits: what?
 struct: where=
 MSmits: how?
 eulerscheZahl: my bot
 struct: ¬¥top 20 nice
 MSmits: any specifics, or do you just want to exclaim eureka&#160;? :P
 eulerscheZahl: eureka
 MSmits: grats&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: like that greek guy with the bath tube
 eulerscheZahl: archimedes
 MSmits: what corner of the internet did google push you into eulerscheZahl?
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: yeah thats right
 MSmits: you mean bath tub, I was figuring you were watching some weird youtubes
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 AntiSquid: defeated fake jesus:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/443396676">https://www.codingame.com/replay/443396676</a>
 MSmits: colouring book sub
 YannT: MSmits: I just did detection by trigger as we mentioned yesterday (using path, so no "point in time" notion), I've failed to find a replay where it prunes even one possibility&#160;:(
 MSmits: or "how to make someone track you easily"
 MSmits: ah yes, you do need the point in time notion I think
 MSmits: paths go everywhere
 MSmits: but even then I don't know how succesful it will be
 MSmits: because when it is succesful, he likely just blew you up :P
 YannT: hey what do you know, it does remove a possibility in some instances
 YannT: it's just rare to get value out of it apparently
 MSmits: cool&#160;:)
 emh: MSmits do you do (branchless?) BFS using bitmaps? how? bit shifts to get all neighbours of all nodes? I'm thinking of doing that. not sure I need the performance, but just bit fiddling for fun hehe
 emh: might need to intersperse rows with one bit so I can mask out shifts that cross rows
 MSmits: on my profile I have a bfs playground
 AntiSquid: you can use bits with the branched approach too 
 MSmits: but I dont really do bfs in this contest, I floodfill for 1 thing though
 MSmits: maybe I will bfs later
 AntiSquid: another storm for UK wow .
 MSmits: means more people stay inside = good
 Errichto: any CG employee here? is it ok if I stream this game on Twitch?
 MSmits: less idiots on the beach
 emh: MSmits ohh I already read that BFS playground. didn't see it was yours hehe
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: Errichto there were already some streams so i don't think it's a problem
 AntiSquid: Errichto there are dozens of streamers already, so definitely (not an employee)
 eulerscheZahl: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/577567902">https://www.twitch.tv/videos/577567902</a>
 AntiSquid: maybe link your stream here, like the others did <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discordapp.com/channels/466965651135922206/472807181163429890">https://discordapp.com/channels/466965651135922206/472807181163429890</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the video i linked was even streamed on the official CG twitch channel
 YannT: I seriously wrote something like 
 YannT: this.value - 1 &gt;= ...
 YannT: -_-
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see what's wrong without a bigger context YannT
 YannT: well this would maybe be clearer: 
 YannT: this.value &gt; ...
 YannT: :p
 YannT: (it's integers)
 eulerscheZahl: wow, illedan even used a camera on the stream :o
 Csipcsirip: so he is an e-boy now officially
 AntiSquid: e-boy? lol
 AntiSquid: MSmits you were wrong, it's windy outside but my neighbour's kids are running around
 Errichto: ok, thanks everybody, I will do some stream
 Tunga: Cheers
 Tunga: Ranking refresh everyday&#160;?
 MSmits: AntiSquid I didn't say zero idiots. I said less :P
 MSmits: unless you performed a reliable idiot-count, i stand by my comment
 MSmits: also, if you're  goint to go outside and count all of them, make sure you add +1 :P
 AntiSquid: sure, have someone call police "there's a guy counting children outside" MSmits
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, I asked my friends last time. And they said having a camera makes it easier to follow what is being said..
 wlesavo: yeah, having an image of a person  kinda helps to concentrate, i dont know that works, but it is
 wlesavo: dont know how
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have an opinion on that, as i don't watch these streams. whatever you think fits best&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: title clearly shows it was icebox streaming /s
 MSmits: it doesnt help me concentrate, but my hearing is less good and it helps with lip-reading
 mohsenmnassri: hi
 eulerscheZahl: isn't that a problem as a teacher?
 MSmits: i have hearing aids so it's ok
 AntiSquid: it's easier to ignore noisy kids&#160;?
 MSmits: when i take them off yes
 MSmits: it's great at home, small noises don't  wake you up
 AntiSquid: i use ear plugs
 MSmits: that helps
 struct: same
 AntiSquid: i can hear every tiny drop in the kitchen or bathroom Q_Q
 MSmits: yeah that's annoying
 MSmits: or clocks
 AntiSquid: or someone's breathing ...
 MSmits: don't you just hate it when they do that
 AntiSquid: lol
 struct: only when I want to sleep
 AhmedReda1: hello there&#160;:)
 struct: breathing I can stand
 struct: but snorting
 struct: cant sleep
 MSmits: snoring I guess
 MSmits: snorting would be worse, but i doubt people would keep up with it for long
 AntiSquid: "there"&#160;? are you laughing at us being in lockdown AhmedReda1&#160;?
 AhmedReda1: first day here
 AhmedReda1: i dont know what is going on
 AhmedReda1: HAHAHHAA
 MSmits: thats a yes AntiSquid :P
 AntiSquid: which planet are you from?
 AhmedReda1: mars
 AntiSquid: ya MSmits he even capsed his laughter
 AhmedReda1: im from egypt &lt;3
 MSmits: I saw
 kovi: yay, some improvement
 struct: I just  looked
 SujalAI: someone teach me ocean of code please
 struct: mchl hasnt submited in a while
 kovi: true
 struct: I think he hasnt submited since bronze
 struct: the date it shows for his bot is when silver opened
 struct: his bot is around 5 days old
 AntiSquid: hiding the best for legend :o
 struct: I just hide from legend
 nnminh171298: sometimes I feel like I enjoy building the classes more than the algorithm..
 Tunga: I recommend noise cancelling headphones over concentration problems with noise. I hate my noisy office and I bought one of the expensive one. It worked like charm. I, now, can control my thought like a flow 
 AntiSquid: hope he is ok and returns, i remember last time when some new guy got 1st place and then only dropped because he never returned to the site
 rosejam: mic test
 rosejam: 123
 nnminh171298: heard ya
 AntiSquid: can barely hear you rosejam can you speak louder?
 rosejam: lol
 AntiSquid: serious, try yelling wanna see how loud you can get
 rosejam: CAN ANY BODY HEAR ME??!!!!!
 rosejam: GUESS NO ONE'S HERE!'
 trexplex: I can hear you
 Tunga: Ayyyy ayyy captain
 rosejam: thats the maximum voice i could make. AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: the signal is bad 
 rosejam: omg
 rosejam: :grimacing:
 AntiSquid: have you turned your mic to max&#160;?
 yfprojects: maybe your volume is turned down, AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: ah you're right, try again now
 rosejam: yes that what i wanted to say
 rosejam: nono everyone is hearing me well now including you
 rosejam: :thumbsup:
 JBM: eulerscheZahl: please don't make me create yet another github account&#160;:'(
 AntiSquid: rosejam you can use the discord voice chat:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discordapp.com/channels/466965651135922206/690566608891936769">https://discordapp.com/channels/466965651135922206/690566608891936769</a>
 AntiSquid: it's codingame discord
 struct: lets be honest
 struct: nobody uses it
 AntiSquid: rosejam might use it, struct
 Tunga: We hear you on discord 
 rosejam: i would like to but i'm on sth else
 rosejam: maybe later
 eulerscheZahl: JBM oh you edited your changes to link to the final html now
 JBM: but don't use that
 JBM: I'm giving you actual commits, dangit
 eulerscheZahl: yes, just saw that too
 ThienPhu: idol
 eulerscheZahl: "This is a two-player game based on the board game Captain Sonar"actually it's up to 8 players, 2 teams
 JBM: yes
 JBM: but this one is 2
 JBM: that's actually why I mentioned it
 AntiSquid: that would have been something, 4v4 and maybe communication between team bots
 eulerscheZahl: so, there's your branch <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/tree/jbm-patches">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/tree/jbm-patches</a>
 YannT: "Execute pincer maneuver #3"
 JBM: you rock
 YannT: *surfaces and shoots self*
 eulerscheZahl: not reallyi still have to get staff to actually use your changes
 eulerscheZahl: sounds much more English now
 JBM: yeah, I stripped quite a few of what I've come to calle "the german comma"&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: "if you are in doubt, leave the comma out"
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i did it again
 eulerscheZahl: then i call this the french space . leaving a space before fullstop .
 JBM: we don't do that
 JBM: we would for&#160;:&#160;;&#160;!&#160;? though
 eulerscheZahl: at least for&#160;: i see it often
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 JBM: but not . or ,
 JBM: it's supposed to be a thin non-breaking space
 eulerscheZahl: i see. i notice that in the puzzle section sometimesand "exemple"
 JBM: but those are hard enough to come by, so best typo fallback is no space; alternate fallback is regular nbsp
 JBM: haha exemple, yeah, pretty frequent
 JBM: any any other of those old french words that are still in english with a diverged meaning
 JBM: eventually
 JBM: mmm can't think of the others just now
 eulerscheZahl: i have a colleague at work who always says "become" instead of "get"
 YannT: you know what I would love
 eulerscheZahl: a pizza?
 accorp: a beer!
 YannT: I tool that would replay the last N battles from your history with a new bot version and tell you if you've improved the outcomes
 YannT: it'd be kinda like integration testing
 accorp: I would love to be able to put labels on the submits in the history tab...
 accorp: and a beer
 eulerscheZahl: CG enhancer accorpgoogle it
 eulerscheZahl: at least for your first point, you can't download beer yet, only play vindinium
 accorp: thanks!
 AntiSquid: 3D printed beer
 JBM: just brew it
 JBM: a fine confining activity
 HelmiAkermi: guys how to reactivate autocompletet in IDE
 eulerscheZahl: try ctrl + comma
 eulerscheZahl: also: left side settings -&gt; make sure it's classic (or emacs/vim if you changed it before)
 eulerscheZahl: if this doesn't do the trick, search here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts">https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts</a>
 JBM: that emacs mode is a complete joke, TBH
 YannT: back to top10 :tada:
 YannT: (barely)
 HelmiAkermi: thanks , it was the browser i refreshed the page and it works now 
 JBM: gg
 HelmiAkermi: sometimes you need those suggestions for non usual used functions
 eulerscheZahl: and other times you need an offline editor
 HelmiAkermi: agreed
 AntiSquid: the autocomplete can fail after a while, offline IDE is kinda necessary
 eulerscheZahl: offline IDE has debugging capabilities
 struct: they could update their ide
 struct: but it wouldnt change anything
 struct: I would still use VS
 Tunga:  Is there a possibility where one of the cases in ANEO puzzle wrong&#160;? 
 Tunga: ANOE Sponserd Puzzle? 
 wlesavo: nop
 eulerscheZahl: some users struggled with rounding errors. you can use the puzzle with only using integers, on floats
 Tunga: I think original makers use calculators while doing it and after they roll the number but in the end rolling numbers is wrong  
 Tunga: I am working in automotive industry and you never roll tiny digits 
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl i thought i had rounding errors, just couldnt solve it properly, stoped trying and went to other puzzles. after couple of month i  realized ive read the statement wrong
 Tunga: You calculate over it, if you cast it to int the case it true but if you use float the case seems wrong 
 yfprojects: When does the next league open?
 AntiSquid: in IDE at the top click on league
 tarriel: did they just make the bosses easier? I was sitting at about pos 30 in wood 1, and am now pos 1 in bronz with no new submission?
 eulerscheZahl: no, on friday already
 tarriel: this just happened now? but I didn't re submit since yesterday...
 eulerscheZahl: then you got lucky and someone pushed you up
 eulerscheZahl: or the boss down, i don't know if there was a full resubmit or just a replacement of the code
 tarriel: all the way to the top of bronze&#160;:)
 tarriel: just promoted to silver with the same code...
 tarriel: it's pretty bad code, I don't even shoot yet...
 tarriel: I guess I can go to sleep now I have passed two leagues
 MSmits: hehe so some people promote to silver shooting everything in sight and some dont shoot at all&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: you can come back Friday when gold opens tarriel
 tarriel: I don't think I can be that lucky 
 tarriel: I wish in the top league, they could set the default opponent to a player, like 50 positions about my rank...
 eulerscheZahl: you can still replace it by yourself
 tarriel: I know, I, just think it would make a better boss most of the time.
 eulerscheZahl: CGs point of view (when i wrote a strong default AI for kutulu): default AI should be weak to motivate players fighting each other and not only default AI
 CodingCaptain: They could just do random from your postition + - 20 postions; 
 tarriel:&#160;:) I think that is what I'm saying, just set a player stronger than you as default, but not totally out of your league (some random would be good also.
 eulerscheZahl: CodingCaptain are you and alt account of someone? your profile pic feels a little trolling :D
 CodingCaptain: Blank pic feels like trolling?
 eulerscheZahl: chat color pic
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid is that you?
 CodingCaptain: No, its totally blank
 Tunga: Yea, it is really weird
 eulerscheZahl: you were from the UK 5min ago
 struct: also
 struct: another thing
 struct: the name
 eulerscheZahl: now from Latvia
 struct: reference to contest
 eulerscheZahl: wait, not UKVirgin Islands, British
 CodingCaptain: Just let me code
 eulerscheZahl: ok, sorry for bothering you
 Tunga: Can I submit a contest with 1 wrong case? 
 HelmiAkermi: java&#160;: loop in array or in list&#160;?which is the faster?
 eulerscheZahl: submit a contest Tunga? you want to suggest a new game to become the next contest?
 CodingCaptain: About my pic: if u choose spot that goes out of your picked photo bounds(when picking profile pic) it makes it look that way
 AntiSquid: lol all that panic buying just to throw food away<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/YlVE8z4/0_THP_CHP_280320SLUG_533JPG.jpg">https://imgur.com/a/YlVE8z4/0_THP_CHP_280320SLUG_533JPG.jpg</a>

 Tunga: My mistake. I solved a Sponsored puzzle but 1 case is wrong. Can I submit like this?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: but you won't get 100%
 AntiSquid: probably
 Tunga: After submit, I cant resolve sponsored problem? 
 Tunga: Again? 
 struct: you can
 CodingCaptain: U can
 CodingCaptain: U can sumbit any amount of times u want
 kovi: oops
 Tunga: Ohh okay, thanks to all of you! 
 struct: nice kovi
 kovi: thx
 AntiSquid: :o
 AntiSquid: 2 points lead
 eulerscheZahl: impressive lead, why "oops"?
 eulerscheZahl: oops because you forgot to hide? :D
 AntiSquid: accidentally over-wrecked opponent
 kovi: this is a lucky one for sure
 kovi: hard to hide considering that i only use cg ide/submit so far
 eulerscheZahl: i use offline play vs myself to filter the most stupid ideas faster
 eulerscheZahl: apart from that submit is the real test
 AntiSquid: i wish i had 2.30 points worth of luck
 eulerscheZahl: but only on league opening
 pb4: "but not . or ,it's supposed to be a thin non-breaking space"
 pb4: I never knew
 eulerscheZahl: that's some really old chat you refer to
 pb4: dat lead kovi :neutral_face:
 kovi: will not last long
 eulerscheZahl: then take a screenshot
 accorp: and do a selfie with the leaderboard - you know, for the ladies
 accorp: well that was an embarrassing 6-0 loss for me&#160;:)
 dGrayCoder: How do you beat boss in bot Programming contest? Do you actually beat boss in every match against it or do you have more overall wins in the league?
 struct: you need to be above the boss
 struct: so you also need to beat other players
 struct: You dont really need 100% win rate vs the boss
 struct: Sometimes even &lt; 50% is enough  if you beat the other players
 eulerscheZahl: and you have to submit and wait till the progress reaches 100%
 dGrayCoder: I have been stuck with rank 2 in my league (with only boss above me) for a whole day. What does that mean?
 eulerscheZahl: you have to get better
 AntiSquid: it means the boss hates you
 dGrayCoder: better than what? Do I need even more wins against other players? 
 AntiSquid: beat boss
 AntiSquid: which league are you in?
 dGrayCoder: Is there any way to check you all battles against just one opponent ( boss in this case)
 dGrayCoder: I'm stuck in gold for now
 eulerscheZahl: which game?
 dGrayCoder: coders strike back
 AntiSquid: you're playing the wrong game dGrayCoder
 AntiSquid: you need to click here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code</a>
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-coders-strike-back/dGrayCoder">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-coders-strike-back/dGrayCoder</a>
 dGrayCoder: O:
 eulerscheZahl: but AntiSquid is right, play the contest
 AntiSquid: and best if you don't get promoted, you just cause lag for everyone else when you drop the boss
 dGrayCoder: I am quite new in this. Why is it the wrong game? 
 eulerscheZahl: you can play coders strike back at any time
 AntiSquid: well contest has a limited duration, so it's best to play that before it ends
 CodingCaptain: Contest is limited time
 eulerscheZahl: the contest ends in 3 weeks
 dGrayCoder: Oh I did not know that.
 CodingCaptain: Often contests are for 10 days, this one is longer, but still its time limited
 eulerscheZahl: and lots of activity (players submitting all the time, chat is about that game mostly)
 dGrayCoder: ty for information
 dGrayCoder: @eulerscheZahl  thanks for that link
 eulerscheZahl: kovi please stop, your last submit completely destroyed me
 YannT: a surprising lot of my losses actually come down to "you went into the huge minefield for no good reason"
 YannT: well there's a reason, it's where there's a lot of non-visited tiles, but maybe that's not a good enough reason to go into the stack of mines...
 eulerscheZahl: i still have to find the right condition to just surface and turn around in that case
 YannT: same
 eulerscheZahl: and do something about <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443460668">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443460668</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i hope that problem will fix itself in gold
 YannT: also maybe not path into where there's probably a lot of mines when you've got other options...
 YannT: I actually just submited a fix for that
 eulerscheZahl: i try to avoid mines already
 YannT: "if chain silencing noob, limit path tracking because you're gonna win anyway"
 icecream17: what!? why did i blow up my own mine?
 accorp: what do you mean, you're supposed to do that at some point..?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: well yes with trigger
 icecream17: at myself, -2 lives
 AntiSquid: the game heavily rewards silence, so you're noob if you don't use it @_@
 MSmits: however, if you *only* use silence, you will probably lose
 MSmits: the opponent only needs 1 lucky hit
 AntiSquid: well if you have a crap bot you lose, but silence is always better than no silence
 icecream17: the only thing i don't use is sonar. i wonder how useful it is
 eulerscheZahl: you can easily beat me with silence :P
 MSmits: I disagree, I could beat illedan by chain torpedo-ing everything in sight
 MSmits: chain torpedo beats chain silence
 icecream17: where are you at in the contest (everyone)?
 AntiSquid: ya a lot of top bots time out from silence spam
 eulerscheZahl: silver
 AntiSquid: (tested it)
 MSmits: I can't be timed out that way
 MSmits: but not a top bot yet :P
 AntiSquid: ya was talking about top bots
 MSmits: my current submit may get into top 100 though, 55% and rank 133 
 k4ng0u: no need to silence just mine everywhere :D <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443470505">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443470505</a>
 MSmits: still completely ignoring mines, but now it charges torpedos and silence and uses  silence when available. And only torpedo's when expected damage &gt; 0.7 
 icecream17: if people don't torpedo -&gt; mine and silence -&gt; else if they spam torpedo -&gt; silence on 8th move and then torpedo
 icecream17: thing is my mines explode in 2 moves....
 ZarthaxX: MSmits 0.7 means possible spots / 9 = 0.7&#160;? 
 MSmits: mine is next for me. I like the idea of mine laying. Especially since I often know where the opponent is but I am not close
 AntiSquid: maybe i should make some tiny improvements to my bot instead of waiting till friday? :thinking:
 MSmits: ZarthaxX total damage on possible opponent spots (center = 2x) divided by total number o fpossible opponent spots
 ZarthaxX: ok
 ZarthaxX: did you stole that from blaster? :P
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: I was looking for the trademark emote
 MSmits: when i said that
 MSmits: or is there a copyright one
 blasterpoard: well, I guess it is time to use SILENCE in chat from now on
 kovi: may or may not be correct
 MSmits: bleh, it is exactly what i would have come up on my own, I was already adding up damage on map :P
 kovi: possible positions and probability of being there
 MSmits: it's common sense really
 AntiSquid: ya certainly everyone thought about it and was already implementing it
 blasterpoard: I already deleted that btw
 MSmits: but always appreciate when you share blasterpoard&#160;:)
 MSmits: why, it's not a bad idea
 blasterpoard: it is
 MSmits: when you can do damage... do damage
 kovi: for first its ok, there are better ones
 AntiSquid: it's not accurate enough i guess would be the issue
 MSmits: well up the treshold then
 MSmits: if 0.7 is too low
 blasterpoard: actually... it might depends on what the opponent's hp is and on his silence cooldown
 <b>**blasterpoard SILENCEs</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: hmm it might weakly depend on that, but not strongly
 MSmits: if right before silence, its useful, if right after silence, it's also useful
 MSmits: *provided* it is over the threshold
 AntiSquid: 2 weeks from now smits adjusting his 0.7 param
 MSmits: haha
 MSmits: probably
 MSmits: I hope I don't have too many params
 eulerscheZahl: my toppedo hamage was 0.5, let's see if 0.7 is any better
 MSmits: dont type while you're eating
 eulerscheZahl: arena: 48   OceanOfCode: 73   draw: 1
 eulerscheZahl: seems to be
 eulerscheZahl: the draw is a crash btw
 MSmits: whats that scoring?
 MSmits: arena 48?
 eulerscheZahl: wins
 MSmits: what is the 73?
 eulerscheZahl: wins of my test bot with 0.7
 MSmits: ohh I get it
 MSmits: does your bot drop mines?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: do all topbots drop mines?
 eulerscheZahl: should i use 0.7 there as well?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, mines are mandatory
 MSmits: should have a separate param
 MSmits: mines dont reveal you as easily
 MSmits: probably it should be lower
 blasterpoard: actually, detonating your mines should also depend on how much info it gives to the opponent
 eulerscheZahl: and if i miss the chance to trigger, they become useless
 MSmits: exactly
 blasterpoard: maybe the number of times you silenced since you dropped it, if you want a simple heuristic
 MSmits: i thought you were gonna keep quiet
 blasterpoard: I will in gold
 MSmits: here you go again, giving good advice
 eulerscheZahl: first i have to use mine explosions for tracking my opponent
 blasterpoard: for now, I'm TRIGGERing
 MSmits: aha
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl, I assume you mean his explosions, not yours
 MSmits: because your explosions are just as easy to track as your torpedo info
 eulerscheZahl: i mean using his explosion to tell where he has been before
 MSmits: yeah, that's what I am working on also. I think it might be the hardest part
 eulerscheZahl: 3 timeouts in my first 3 matches, great start
 MSmits: well, when you include pruning that is
 eulerscheZahl: * in first 10
 MSmits: do you store mines where they can possibly have dropped or where they were dropped *from*
 icecream17: so many comments
 eulerscheZahl: from where
 MSmits: ah ok, probably best
 kovi: i like blaster's thought on "silver" and and "gold" ideas&#160;:)
 blasterpoard: for now, I'm working on things I'm sure will be in my final bot
 blasterpoard: so that's silver ideas for me atm
 MSmits: blasterpoard, your bot that got top 50 just by shooting and silencing, did that also avoid mines?
 blasterpoard: MSmits no
 MSmits: hmm weird. My bot got to 136
 MSmits: maybe because my start spot is still completely random
 blasterpoard: it tracks the mines, and uses explosions to track the opponent, but ignores them otherwise
 blasterpoard: mine is too
 MSmits: ohh, it tracks the mines
 blasterpoard: just a fixed seed
 MSmits: yes that helps
 blasterpoard: do you want me to submit without mine tracking?
 blasterpoard: MSmits k, I'm submitting now, this bot ignores enemy triggers, otherwise is the same as the last one
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: gonna go walk my dog and check your result later
 MSmits: might be I also need to allow for more states. I prune at 1000 states. Might be too soon
 kovi: yeah
 MSmits: remember my states contain a lot more information though. I start the game with 1 state as opposed to 225
 MSmits: so it's more like somewhere between 10k and 100k of your states
 AntiSquid: fix it
 kovi: sounds reasonable then
 MSmits: yeah, but if i got the calculation time, i should stretch it a bit
 MSmits: i never even timed it
 Valdemar: Hi! Did anyone implement proper path reducing after silence? I try to discard paths that intersects with visited tiles, but it seems to be harder than i thought.Problem is that after first silence there is multiple possible paths and each silence get the things worse  
 Valdemar: So the question is: this is really that complex or I miss the proper solution?
 kovi: it is not trivial, but doable. probably top50 silver all has it
 Valdemar: How many maximum states do you get in game when tracking all possible positions?
 Valdemar: Or there is some kind of smart prunning in top player strategies
 CodingCaptain: Valdemar to make it simple (but not that good)  u can clear moves history after opponent silence
 blasterpoard: Valdemar it depends a lot on what the opponents are doing
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen above 5k and then timed out
 blasterpoard: if an opponent does nothing but silence, I've seen my bot reach 200k states
 CodingCaptain: It reduces possible positions quite a lot after enemy silence, but not optimal
 Valdemar: blasterpoard wow, thats huge amount. So prunning is must have at some stage then
 blasterpoard: Valdemar yes, it is
 blasterpoard: but most of the games, it stays under 1000
 blasterpoard: because people don't really care about when they use silence
 Valdemar: ok, ty blasterpoardstore all states sounds reasonable then. It should works often
 blasterpoard: Valdemar my current bot writes a message when it prunes, you can see when states go above some arbitrary number
 blasterpoard: if it interests you
 icecream17: There's only 225 squares on the grid how does it reach 200k?
 Valdemar: i'll take a lookmy bot ignore tail and shooting suffers very much because of that
 blasterpoard: icecream17 different visited squares
 Valdemar: you can get to same tiles from different paths icecream17
 icecream17: oh
 blasterpoard: changes you options for the future a lot
 Valdemar: that's silence stuff
 Valdemar: yep, you cannot just ignore that if you want to create robust enemy tracker
 Valdemar: blasterpoard absence of such messages means that there is no prunning and bot store all possible states?
 Illedan: Anyone knows if it is faster to do operations on 32 bit or 64 bit numbers on the CG servers? Might not be needed, just wondering.
 Valdemar: my bot do silence by cooldown and i don't observe prunnings
 JBM: they're a 64-bit arch
 JBM: as to which is faster, I'm afraid there's no definite answer without more context
 Illedan: Just working on my bitboard for OOC. And wonder if it is faster to represent each row as 32 or 64 bit
 JBM: yeah i wouldn't want to say any thing too definitive in this regard
 Illedan: aiit
 Illedan: Guess I have to benchmark in the game xD
 JBM: just start with the more natural fit
 emh: Illedan I'm doing each row as 16 bit. so 16 x 16 = 4x64 bit. I'm using avx2
 Illedan: Is it faster to use 4x64 bit than 15 x 16 bit :thinking:I guess you have to do a lot more operations and such. And test the hell out of it
 emh: trying to avoid intrinsics as much as possible though. using gcc auto-vectorization mostly
 Illedan: Do you need all the performance you are getting :P
 Illedan:&#160;?
 emh: no I don't think so. was using C# without optimization before
 emh: and that worked fine
 emh: just doing it for fun
 Illedan: JBM, thx for the feedback on the forum btw.I'll let players write X Y EXTRATo let them get more inputs. To not break the game&#160;:)
 Illedan: ic
 emh: but this way can do action search trees, maybe will need perf then
 JBM: what's x y extra?
 Illedan: When you place yourself
 JBM: oh, for the self-view?
 Illedan: You have to send an extra command:ex: 4 12 EXTRAThis enables extra inputs for that players
 JBM: yeah, that could work
 Illedan: So that I can send extra inputs every  round
 Illedan: and not break
 JBM: as long as it's the default in the stub
 Illedan: You have to fix your input reading ofc
 Illedan: if you want the extra
 JBM: of course
 Illedan: And wont break others
 Illedan: I'll create a contribution with a stub for that case if anyone needs
 JBM: well, there's no rush
 Illedan: I know
 Illedan: Will be done during next week
 Illedan: Gotta fix my own but before I start to get bored
 JBM: heh
 JBM: so, while you're here
 JBM: could you confirm the questions i had during the early bronze to bronze stream?
 JBM: so i can make a more interesting statement update proposal
 Illedan: What was the question=
 Illedan:&#160;?
 JBM: which actions are illegal (as in, referees stops the player), which ones are merely invalid (as in, referees ignores it, possibly resulting in SURFACE)
 JBM: lemme get my list
 blasterpoard: Valdemar yes, if it doesn't print out anything, it means it didn't have to prune at all
 JBM: well it's kind of always the same
 JBM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a02ac44-9954-4395-927e-1ca125a52496">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a02ac44-9954-4395-927e-1ca125a52496</a>
 JBM: my assumption for all of them would be "if target ((x,y) or (x,y)+heading) are parsable as integers/NSEW, all of the non-normal actions result in ‚Äúignore‚Äù"; "in non-parsable cases, the player is terminated"
 JBM: but i'd like some confirmation ^^
 Illedan: Known command in that league, correct format, but can't be done =&gt; filtered.Else crash
 Illedan: but I totally get your point
 Illedan: Would be better to crash the player on all invalid input
 pb4: well, torpedo | torpedo --&gt; crash
 Illedan: Or ofc give it as information
 JBM: to be thought over for post-contest
 pb4: So your statement isn't 100% accurate
 pb4: (iirc)
 pb4: or was it move move&#160;?
 JBM: oh, good to know
 pb4: I'm not that sure anymore...
 JBM: i'll work on an update this evening, you can have a shot at proofreading once more
 pb4: You can have crashes with the name "Two equal commands executed."
 pb4: but I don't remember what those commands were -_-
 JBM: also, the meta question: if match ends in 0/0, 0/-1 or -1/-1, what is the match result?
 Illedan: Ye, I should print what was the 2 commands :D
 Illedan: lowest points loses
 Illedan: crash &lt; 0 health
 JBM: what's "crash &lt; 0 health"?
 Illedan: Crashing player loses vs dead player
 JBM: oh yes ofc
 JBM: as always
 eulerscheZahl: not always, see wondev woman
 JBM: my question was just because it can (and does) happen, but as far as the statement goes the outcome is quantum there
 JBM: i see wondev woman more as a "referee won't ever crash you" than an exception ^^
 JBM: gtg, i'll try and have something up by this evening
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl do you ever surface to avoid mine fields or not yet?
 eulerscheZahl: not yet
 eulerscheZahl: tried offline, was much worsei guess i haven't found the right balance yet
 kovi: you may not need surface
 kovi: silence jump itself may help out
 kovi: (both on my list....silver ideas)
 wlesavo: kinda hard to balance, but mine is now working reasonably ok
 wlesavo: still not sure if it is worth it though
 kovi: depends on the number of mines
 kovi: if you are being hit by one, that is not just damage but also detection
 icecream17: woah, silence jump? i need to make a list of ideas
 wlesavo: i use some kind of disconted eval on available space to count possible damage over time
 wlesavo: my silence is broken though
 wlesavo: silence jump wouldnot really help to escape intence mine field
 icecream17: I put "error" if there's somehow no more positions, and then pack the positions back.
 icecream17: "ERROR!!!" was found 36 times....
 icecream17: *pack -&gt; put
 CodingCaptain: Icecream17 cant get out of bronze?

 emh: 120k BFS in 50ms on empty map with starting point in middle (7,7). is it fast? doesn't seem very fast to me. the BFS is just under 100 CPU instructions
 emh: that's with AVX2. will compare with a classic BFS now
 ZarthaxX: with avx??
 ZarthaxX: how is that done
 struct: also depends on distance 
 emh: ZarthaxX BitMapGrid next = ret.Union(ret.LShift()).Union(ret.RShift()).Union(ret.LShiftCols()).Union(ret.RShiftCols());
 emh: loop until next xor ret is empty
 ZarthaxX: sheez
 ZarthaxX: i know that yes
 Counterbalance: emh it's 4x faster than mine
 ZarthaxX: holy
 emh: ohh cool. what lang what tech Counterbalance?
 ThaddeusQ3: About the C++ STOF function. I'm having rounding errors, but I cannot work out what some parts of it mean.
 Counterbalance: c++, no weird tricks, iterating over 4 directions, checking bounds + visited. I do use lambda params though for accepting the node and expanding neighbours
 emh: oh ok. I'm gonna add some more features to mine. will probably slow it down a bit
 ThaddeusQ3: Sorry that was poorly worded. I'll step out for now.
 Counterbalance: you do visit the entire map right, emh?
 Counterbalance: in the benchmark
 emh: I think so.. let me just print it out to verify
 emh: yup
 Counterbalance: nice.. I would've expected more than 120k too though..
 struct: why so?
 ZarthaxX: hi structo
 Counterbalance: having a bitmask instead of an array of nodes to visit.. 
 struct: hi ZarthaxX
 pb4: emh&#160;: do you test while(time &lt; 50ms) or while(iteration &lt; 120k) and then read time&#160;?
 pb4: results might differ
 pb4: I'll test mine out of curiosity&#160;:)
 pb4: with while(iteration &lt; 120k)
 emh: pb4 I test time every 100 iterations
 pb4: ok so equivalent
 DonFruendo: does anyone know, how the time is measured? in python i take time.time() right after my imports and another right before i output my starting location and it says 2685ms o.O
 Counterbalance: you only need to test once per 2000-3000 in this case; might get 150k
 muy31: my code right now has way too many bugs, I might have to do a complete overhaul...
 Counterbalance: DonFruendo start measuring after you read the first line of input each turn
 DonFruendo: i do that, but i'm interested in my setup turn, which should be capped at 1000ms, right?
 Counterbalance: yes, but you start measuring before you even get the initialisation input
 Counterbalance: the referee is still starting up at that time, and not ready to send data to the bots
 pb4: yay&#160;:)
 pb4: 8ms for 120k BFS on empty map from the 7,7 position
 Counterbalance: wow
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Counterbalance: what wizardry is that
 emh: pb4 wow :D nice
 emh: how does your BFS work?
 DonFruendo: 4.3 ms&#160;:-D thanks Counterbalance!
 Counterbalance: nice, DonFruendo!
 pb4: emh&#160;: same as yours
 pb4: I didn't go as  far as writing the intrinsics myself
 emh: I just have intrinsics for the col shift left/right, load/shift/store x 2. the rest is autovectorized by gcc
 MSmits: why do you guys need such fast bfs?
 pb4: Don't know :D
 pb4: Who said we did&#160;? ^^
 eulerscheZahl: we play smash the code
 MSmits: seemed like a safe assumption :P
 pb4: emh&#160;: I might have cheated, I was expanding in a square instead of a cross
 pb4: with a cross it's 15ms
 eulerscheZahl: pb4 is that the BFS of Jeff06 you mentioned here? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/stochastic-algorithm-smash-the-code/?utm_source=codingame&amp;utm_medium=details-page&amp;utm_campaign=cg-blog&amp;utm_content=stc">https://www.codingame.com/blog/stochastic-algorithm-smash-the-code/?utm_source=codingame&amp;utm_medium=details-page&amp;utm_campaign=cg-blog&amp;utm_content=stc</a>
 emh: pb4 I might have cheated too. just gonna print the last iteration so that nothing gets optimized out. but performance is abysmal with that print enabled
 kovi: thx euler
 eulerscheZahl: for what?
 eulerscheZahl: did i push you up?
 kovi: yeah
 Zenoscave: nice jump euler
 Zenoscave: Simu now?
 eulerscheZahl: not much
 eulerscheZahl: i know that my opponent will lose health when i shoot him
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: in retrospect, there was nothing magic about that BFS
 pb4: I was still learning back then...
 eulerscheZahl: just your inexperience
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 emh: pb4 oops. I was measuring empty cycles.. optimized out. hehe. but with 50 microseconds, not 50 milliseconds. well, seems like 90k anyways after correction (and adding islands intersection)
 Zenoscave: In illedan's stream he has a local editor option in settings. is that an extension?
 eulerscheZahl: timemark and video link?
 Zenoscave: sure one sec
 Counterbalance: the chrome extension
 eulerscheZahl: CGsync? CGlocal?
 Counterbalance: sync.  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codingame-sync-app/nmdombhgnofjnnaenegcdehnbkajfgbh?hl=en">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codingame-sync-app/nmdombhgnofjnnaenegcdehnbkajfgbh?hl=en</a>

 eulerscheZahl: or you just copy-paste like i do
 Zenoscave: probably one of those. Haven't used them in a while. thought they weren't usable anymore
 DonFruendo: couldn't get cglocal to work for pop os with firefox, because i fail at installing java on this machine -.-
 Astrobytes: think it's just the Spunk plugin that doesn't work any more
 Zenoscave: DonFruendo Pop OS version?
 DonFruendo: 19.10
 Counterbalance: ah yeah.. still copy-pasting here too, no good ff support. CGlocal seems not updated since 2018
 eulerscheZahl: i never saw a need to install an extension for that
 Zenoscave: DonFruendo `sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk`
 Counterbalance: and extension might be ok but a separate java app, no
 Zenoscave: Does that work?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, overkill just to move some code to CG
 Zenoscave: h. I have build scripts and keep forgetting what is most updated
 Zenoscave: I edit in both and forget to move things sometimes
 DonFruendo: yeah, did that, but still there is the message, that some main class is not found&#160;:-(
 Zenoscave: did you do `sudo apt install openjfx1
 Zenoscave: did you do `sudo apt install openjfx`
 DonFruendo: jup
 Zenoscave: PM me
 Counterbalance: crap, promotion
 icecream17: -5 away x + 6 away y = 1 away! I found the bug!

 jslo: Does anybody see any obvious mistakes here?
 jslo: I am processing the children of the current node to see if
 jslo: (1) an exit is directly connected to it
 BenjaminUrquhart: your node class doesn't follow naming conventions fyi
 jslo: (2) the node has 2 or more children and 1 node is a gateway
 BenjaminUrquhart: this is skynet?
 jslo: (3) the node only has one child hooked to a gateway
 jslo: yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: skynet 2?
 jslo: yes
 jslo: i ignore the case where the nodes have 2 children with gateways
 jslo: bc the agent can go either way
 jslo: i just skip that and go onto the next node in my BFS
 jslo: I have no idea what naming conventions are
 jslo: i just kinda freestyled this
 jslo: and i'm stuck
 jslo: does the algo. make sense?
 jslo: or am i missing something?

 BloodyTurtles: how come I don't get CP for back to the code?
 BloodyTurtles: oh wait, nvm
 BloodyTurtles: i didn't finish all the games yet
 struct: The CP doesnt update automaticly anyways
 struct: It updates at 01:00 am france time
 struct: or 02:00, cant remember
 BenjaminUrquhart: tl;dr come back tomorrow
 Kadrex: Meow.
 AntiSquid: ban
 BenjaminUrquhart: :hammer:
 BloodyTurtles: thanks
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok, i have crashes mostly fixed now and tracking actually works
 BenjaminUrquhart: my current timeouts are related to java loading new classes
 Astrobytes: JVM warmup?
 Astrobytes: Can you not get around that by instantiating a dummy class on turn 1?
 Astrobytes: *many instances of
 Astrobytes: Can't remember the details, I hat eJAva
 Astrobytes: *hate Java
 BenjaminUrquhart: that was the plan, just didn't get around to doing it yet
 Astrobytes: fix it Benjamin :P
 drwatson: found this site today and just solved my 3rd problem.. looks like this is like leetcode but far more interesting 
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: also I lied, division by zero still exists it just happens less
 BenjaminUrquhart: aaaaaa
 Astrobytes: Are you debugging locally? It does help a lot
 drwatson: which problem are you guys talking about?
 Astrobytes: drwatson There's a contest running just now <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code</a>
 icecream17: Wow! 2 losses only? I thought I only improved a little
 drwatson: @astobytes. Thanks just registered.. 
 Astrobytes: drwatson awesome, enjoy. Also, if you type the beginning of a username and press Tab it should autocomplete the username for you, no need for the @
 AntiSquid: there are many sites far more interesting than leetcode, just look up the curated list on quora 
 AntiSquid: also leetcode requires you to pay for some of their puzzles if i remember correctly
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes how's your bot?
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid, just the same. Haven't submitted anything. Got up at 3pm today lol, not done much tbh
 drwatson: Astrobytes got it 
 drwatson: AntiSquid yep leetcode requires payment, but they have some company specific questions that's literally only reason I use it 
 Astrobytes: I'm real lazy to do anything atm tbh
 AntiSquid: should have gotten csj to make another wacky game
 Astrobytes: lol please no
 AntiSquid: first was a queen gang bang gamesecond a real life kitchen simulator
 AntiSquid: i mean just as chaotic as a real kitchen
 Astrobytes: It was indeed
 AntiSquid: then who do you want to create another game?
 Astrobytes: I can't say I really have a preference
 Astrobytes: csj might make a different kind of game next time since he discovered search algos in BR2K
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: i bet he will still come up with a weird concept
 Astrobytes: tbf, none of his concepts were bad so far
 AntiSquid: no just odd 
 AntiSquid: weird/ funny
 Astrobytes: Yeah that's cool tho'
 Astrobytes: If it works as a game
 Astrobytes: *on CG
 AntiSquid: alright got to go sleep, i still need to work tomorrow although from home
 AntiSquid: gn8
 Astrobytes: gn man, take it easy

 drwatson: Does 'Play my code' affect the score&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 Zenoscave: no

 BenjaminUrquhart: I am top 400
 BenjaminUrquhart: very competitive
 Zenoscave: whoa
 BenjaminUrquhart: boulet here with ocaml
 emh: pb4 I am at 200-230k BFS per 50ms now. wonder how yours got so fast
 icecream17: This person in 414th always beats me with only torpedo, how?
 izik1: Better prediction perhaps?
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/443622918">https://www.codingame.com/replay/443622918</a>
 YannT: emh: why do you need so many BFS I don't get it?
 emh: I got addicted to optimizing it hehe don't know for sure the use case yet
 BenjaminUrquhart: icecream17 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443630631">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443630631</a>
 YannT: I only use BFS for torpedo pathing and you really don't have that many to test :p
 emh: well I hope I can do search trees with mine and opponent actions, they grow exponentially so then I guess I will use BFS in each branch but not sure yet
 BenjaminUrquhart: I precompute all the possible torpedo destinations for every spot on the map on the first turn 
 emh: I use some BFSes for scoring pathing
 emh: don't go where the reachable cell count drops a lot
 YannT: ah, I have a floodfill for that
 icecream17: my floodfill timeouts
 YannT: which I guess is more like a DFS
 emh: what's the difference between floodfill and BFS?
 BenjaminUrquhart: weak floodfill
 BenjaminUrquhart: they're basically the same thing
 YannT: not  much except it's essentially a DFS
 YannT: but for counting tiles it doesn't matter
 YannT: in the end it's the same number of iterations&#160;:)
 emh: ok
 BenjaminUrquhart: [CG]Thibaud stop beating me smh
 [CG]Thibaud: coming to Silver hopefully
 BenjaminUrquhart: :eyes:
 [CG]Thibaud: interesting how a simple change in the strategy changes the ranking
 [CG]Thibaud: I was 70
 [CG]Thibaud: decided to charge torpedo before silence
 [CG]Thibaud: now i'm top 10in Bronze
 [CG]Thibaud: it's so satisfying
 YannT: it's a very fun game&#160;:)
 kovi: but that is no a simple changethat is a key of this game
 Astrobytes: *simple to implement, strategically complex
 YannT: it's not *that
 [CG]Thibaud: my initial idea was to charge silence while opponent moves and I get an idea where he is.
 YannT: simple to implement
 BenjaminUrquhart: mildly infuriating: in all my games against you my bot detects it's been stopped and proceeds to silence in the wrong direction
 BenjaminUrquhart: spotted*
 YannT: you pretty much always wanna  have a torpedo ready because you never know when your deduction is gonna give you a good firing option
 [CG]Thibaud: that is a simple change: private CommandType getNextCommandToCharge() {
 Astrobytes: That's more what I was referring to
 [CG]Thibaud: bad end of submit
 BenjaminUrquhart: finally
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443636677">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443636677</a>
 [CG]Thibaud: oh well
 BenjaminUrquhart: I messed with the order of neighboring nodes
 Astrobytes: Onwards and upwards Thibaud
 YannT: [CG]Thibaud: you should do a thing so you don't surface for  no reason, it makes a big difference too
 YannT: no running into corners
 BenjaminUrquhart: ^ that's my next step
 [CG]Thibaud: but for that I would need to look at more than just the 4 adjacents cells 
 BenjaminUrquhart: is that a problem?
 [CG]Thibaud: well
 [CG]Thibaud: I like simple stuff
 BenjaminUrquhart: I see
 [CG]Thibaud: but ideally, I shuold do that
 YannT: it makes a big ranking difference in bronze
 Astrobytes: Still simple, just with some added simplicity&#160;;)
 LTony: Hello guys, in python, when I print the opponent_orders with print(opponent_orders, file=sys.stderr)... I only receive the first instruction. For example, for MOVE N SILENCE&#160;: I only read MOVE N. How can I read the second instruction&#160;?
 [CG]Thibaud: it's not the second instruction
 [CG]Thibaud: it's the charge
 izik1: You can't see what they charge
 YannT: good pathing  + basic deduction + decent torpedoes + silence 0 spam = silver&#160;;)
 [CG]Thibaud: and you don't need it
 icecream17: ugh my floodfill keeps timeouting what should i do?
 YannT: you should make it better
 Astrobytes: Stop it from timing out
 YannT: (check that it's not infinite because you don't handle visited tiles properly)
 Astrobytes: ^
 [CG]Thibaud: floodfill to find torpedo range&#160;?
 LTony: Ok but at least when they fire a torpedo, I like to see were. If they write MOVE N | TORPEDO 3 5, I would like to catch TORPEDO 3 5
 YannT: it's for pathing [CG]Thibaud
 YannT: go where there's more space
 YannT: to not run into corners&#160;:)
 [CG]Thibaud: I guess that if I do FF for torpedoes, I can do it for pathing
 Astrobytes: Of course
 [CG]Thibaud: :D
 icecream17: floodfill to avoid going into a small square or rectangle or something with no exits
 [CG]Thibaud: I'm so lazy
 [CG]Thibaud: it will do for tonight
 icecream17: LTony, I get the whole thing in a string
 [CG]Thibaud: tomorrow at lunch time maybe
 Astrobytes: I'm lazy in this contest too tbh
 icecream17: "MOVE E|TORPEDO  5 7"
 icecream17: but i'm javascript so idk
 LTony: thank you, will try to investigate why I don't get that in Python
 icecream17: wow, i'm at that point where i know why i'm bad but i don't know how to improve it because the goal is so general
 icecream17: better check the todo
 Astrobytes: LTony split the string at |
 icecream17: I wish opponents (code) saw the messages too....
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 icecream17: Then I could do 'MOVE N|MSG MOVE S'
 icecream17: Instead I do more useful information
 icecream17: Although if the opponent figures it out....
 BenjaminUrquhart: the thing is, it then becomes trivial to break otehr bots
 BenjaminUrquhart: through bad input parsing
 BenjaminUrquhart: you would be also able to guess who wrote the other bot
 icecream17: oh yeah, maybe not...
 BenjaminUrquhart: and most bots that use MSG do so to print actual debug info
 BenjaminUrquhart: or just to flex
 YannT: they print their deduction information
 YannT: which is good to check yours against
 xarnthehero: I'm getting weird timeout issues, does anyone know if something is up? I'm not running much code...

 drwatson: for wood league, is it a good strategy to stay away from opponent as much as possible?
 icecream17: haven't tried
 icecream17: but you need to track the opponent if you want to do that, and if you can track the opponent....
 icecream17: well maybe... i'm just rambling do whatever
 icecream17: send the share link of the game
 drwatson: no go ahead really, I'm kind of confused as what am i supposed to do
 icecream17: In my first submit I moved N if I could, then S if I could, then E, then W
 drwatson: icecream17 I'm not done yet, just moving around randomly right now
 izik1: I don't even try to move north, hopefully don't need to implement surfacing to get out of wood&#160;;-;
 izik1: wood 2 that is
 izik1: :v
 icecream17: well, you don't need that much for moving.
 drwatson: icecream17 that's exactly what I'm doing, try to move SEWN in that order if not surface, also fire torpedo in random direction but havn't implemented this one yer
 icecream17: If you want, you can impletement "turn left if you can", because a ball can happen more times than a long line.
 izik1: bleh, some of my losses are because I torp myself as bad as I torp my opponent
 izik1: (2 for 2)
 ZarthaxX: LOL Astrobytes good meme recursive shit
 izik1: in otherwords, if I'm on the tile I'm torping, maybe move _first_
 icecream17: only be willing to torp yourself if your opponent has 1 life or something. i never torp myself, but i should put that in my ideas.
 icecream17: Torp yourself if you have 3 lives and your opponent has 1 life and you're both on the same square... now I realize my targeting system needs upgrading.
 izik1: I mean, if you and your opponent have the same movement algo (eg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443647815">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443647815</a>) it seems like torping yourself for 1 and them for 2 is better than not torping at all?
 izik1: Obviously a better movement algo would be good too
 icecream17: yeah it seems. also 1000 people?? so much morew people joined....
 BenjaminUrquhart: almost 4k registered
 icecream17: I'm 44th in bronze, so what place am I?

 BenjaminUrquhart: I see nothing wrong with this
 BenjaminUrquhart: :eyes:
 icecream17: nothing wrong at all. just wonder
 Astrobytes: icecream17 Illeda n and eulerscheZah l literally got this out in 2 days, based on a prototype of a game that CG already had. So I think they're quite entitled to compete&#160;;)

 icecream17: like... oh well
 Astrobytes: They're pretty good icecream17, that's how&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out for now. GLHF everyone
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have developed a master plan
 BenjaminUrquhart: leave my submission overnight and have other people push me to silver
 drwatson: I think I found a bug
 BenjaminUrquhart: hm?
 BenjaminUrquhart: drwatson
 BenjaminUrquhart: a bug in the game or a bug in your code
 drwatson: my output string says MOVE E TORPEDO when i debug, but actual output is MOVE S TORPEDO
 drwatson: bug in the game i think
 icecream17: Well, if you output twice, the game does move 1 move 2
 drwatson: I'm not outputting twice though, one of the print is std error

 drwatson: but have a look at the image, res is string. 
 HMu0510: wonjin
 icecream17: hmmm....
 drwatson: anything icecream17
 icecream17: i don't see anything wrong
 drwatson: in my image or game reply?
 icecream17: both. maybe look at the code or prints idk
 izik1: Can silence moves "jump"? In other words if you have an already visited cell or island in the middle of your silence move, can you still make that move? The wording isn't super clear, common sense says no though
 icecream17: silence = teleport
 izik1: So you _can_ go through stuff? As long as you don't land on it?
 icecream17: yeah i think so
 drwatson: i mean, I'm giving output as move e, it's taking it as move s..  
 izik1: hmm, that sounds useful for getaways (even if they know where you are, they can't torp through islands) but it also sounds like my tracking algo is going to go through _pain_
 icecream17: pretty hard to implement because most people don't realize. also drwatson send the whole code, i'll ask someone who knows more about python
 icecream17: or other language
 izik1: At least silence doesn't let you move diagonally
 icecream17: I just silence E 0 for now.
 izik1: yeah, I'll probably do something like "silence but actually just move how I already would", the problem comes with the fact that my enemy gets to draw a lot of plusses on my tracking algo&#160;;-;
 izik1: Oh, I should also use torps for tracking
 izik1: :facepalm:
 icecream17: I use everything. But I haven't implemented silence = 1, 2, 3, or 4 yet
 izik1: Sonar?
 icecream17: Only if I already charged torpedo, mine, and silence, but I've seen someone use it with Mine MIne Mine
 izik1: mm
 izik1: I don't have mine yet
 izik1: Cuz wood 1
 izik1: Too busy setting up base work
 izik1: although, my wood 2 bot made it to rank 31 wood 1
 izik1: :thinking:
 izik1: Hmm, I also need to make sure I keep track of where the opponent might be able to predict _I_ am
 izik1: So that I don't waste silence
 izik1: This game plays a lot like Clue to me
 izik1: In terms of a few things
 izik1: Like data mining
 izik1: and data secrecy for that matter
 BenjaminUrquhart: izik1 you cannot silence through invalid tiles (islands/already visited)
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's not teleportation
 izik1: whew
 izik1: That makes it a lot easier to deal with
 BenjaminUrquhart: I see your current bot just moves side to side
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh wait it torpedos too it just never hit my bot :thinking:
 Seanny: Hi, I'm fairly new to programming, and I taught myself C++.  I've been stuck at ghost legs for months now!  Where can I get help for this?
 BenjaminUrquhart: ghost legs?
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/ghost-legs">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/ghost-legs</a>&#160;?
 Seanny: ya, this one
 MostComplicatedUsername: For the output, are commands separated with a " | " or "|"?
 icecream17: "|"
 MostComplicatedUsername: okay thx
 MostComplicatedUsername: Seanny for ghost legs-My solution was to create a coordinate system, then look at the diagram line by line. Every time I found a -, I increased or decreased the "x" value, depending on where the - is
 MostComplicatedUsername: Then repeat for each letter
 izik1: It doesn't actually seem like it cares if there's a space or not, at one point in time I was accidentally outputting "| "
 izik1: I think it splits by "|" and then trims
 icecream17: Oh. The enemy actions you get don't have a space. So I assumed
 izik1: Admittedly, I thought of trying to crash the other bot by using their output string against them, and then remembered that the game reparses it
 izik1: haha, my bot can completely lose all hope of finding the opponent
 izik1: because of silence
 icecream17: I use the MSG for debug and also a face depending on my health to make the opponent feel guilty
 izik1: oof

 Seanny: @MostComplicatedUsername Thanks for the hint.. I need to stew on this...
 izik1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443658355">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443658355</a> I lost this because my bot completely lost the boss lol
 izik1: Wait, so, silence can let you move 4 in each direction? whew, that's a big cross section
 izik1: and an expensive repaint of my position tracking
 icecream17: I deal with silence by adding possibleOpp positions that may differ from the actual start and be negative as long as the end result is on water Most people don't spam silence, but with ones that do always have from 2-70 possible positions. Somehow there's always a bug with my handleOpponent() function. Always.
 izik1: Where does 70 come up as the max number?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Did you assume you would get it perfect first try?
 icecream17: I assumed I wouldn't get past Wood2. Took me 5 days. This is day 2 on bronze and day 7 in total. (6 days wood, 2 bronze, math!)
 icecream17: I think if you write down ideas and keep working on your code you'll do better than you think.
 MostComplicatedUsername: I have ideas
 MostComplicatedUsername: But no idea how to implement them
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;:\
 icecream17: Write your ideas down away, if you share I could share how I would do it... (and steal the idea but....) Just break the problem into smaller problems. They may or may not each have bugs but you solve the problem in general
 icecream17: *away -&gt; anyway
 BenjaminUrquhart: izik1 is the bot in the arena your current code?
 izik1: not quite
 izik1: I'm busy writing new code
 izik1: but my current code is almost functionally identical
 izik1: I have more ideas than implementations lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: your bot's motion is very easy to predict
 izik1: yeah :v
 izik1: Not a concern quite yet
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443666077">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443666077</a>
 izik1: It _will_ be
 izik1: just not yet
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thumbsup:
 izik1: namely: once you use silence, it just completely dies
 izik1: it completely loses where you are
 BenjaminUrquhart: sounds fun
 izik1: in my current code, it just resets your possible positions, but that's not really a solution
 MostComplicatedUsername: Just expand it
 MostComplicatedUsername: Don't reset
 izik1: That's what I'm working on.
 izik1: as I said, more ideas than implementations
 izik1: I have a longer term idea that I basically unfold their movements to figure out where they _can't_ be (can't move left then silence right) and even longer term ideas related to keeping as much information around as possible...
 BenjaminUrquhart: "can't move left then silence right"thanks brb implementing into tracker
 izik1: *shrug* I learned it second hand anyway, although I did verify it for personal comfort
 izik1: I am _really_ glad that I like making heuristic bots, because this is a great challenge for that
 izik1: I have 1 lines of note for my implementation of handling silence and the method doesn't even have the basic impl yet
 izik1: *13

 BenjaminUrquhart: of course, game.spread has a few more lines to it
 izik1: lol, that's basically the idea
 BenjaminUrquhart: "I am _really_ glad that I like making heuristic bots"So basically me
 izik1: hahaha
 izik1: Here, have some bit duplication logic for that :p `(1 &lt;&lt; (max - min) - 1) &lt;&lt; min` probably not useful for you though
 TheBrokenPonyAndHisDog_ed48: bruh
 izik1:&#160;?
 TheBrokenPonyAndHisDog_ed48: my name
 izik1: That's a long name
 TheBrokenPonyAndHisDog_ed48: ikr
 MostComplicatedUsername: Ha random torpedo firing
 izik1: That sounds like a _great_ way for me to find where you are :3
 MostComplicatedUsername: ikr
 MostComplicatedUsername: But 
 MostComplicatedUsername: im in wood
 MostComplicatedUsername: 2
 MostComplicatedUsername: so ya
 izik1: mm, I've had my predictor since wood 2 :v
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;:\
 MostComplicatedUsername: I can make one now
 MostComplicatedUsername: So ya
 MostComplicatedUsername: :0
 izik1: as soon as I stopped dying to lack of movement I got to wood 1 though...
 MostComplicatedUsername: If torpedo damages opponent
 izik1: grats on being able to make one
 MostComplicatedUsername: Then opponent 
 MostComplicatedUsername: must be within 
 MostComplicatedUsername: 1 square
 MostComplicatedUsername: and if opponent takes 
 MostComplicatedUsername: 2
 MostComplicatedUsername:  damage, opponent must be on square
 MostComplicatedUsername: that was targeted
 izik1: woah, I totally didn't notice that opp_life is a thing you have access to o-o
 MostComplicatedUsername: yeah
 MostComplicatedUsername: Wait...
 MostComplicatedUsername: Did I just...
 MostComplicatedUsername: Think of something you didn't???
 MostComplicatedUsername: Woah
 izik1: lol
 izik1: It isn't _that_ hard
 izik1: I also am not sure how much I need it right now
 MostComplicatedUsername: Eh
 MostComplicatedUsername: It's useful, you can narrow opponent's position to like 9 squares, and potentially 1
 MostComplicatedUsername: Once you get it to 1, you're set
 izik1: Until they silence :p
 MostComplicatedUsername: Idk what that is 
 MostComplicatedUsername: Im in wood 2
 BenjaminUrquhart: get to wood 1
 BenjaminUrquhart: smh
 BenjaminUrquhart: then I can have a fair match against you
 MostComplicatedUsername: :upside_down:
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah you're computing
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;???
 BenjaminUrquhart: submitting
 MostComplicatedUsername: oh
 BenjaminUrquhart: I know where you are :eyes:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443670559">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443670559</a>
 izik1: Bleh, bit map is confusion sometimes
 BenjaminUrquhart: my map is a bitmap
 izik1: as is mine
 izik1: specifically it's an array of u16
 izik1: Really handy for some bit manip
 MostComplicatedUsername: Wood 1!
 MostComplicatedUsername: yay
 izik1: Nice!

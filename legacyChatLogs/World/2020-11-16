 ClockSort: what do you mean, "losing an openref"? you mean newing something that becomes garbage?
 Zenoscave: If a var goes out of scope and is no longer referenced
 Zenoscave: yeah
 ClockSort: ok to create local-scoped value-type primitives  in a function? or do those end up with the GC?
 ClockSort: based on my research, that should be ok
 Zenoscave: those will be stack so fine
 ClockSort: what about setting a Tuple&lt;&gt; (value type) to a New Tuple&lt;&gt; value? does the old value get GC'd?
 Zenoscave: yup
 ClockSort: it shouldn't since Tuple is value type.
 Zenoscave: It is?
 Zenoscave: Thought tuple was ref
 ClockSort: oh wow it was changed. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2410710/why-is-the-new-tuple-type-in-net-4-0-a-reference-type-class-and-not-a-value-t">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2410710/why-is-the-new-tuple-type-in-net-4-0-a-reference-type-class-and-not-a-value-t</a>
 Zenoscave: Microsoft made all tuple types reference types in the interests of simplicity.
 Zenoscave: Yeah
 ClockSort: well that's probably my problem, let me test it...
 ClockSort: yes that's it, i'm creating thousands of tuples and letting GC clean up. lol
 Zenoscave: lol nice find
 ClockSort: whoa, there's a ValueTuple in C# 7 which is a value-type tuple
 Zenoscave: what vers. is on CG again? time for the faq
 Zenoscave: 8.0
 ClockSort: *phew*
 ClockSort: let's see if that improves things.
 rockstar555: hii world
 ClockSort: hello rockstar
 ClockSort: did you know that stars are also rocks? just really wet ones.
 rockstar555: hello ClockSort
 Zenoscave: is plasma wet? 
 Zenoscave: never thought of it that way
 rockstar555: thanks for information
 rockstar555: hello Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: hi rockstar555
 rockstar555: lets play clash of code
 ClockSort: i don't have time, only  172 more hours available for the fall challenge
 Zenoscave: ^^^
 rockstar555: okkk
 rockstar555: let me go match was started
 rockstar555: clash of code
 rockstar555: hii 
 ClockSort: oh sweet, i think that fixed it
 Zenoscave: only d=3? full or beam?
 FahrendraKhoirul: kuy play clash of code
 ClockSort: you looking at my bot?
 Zenoscave: perhaps&#160;;)
 ClockSort: that's running at 5ms to combat GC :P
 FahrendraKhoirul: wow
 FahrendraKhoirul: that cool
 ClockSort: let me submit this...
 Zenoscave: no throttle on time?
 NinjaDoggy: GC can be combated pretty effeciently
 NinjaDoggy: initialize all the variables you need on turn 1
 NinjaDoggy: and never let GC do anything&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: lol hey NinjaDoggy
 NinjaDoggy: hey zeno!
 Zenoscave: how's your bot
 NinjaDoggy: it's not bad
 ClockSort: i'm setting my C# BFS search to run until 40ms is up
 rockstar555: hii
 NinjaDoggy: i'm full rewriting in C++
 NinjaDoggy: and i had an AHA! moment&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: should be top 20 minimum again soon&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: oh no. Not a famous Ninja aha
 NinjaDoggy: hehe... last time i had that
 ClockSort: @ninjadoggy what search alg you using?
 NinjaDoggy: was on Code of ice and fire :P
 Zenoscave: I remember
 NinjaDoggy: dijkstra's to solve the game
 NinjaDoggy: just bfs
 NinjaDoggy: should be able to go depth 20+ or something
 ClockSort: i'm getting depth 6 or 7 bfs in C#
 Zenoscave: full bfs depth 20!?
 NinjaDoggy: soons&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: are you MAD
 ClockSort: that's mad, you must be trimming
 NinjaDoggy: cast/brew depth 20+
 NinjaDoggy: current java bot gets like depth 10 with cast/brew
 ClockSort: it does help to cut learns
 Zenoscave: no learn?
 NinjaDoggy: i don't think learning is too important yet
 NinjaDoggy: just learn first X turns&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: Testing now...
 NinjaDoggy: a lot of bots have success with it
 Donotalo: i'm only casting and resting upto depth 20 easily, to find brewable orders from a given inventory
 rockstar555: hello averyone
 Zenoscave: I do both first x and then learns in between
 NinjaDoggy: yea cast/rest can go really deep
 NinjaDoggy: yea that sounds good as well
 NinjaDoggy: where if learning doesn't impede anything
 NinjaDoggy: just learn because it's helpful later
 Zenoscave: fair
 ClockSort: if you tame the GC, can you really get much better perf out of C++ vs C# or Java?
 NinjaDoggy: yea it's huge for java at least
 NinjaDoggy: in my experience
 rockstar555: C++
 D.FooL: Why i'm not getting a 100% though i passed all the test cases?
 NinjaDoggy: for what? a puzzle?
 NinjaDoggy: the test cases in IDE are different from the cases when you hit submit
 NinjaDoggy: (to prevent hard coding)
 rockstar555: hey tell me what was the best among java c++ and c#
 NinjaDoggy: depends...
 NinjaDoggy: C++ is best for speed
 NinjaDoggy: C# is mostly just better java? I think?
 NinjaDoggy: java is best if that's what you're most comfortable with
 rockstar555: thanks NinjaDoggy

 D.FooL: Is this a kind of bug?
 D.FooL: This is my 2nd time
 rockstar555: can you tell me about turbo C++
 ClockSort: @ninjadoggy do you know how many states you're looking at during a search?

 rockstar555: tell me about codingame
 rockstar555: anybody here
 Uljahn: rockstar555: yes
 rockstar555: join me on above link
 anantaCodes: Please dont spam here
 Ifthel: I doubt this is the place to look for pubg teammates rockstar555
 anantaCodes: I checked Eulers Heroku app containing some 1200 puzzles from Codingames? Does it mean those are all the questions that we get while competing too?
 phord: "Top 100 Companies" has a search field that says "Search for a friend, school or country".  But searching for "country" doesn't work here.
 eulerscheZahl: no, i would have to update my database. i guess i have 98% or so
 rockstar555: hii
 anantaCodes: 98% is impressive too.Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: it's a dual use sadly. it can help you understand a reverse or finish a clash after the 15min. but also help you cheat&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i have a script for the DB update, give me a second...
 eulerscheZahl: 1195 puzzles =&gt; 1231updated
 rockstar555: hii
 Remus_: good morningGot up to work but still ended up here
 anantaCodes: Thanks a lot Euler&#160;!
 raymoo: can you buy a spell if you can only afford it with the tax accumulated on it?
 Remus_: afaik, no
 raymoo: thanks
 rockstar555: anybody knows websites for playing games
 eulerscheZahl: go to miniclip.com and leave us alone
 NinjaDoggy: euler, if you don't mind me asking...
 NinjaDoggy: what's nodes = X and d = 13
 NinjaDoggy: especially the nodes part :O
 NinjaDoggy: 46k? how D:
 Nerchio: not-java for starters
 NinjaDoggy: yea he's using C#, but I just rewrote in C++
 NinjaDoggy: and only getting 30-40k "iterations" of bfs
 eulerscheZahl: d is the depth
 NinjaDoggy: yeh that's obvious... but nodes? :D
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm still optimizing performance, i think i have a good idea to completely clutter my code
 NinjaDoggy: lol nice
 eulerscheZahl: nodes = single states that i can reach
 rockstar555: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.gg/arg8qgQp">https://discord.gg/arg8qgQp</a>
 eulerscheZahl: some nodes might be equal
 eulerscheZahl: you've been warned Rockspringa
 eulerscheZahl: rockstar555 (sorry, tab completion)
 NinjaDoggy: oh... I think i might know why
 NinjaDoggy: i count the same way but
 NinjaDoggy: i prune out nodes really well
 NinjaDoggy: so my depth  conversion is better but less nodes
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i do: expand node() =&gt; increase counter =&gt; add to set which removes duplicates
 NinjaDoggy: ok yea lemme try that method of counting
 eulerscheZahl: now rockstar is insulting me in private messages
 Nerchio: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: taking 1 for the team
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 eulerscheZahl: so, back to my madness, afk
 Remus_: I can sometimes match your Ai in the first 75% of the match, euler, then you destroy me in the last 25%
 NinjaDoggy: ok phew  there we go, i'm getting roughly 120k "nodes" by how you're counting
 NinjaDoggy: I was going to say... what magic is he doing is C# that's faster than my current sim ._.
 eulerscheZahl: working on it. it will be faster i think
 Nerchio: euler probably gets the most out of his language :P
 Nerchio: still much easier to do with c++
 xineohp: euler do you think your current search will stay good for higher leagues as well, with slight modifications?
 rockstar555: you dont know who i am
 eulerscheZahl: xineohp i still have some ideas how to improve. not sure if my current bot will reach legend as it is
 eulerscheZahl: rockstar555 now stop spamming or the next strike will be permanent
 rockstar555: i am a hacker
 VizGhar: Can I create multithreaded bot?
 rockstar555: Sorry guys
 VizGhar: might be fun to compute graph nodes even while waiting for referee or other players
 eulerscheZahl: yes but you only get 1 core anyways VizGhar
 eulerscheZahl: and your process gets paused
 VizGhar: ah i see&#160;:)
 rockstar555: how i can make games
 rockstar555: can i make a multiplayer game using coding

 eulerscheZahl: so much about my rewrite
 VizGhar: I want your life guys&#160;:) I have like 1hr a day for coding CG...
 VizGhar: work, family, sleep until I get out of rat race
 yhyoxx: it's okay
 yhyoxx: we're doing all of this for the things u have achieved
 yhyoxx: i dont even have a job 
 yhyoxx: im so broke&#160;:'(
 eulerscheZahl: i took a week off from my job just for this contest
 Westicles: Heh heh, you are so ethical.  Sitting there typing all day, who would know
 rockstar555: the game was fun queen i like this battle royal game thank
 rockstar555: you
 Westicles: Well, except for all the witches and cauldrons and whatnot
 rockstar555: can you tell me websites for coding like codingame.com 
 Q12: which spells are repeatable?
 Remus_: All except the first 4
 Nerchio: no
 Nerchio: the ones that give you ingredients without sacrificing any are not repeatable too
 Remus_: true
 Remus_: didn't notice that
 Q12: so the first 4 and the ones that are  free not repeatable, yeah?
 Nerchio: i think so
 Q12: thanks
 LLG: what happens if 2 players issue a LEARN command on the same spell in the same turn?
 Westicles: All the ones here without a negative number

 eulerscheZahl: someone edit the wiki right now
 AbundantPuddle: Nope, pretty sure that's their real life name.
 Westicles: His real name is Euler Merkel
 rockstar555: tell me best software for designing games
 AbundantPuddle: Somebody give wikipedia the D!
 rockstar555: what is D
 WINWINWIN: Its a programming Language
 Westicles: You are too young for that answer
 rockstar555:  I don't know about this types of programming language
 Westicles: It is one of those languages where you google something and it turns out to be obsolete

 deoxify: oh thanks i thought that button was for something else
 rockstar555: hey you don't give me my answer
 rockstar555: is Unity best than Unreal engine
 AbundantPuddle: I think you have a lot of learning to do rockstar. I would lean towards Unity being more beginner-friendly. However, which one is "better" is purely subjective.
 rockstar555: this is the logo made by me
 rockstar555: ok
 LordSkaven: are we allowed to use threads or async programming?
 AbundantPuddle: Actually let me rephrase that as well, it is subjective in a lot of cases, but depending on the application, one may fair better than the other as well.
 rmuskovets: LordSkaven: i think yes, but afaik the runner VMs are given only 1 core
 AbundantPuddle: iirc, that is what somebody said earlier in chat.
 LordSkaven: thanks
 LordSkaven: I am probably getting ahead of myself, I am still not sure how to generate my graph fully, all the work I have done with BFS has been with pathfinding and generating the grid there is easy lol
 rmuskovets: what puzzle are you doing?
 rockstar555: bye gueys
 LordSkaven: Fall challenge
 AbundantPuddle: Bye rockstar. Good luck.

 LordSkaven: rmuskovets: I am not sure yet. using a tree for the simulations. I hear some people are using BFS to transverse it, not sure if that is the best way yet.
 rmuskovets: I'm trying to make a simple sim too
 rmuskovets: especially for ranking potions
 rockstar555: Sorry 
 LordSkaven: yeah, at the moment my sim is just a block of foreach's. Trying to figure out how to make it more recursive and adjustable
 rockstar555: ok tell me about Unreal engine
 rockstar555: this help me for making games
 rmuskovets: like "if (isBestBalance(potion, allPotions)) { actionsQueue = paths[potion.delta] }

 SabertheLost: cool
 Westicles: Mysterious new American in the top 10
 SabertheLost: I will not make it. My still do not look into what it should make. Just collect spells and makes ingredients then brew anything it can .. 
 eulerscheZahl: mysterious python at 31
 rmuskovets: euler, you're at #1 now? cool
 rmuskovets: so many c++ at top of leaderboard...
 Uljahn: that python is pretty cool, would like to read his postmortem
 rmuskovets: what does that decimal number in leaderboard say?
 rmuskovets: percentage of wins?
 Uljahn: TrueSkill rank
 rmuskovets: wikipedia says it's a microsoft product, am I missing something?
 Uljahn: that's just an algo similar to Elo
 rmuskovets: is it a good idea to build a graph with nodes=recipes and 'lines'=inventory after that recipe?
 rmuskovets: i think i'll do that vice-versa
 Uljahn: that's the best way to learn
 Uljahn: you do both and profile
 rmuskovets: then I'll probably be able to implement some algo like DFT
 ngxingyu: is genetic algorithm good for this?
 rmuskovets: my brain looks at it like the lines are some changes, so latter is more intuitive
 rmuskovets: also if I have a starting inventory, how to represent that as a Delta?
 rmuskovets: (^ rhetoric question)
 Westicles: GA isn't great for 50ms type of puzzles
 ngxingyu: i see okay thanks @Westicles
 kreska: im 428 this is super addictive:D
 rmuskovets: in what league?
 kreska: bronze
 rmuskovets: :open_mouth:
 Clagus: are the bugs fixed already?
 Clagus: ok, I can see that they are [FIXED] all spells repeatable
 rmuskovets: i think i'm going to use mcts... it looks good
 LordSkaven: yeah it looks promising rmuskovets
 eulerscheZahl: return (ActiveSpells | spell.Mask)&#160;!= 0;
 yhyoxx: woah
 yhyoxx: i never used | 
 yhyoxx: outside bash
 eulerscheZahl: bitwise ORand it should be &amp;
 rmuskovets: i think i could write a postmortem after this challenge ends
 Westicles: We should all make a solemn pact to start with 20 learns
 eulerscheZahl: first 20, no picking
 Westicles: right
 rmuskovets: in the 20 first turns
 wlesavo: and the winner would be the one breaking the pact
 eulerscheZahl: no, that would just be a disqualification
 rmuskovets: so that both players get the 20 learned spells
 rmuskovets: wlesavo if so, just make a bot that does a first WAIT
 wlesavo: oh i see, we should make all the move besides learn 0 be non active in referee until turn 20
 rmuskovets: can I make vscode also treat comment+indent as a proper indent?
 rmuskovets: like this
 rmuskovets: like this:// Types
 rmuskovets: cg editor does treat that as a indent and lets me fold/unfold
 rmuskovets: vscode doesn't
 rmuskovets: ah, I just need to place a #region
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds like C#
 rmuskovets: i mean inside of a comment
 rmuskovets: like // #region Game loop
 rmuskovets: also, I'm writing TS
 rmuskovets: turned out I'm writing a DFT
 rmuskovets: lol
 rmuskovets: instead of MCTS
 mcts: oh wow I need to change my name I just received a ping for your message ^^
 [CG]Thibaud: :D
 rmuskovets: I think setting a depth limit on recursive DFT is a good idea, isn't it?
 rmuskovets: maybe I could overcome this by not including the recipes that give free stuff to my algo
 Csipcsirip: dft? like Discrete Fourier transform?
 rmuskovets: nah, depth first traversal
 rmuskovets: i dont even know what's a Fourier transform
 Csipcsirip: oh u mean DFS
 eulerscheZahl: congrats pb4
 SujalAI: How do I find the optimal path to a spell?
 SujalAI: I am a newbie in coding so can you suggest some algorithms
 eulerscheZahl: i think even top players only found the optimal path by chance
 rmuskovets: I'm currently trying a depth first traversal SujalAI but that algo can easily timeout
 SujalAI: oh
 SujalAI: I guess I should look it up
 rmuskovets: it's a pretty simple one
 SujalAI: I heard someone is using dijkstra 
 LuckyJ.: Why not using a bfs instead of a dfs?
 Westicles: Seems like people are saying BFS with pruning
 SujalAI: which is easier to implement lol?
 andrefpoliveira: Both are pretty simple
 rmuskovets: they're kinda the same difficulty
 rmuskovets: that is "simple"
 SujalAI: Unfortunately I have never used either of them
 andrefpoliveira: Ahah the simpler you will find probably
 rmuskovets: for djikstra or a-star you need a heuristic function that'll give a estimate path length to the goal iirc
 Westicles: And I declare the optimal number of learn 0's to start is... 11 or 12
 SujalAI: I don't think heuristic is required for dijkstra
 Remus_: dfs didn't really work for meit was really fast compared to bfs but it made some nonsense moves with sorted actins
 SujalAI: or is it?
 AbundantPuddle: Or you can just hard code every possible combination.
 SujalAI: I didn't understand how a path finding algo could be applied to this, because there are vectors for nodes
 rmuskovets: you can give it pretty much anything as a node type
 rmuskovets: I'm using recipes as edges and inventory after the recipe as node
 SujalAI: i thought of that too but didn't understand how to implemrnt it
 SujalAI: and also some spells disappear after using them]
 Uljahn: they just become inactive until you REST
 Remus_: @rmuskovetsif you only store inventory, how do you know which recipes exits/castable at that point?
 eulerscheZahl: click the gear (viewer settings) to still see the spells
 rmuskovets: I also store all recipes
 SujalAI: ive seen some spells disappear and not jus exhausted
 SujalAI: does this really happen?
 Uljahn: no, show a replay with disappearing spells, could be a bug
 yhyoxx: i keep ending up with full inventory&#160;:/
 Michael_Howard: There's a setting to hide exhausted spells
 SujalAI: o
 SujalAI: oh
 SujalAI: oh yeah it was turned on
 aristotelis-bobas: why is silver league postponed?
 aristotelis-bobas: will there be new mechanics in silver league?
 Uljahn: no
 aristotelis-bobas: ok thnx
 Uljahn: silver opens in about 4 hours
 aristotelis-bobas: ah nice
 SujalAI: rmuskovets which path finding also are you using
 rmuskovets: depth first search
 SujalAI: kk
 rmuskovets: Uljahn so at ~14:30 +0?
 Uljahn: current time + 5-6 hours i guess
 Uljahn: 4 hours was a bit harsh estimation, sorry
 rmuskovets: now you say 5-6 hours... time keeps changing:)
 rmuskovets: np
 rmuskovets: it's just more time for us to get ready
 rmuskovets: SujalAI: how you're so high? I'm at 3189 now
 Uljahn: nobody knows the exact time, we can only extrapolate from the past experience :smiley:
 Michael_Howard: so it's not empty
 SujalAI: rmuskovets I'm not using any path finding algos, just basic strats
 Michael_Howard: oops lag
 SujalAI: I learn the spells of highest 'value' (determined by a heuristic)
 rmuskovets: that's what I used before too
 SujalAI: And I'm not really using any strat to cast spells
 SujalAI: I just brew any potion I can
 SujalAI: I also priortize casting spells with higher 'value'
 rmuskovets: I'll bring back my old strategy
 rmuskovets: it's better than what I currently do (learn every single recipe)
 rmuskovets: definitely better.
 LordSkaven: that moment when your bot breaks top 2000, but you have no idea why it works
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, did you break it?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 eulerscheZahl: i fixed it
 eulerscheZahl: performs better offline
 Illedan: An era of C# is over already?&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: before it even started
 Illedan: True
 Illedan: 7 days to learn C++, lets go!
 eulerscheZahl: resubmit of yesterday evening just to be sure
 wlesavo: it was good while it lasted
 rmuskovets: eulerscheZahl same
 rmuskovets: yesterday evening performs better than now
 rmuskovets: I was 3189, now I'm 2537
 rmuskovets: yesterday &gt; today
 LordSkaven: mmm, I just went from 2780 to 1690. No idea why my bot is even working lol
 Westicles: Is it ever a thing to see a low rank player at the top who always seems to lose to one particular guy?
 struct: I think its normal
 Illedan: Sure
 Westicles: I mean, would that kind of thing get you in trouble...
 struct: With such a big league no
 Snowite: hi
 Snowite: can someone help me with a problem&#160;?
 SujalAI: yes?
 eulerscheZahl: hm, back to 3rd with some battles left
 rmuskovets: my newest code was timeouting because of a console.error()
 rmuskovets: lol
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i did break something. or unlucky run
 Illedan: Fix it&#160;:)
 struct: Why do you think you broke something euler?
 struct: I wasnt here
 eulerscheZahl: i'll let it finish and then push the version again that i see superior
 eulerscheZahl: was 4th with my "improved" bot
 SujalAI: woah
 SujalAI: nice
 SujalAI: now you're second
 eulerscheZahl: my current one (first from yesterday) thinks i can cast the same spell again if i use it an even amount of times
 eulerscheZahl: and that nonsense is back to #2 atm
 yhyoxx: x) 
 struct: maybe unlucky submit
 eulerscheZahl: offline: 100 wins vs current bot, 69 losses, 38 draws
 struct: How does it perform in these seeds you have lost with the "fixed" version
 eulerscheZahl: i feel sorry for the CG servers but i'll submit again
 SujalAI: your rank dropped
 SujalAI: quite a bit
 Westicles: 38 draws seems surprising
 Illedan: Why?
 jrke: how does it feel when improved bot gets bad rank(the current feel of our legendary toad)&#160;;)
 Westicles: Hmmm, well I guess I haven't seen many in the wild, but probably related to not having a good bot
 eulerscheZahl: it's still me vs other me
 eulerscheZahl: not the same bot anymore but similar
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm almost deterministic (time makes me random)
 jrke: what you all think the opening window of silver would be?
 tobk: hm, why do I not see any "opponent-cast" in my actions list? shouldn't it list the opponent's known spells?
 tobk: (I wouldn't really know what to do with it, just wondering)
 yhyoxx: i think u do get the values
 tobk: oh, you are right. I did not notice the debug output being pruned ("..."), now printing just the types and there they are
 eulerscheZahl: i think i learned absolutely nothing from that submit&#160;:/
 jrke: just went 3rd from 2nd
 Westicles: You've got a Rounddice problem
 eulerscheZahl: i know :D
 SujalAI: I'm braindead now
 SujalAI: I have no ideas
 eulerscheZahl: and an empty stomach problem. but i know a cure for that one at least
 SujalAI: Can someone explain how depth first search can be used here?
 SujalAI: Because I don't know the whole graph already, I have to extend it as I go
 Q12: When the silver league is open? and which ranks from the bronze league will promote immediately? 
 yhyoxx: only 10 first sadly
 Q12: really?!?
 SujalAI: oh damn
 jrke: no no not top 10 it will be between  300-600 not confirmed
 Astrobytes: No, it's usually about half the leaeuge
 SujalAI: isn't it any program that can defeat the boss of that league?
 Astrobytes: *league
 jrke: Astrobytes hi
 Uljahn: first 10 is for legend
 Q12: thanks
 jrke: i think it was 10% for pacman
 yhyoxx: was kidding&#160;:'0
 Astrobytes: a Boss will be chosen by CG, everyone above it will auto-promote, everyone who beats it after will promote
 Q12: and when the bronze league will be open?
 Astrobytes: hi jrke
 Q12: *silver
 Uljahn: silver in 4+hours
 Astrobytes: ^
 Q12: :thumbsup:
 Astrobytes: It's done manually so the time can vary a little
 jrke: 5 hours from now 
 yhyoxx: if ur on the ide, click on the league next to the time left
 DinuBrat: Wood in 2 mins)
 DinuBrat: Uljahn Hi)
 DinuBrat: #ru
 Q12: &gt; yhyoxx it saying just the day
 SujalAI: I better get my rank above 600 before the league opens&#160;:/
 yhyoxx: u asked if the bronze league is open
 Q12: yeah I got confused, I am already in the bronze league :sweat_smile:
 SujalAI: It seems like basic strateies are working better than path finding algos
 SujalAI: weird
 Snowite: can someone help me with some constructors?
 SujalAI: yes?
 SujalAI: Snowite
 RockyMullet: hello nice people
 Astrobytes: hey Rocky
 RockyMullet: how you doing Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: all good, yourself?
 RockyMullet: yeah good good, slowly coding my sim
 Astrobytes: I'm gonna start writing something shortly, after another coffee
 RockyMullet: yeah good idea, I need one
 Nerchio: i will be trying C++ as well we will see if badly implemented sim is better than decent java sim :D
 yhyoxx: ive had so many coffees in the last 15 hours 
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol Nerchio, good luck :D
 yhyoxx: does language change something&#160;?
 yhyoxx: execution time&#160;?
 andrefpoliveira: Yap
 SujalAI: yes
 SujalAI: c++ is fast
 Nerchio: yeah the differences can be huge
 yhyoxx: interesting 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, C++ (and Rust) can give a performance boost if done properly
 yhyoxx: how can i do it properly&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Don't make it slow :P
 yhyoxx: haha true
 yhyoxx: for loop go brrrr
 RockyMullet: yeah performance with coffee is way better
 Astrobytes: :D
 ParticleBeam: Sigh. When you log on and see your bot dropped a few hundred slots
 rmuskovets: i really hope nodejs has some optimisations
 SujalAI: im still trying to figure out the optimal path to a potion. Can someone help me pls :cry:
 Nerchio: Particle it happens to almost every bot
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, every single time. and then you have to fight your way up again
 eulerscheZahl: the same every contest
 Q12: Are the battles in arena working?
 RockyMullet: yeah the things is noob like me rush a shitty bot in the first days to get top 10, then actually good programmers show up and shatter my dreams
 Astrobytes: "noob like me" :D
 RockyMullet: well im 236 with saturday bot rn, so nothing to write home about lol
 andrefpoliveira: I wish xD
 RockyMullet: should be good enough for silver, so it's time to waste time on the chat haha
 Q12: Are the battles in arena working? need to know before submit
 andrefpoliveira: Yeah they are
 Q12: thanks
 RockyMullet: well I'm actually coding my scoring for my sim, so I might have a bugged broken version soon
 eulerscheZahl: i share your rush problem RockyMullet
 eulerscheZahl: not to the same extent but on the last day or 2 i see that i messed up
 RockyMullet: eulerscheZahl I think I always get too excited in the early days of contests :P
 RockyMullet: going for instant gratification haha
 eulerscheZahl: i'm too much of a CG veteran for that now :D
 RockyMullet: yeah I'll never learn
 eulerscheZahl: no one is surprised anymore to see me at the top early on. so it's less gratification :P
 eulerscheZahl: so i build it properly and take 2 or 3 days to get to the top. and then fail because i rushed a little too much
 RockyMullet: well I'm like "that son of a b did it again&#160;!" lol
 AdrianGeorgeM: Hello dev friends✌️
 eulerscheZahl: see, you are not surprised :D
 RockyMullet: AdrianGeorgeM hello
 RockyMullet: eulerscheZahl true, you need to work on your sneakyness
 dauom: When will silver league be open?
 andrefpoliveira: 3h30 I guess
 dauom: thanks
 RockyMullet: based on previous contest, it should be in 5-7 hours from now
 eulerscheZahl: 5h 30min
 eulerscheZahl: 6pm SaiksyTime as the French users tend to day
 eulerscheZahl: say*
 RockyMullet: is Saiksy the one pushing the boss&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: [CG] Saiksy Apo
 RockyMullet: I should peak more in Fr, to know the memes
 eulerscheZahl: the tall, bald guy (johnnyYuge)
 Astrobytes: lol
 Nerchio: euler don't you think C# is going to limit you a little bit?
 eulerscheZahl: it does. but less than it used to (release mode + .net core have an impact)
 wlesavo: RIIR
 eulerscheZahl: and it also helps me (i just can code fater in C#)
 eulerscheZahl: MVVM (i have no idea what wlesavo says, just another palindrome)
 Astrobytes: Rewrite It In Rust I believe
 eulerscheZahl: accept defeat
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm not ready for that option yet
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 NicolasH_42: + for the Rust, its such a good language&#160;! I do this challenge to  learn itand its very good so far
 yhyoxx: why do we only see error streams when we're left player&#160;:/
 RockyMullet: yhyoxx you se your own error stream
 RockyMullet: so, there's a total of 66 rupees in the 5 potions of my test case and my sim tells me that my move gives me 204 rupees
 RockyMullet: my sim too good I guess
 RoundBananas: I don't understand the codingame learning path interface. 
 RoundBananas: How do I find the 'next' challenge to tackle?
 RockyMullet: the nodes with a little "play" icon on them
 RockyMullet: it's a challenge you didnt do yet
 RoundBananas: Thanks RockyMullet. I've done the intro. Then it gives me three options - AI, Clash of Code and Algorithms. I chose Algorithms and it just takes me to a page called Loops with a gallery of Associated Training Puzzles. There doesn't seem to be any path or order to the challenges?
 RockyMullet: oh and I have -13k of each ingredients, sooooooomething might be wrong in my code
 RoundBananas: Is Chrome browser fully supported?
 RockyMullet: RoundBananas hover your mouse over it
 RockyMullet: it's more like "achievements"
 RockyMullet: the tooltip will tell you want you need to do
 LordSkaven: RockyMullet, I dont know, maybe having -13k ingredients is the secret to winning. Not sure what you will win but definitely something
 RoundBananas: ok. I didn't read all that stuff in the tooltip - there it is on the last line. Cheers
 RockyMullet: LordSkaven yes, I'm thinking outside the box
 RockyMullet: RoundBananas have fun&#160;!&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: okay copying my sim data breaks it, giving me a broken inventory and broken rupee count :thinking:
 RockyMullet: gotta untangle that spaghetti
 RockyMullet: oh god im dumb
 RockyMullet: uninitialized variable
 RockyMullet: good, now my best move gives 0 rupee hahaha
 RockyMullet: progress&#160;!
 rmuskovets: :thumbsup:
 blasterpoard: I've been trying to create good move generation for my search
 blasterpoard: if I always play the first move it suggests, it looks like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/503125889">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/503125889</a>
 blasterpoard: for now
 yhyoxx: looks good to me x)
 blasterpoard: it's ok for having absolutely no search other than 1ms precalc every time I learn a spell
 aCat: OK, repeteable casts done&#160;:-)
 LordSkaven: nice, I am still thinking how I want to approach them
 aCat: bleh, I got bunch of nested ifs
 aCat: and additional bits to store the info about the number of repetitions done
 Remus_: anyone else with random outcomes?Sometimes I win by 50 points then in another seed my bot does nothing for 40 rounds
 RockyMullet: Remus_ take a look at your learn code
 RockyMullet: maybe you learn too many spells without checking if their any good
 RockyMullet: making it way more random than choosing
 RockyMullet: one seed you might be lucky and pick good spells, while in another one, bad ones
 LordSkaven: booyah, Top 700 now.(650) Pretty happy with that, started 6 hours ago in Top 3000.
 yhyoxx: good job
 Csipcsirip: you gotta need to win all of first 30 games to get in top50...this huge bronze league is no fun
 Remus_: RockyMullet, thanks for the tip, will do
 Presac: I'm just happy being in the top 2000. Still haven't figured out how to handle learning spells and updating the value of spells/ingredients
 RockyMullet: :thumbsup:
 RockyMullet: Csipcsirip silver is out soon (couple of hours), it's probably better to hold submits until then
 yhyoxx: good advice
 Csipcsirip: but i need to submit&#160;:(
 RockyMullet: I mean, if you have a "good enough for silver" bot
 eulerscheZahl: you can reach top50 with 1 or 2 timeouts as well
 RockyMullet: i'd say top 1000 is probably good enough
 eulerscheZahl: and then it's server stress test time again
 wlesavo: yeah, it is probably better to wait couple of hours now than couple of hours after the league will be opened
 Csipcsirip: and the wait another 3 days cuz silver league wil lbe huge too
 RockyMullet: Csipcsirip well maybe you can submit once during that time :P
 Stanworld: you can reach top800 with a bot without considering  the opponent actions...(or considering he "waits" always)
 eulerscheZahl: you can reach top5 without opponent
 eulerscheZahl: at least for now. will change during the contest
 namenick111: heloo
 namenick111: hello
 Neumann: top5 without even looking at how many pots he has completed&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: on my todo
 Neumann: Interestring
 Neumann: Interesting*
 eulerscheZahl: but i know my own completion count
 Neumann: So you do look at his score, at least
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Stanworld: top5 without guessing opponent moves... impressive
 struct: STC
 eulerscheZahl: i rush to complete the 6th when doing so is a definite loss even
 eulerscheZahl: so i know what to improve at least
 AbsentMoon: If I want to learn the 6th spell and there is already tax placed under the previous 5 spells, can I learn that 6th spell for free or do I need to place new tax?
 struct: no
 AbsentMoon: So I need to place new tax?
 eulerscheZahl: :100:
 AbsentMoon: So just to be clear. You have to place new tax every time you want to learn a spell. Correct?
 struct: yes if its above index 0 
 AbsentMoon: Okay. Thank you.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/711887567590654013/777672969127723008/W5EydYr.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/711887567590654013/777672969127723008/W5EydYr.png</a>
 AbsentMoon: lol
 AbsentMoon: Is that normal for you lol
 eulerscheZahl: no, someone shared it on discord
 AbsentMoon: Oh lol
 anoburn: I'm a bit confused. Every time I submit, my bot times out in the first round
 anoburn: Following matches work fine (occasional timeout), but first match is ALWAYS a timeout
 Stanworld: is there any moment that casting a spell repeatable more  11 times (or more&#160;?) can be valid&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: 5 is the max
 Stanworld: ho... i didn'd know that
 AbsentMoon: Are all the spell that give resources for no inventory charge non-repeatable?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 AbsentMoon: I figured.
 struct: My code was bugging everywhere
 struct: It breaks if I had 6 recipes instead of 5
 struct: add*
 xSkyline: the game code including all the possible spells is available on github:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java</a>
 pedrosorio: is there an example on how to use the referee code in github to play the game locally?
 MadKnight: u wanna play against whom&#160;?
 Neumann: eulerscheZahl: the number of nodes you display is before or after the removal of duplicates&#160;?
 pedrosorio: @MadKnight I want to be able to play different versions of my bot against each other
 adouz: what time the silver will be open guys?
 MadKnight: u probably need to run it from the console
 xSkyline: not sure it's worth it to run locally but you can probably do it by reading the documentation<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/game-runner">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/game-runner</a>
 MadKnight: probably in 2h adouz
 adouz: MadKnight thanks
 eulerscheZahl: before @Neumann
 eulerscheZahl: i know, it's low
 MadKnight: pedrosorio don't get your bot overtrained against your strategy making him play worse against other strategies
 pedrosorio: @xSkyline thanks for the link!
 MadKnight: sometimes it can go a bit weird when your bot will play very well against your previous best but worse against everyone else
 anoburn: Yeah yeah Euler, flex with your numbers while I'm stuck at 7000 nodes :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: blaster mentioned 150k
 anoburn: woah
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm pretty sure Neumann has more than me as well
 pedrosorio: thanks for the tip madknight, I understand the issue with  overfitting, and while the web interface is nice, I want the ability to iterate and test faster locally
 MadKnight: but how are u gonna avoid overfitting&#160;?
 pedrosorio: how do you avoid overfitting with the web interface?
 MadKnight: by playing against multiple different players
 MadKnight: who use different strategies
 pedrosorio: manually pick 30 different opponents by hand?
 Neumann: eulerscheZahl: Even then it's pretty high for C#
 Neumann: How much the typical perf ratio C#/C++ is&#160;?
 MadKnight: usually like 10-15 players in range of some rank
 pedrosorio: I can do the manual work after iterating locally with 500 automatically generated versions of my  own bot with different parameters
 MadKnight: that's still the same strategy
 MadKnight: it won't generate major differences
 eulerscheZahl: used to be factor 2-3 when i converted my UTTT. but now we have release mode and .net core
 Neumann: Oh, I though it was higher
 eulerscheZahl: i would guess factor 1.5 maybe
 MadKnight: but still a lot better than 1 opponent
 eulerscheZahl: i mean 0.66 as you asked for C#/C++ not C++/C# :P
 Neumann: I have 180/190k simulated moves (that means less nodes since a lot of them are duplicate)
 LordSkaven: just realized that in my repeatable cast implemation I always returned 0 times cast amount if it was repeatable lol
 eulerscheZahl: my 60k is with duplicates too
 eulerscheZahl: so you are higher than me for sure
 eulerscheZahl: at least i have a bitboard this time
 eulerscheZahl: felt like a must-have
 pedrosorio: Madknight, the same code with different parameters (branch factor, heuristic, etc.) can generate wildly different strategies. I am not saying I will iterate locally and then submit the best bot blindly. 
 Neumann: Uh&#160;? For inventory&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Neumann: I don't and don't feel like it's worth the saved memory
 eulerscheZahl: it's about speed
 MadKnight: yea it might be good enough pedrosorio, try it
 eulerscheZahl: except if you have a lookup table for inventory transitions
 eulerscheZahl: keeping it as an array and looping was slow for me
 eulerscheZahl: and copying the array especially
 Neumann: You managed to cast/brew in a single operation with bitboard&#160;? How do you handle negative numbers&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: 2's complement
 MadKnight: or u could run it on GPU and get a ton of games running at the same time pedrosorio
 pedrosorio: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i can cast/brew with a single add, yes. then an AND to remove overflows
 Neumann: Hum, will look into that
 Counterbalance: you can get far more sims than that
 Counterbalance: i'm getting about 40k sims per ms
 eulerscheZahl: but you don't use them to your advantage :D
 eulerscheZahl: just trolling
 Counterbalance: nope, that's the tricky part&#160;:)
 MadKnight: what exactly are u simming Counterbalance&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i spent the whole morning refactoring and then it was slower
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MadKnight: just the spell usage&#160;?
 Counterbalance: casting spells and rest
 eulerscheZahl: and brewing
 kovi: how many spells?
 Counterbalance: yeah.. i collect the solutions for the brews
 Counterbalance: 14 spells
 eulerscheZahl: i don't understand the question
 Counterbalance: I have no idea how you'd do a cast/brew with 1 add and 1 and though, that's pure magic
 eulerscheZahl: i'll tell you after the contest, that's the only remotely clever thing in my bot :D
 Counterbalance: okay&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: if you have no carry, you can add four chars contained in an int
 eulerscheZahl: but we still need a 5th, the total
 <b>**eulerscheZahl does that too</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: and thanks to dreadylein i learned that C# has a PopCount now
 Zenoscave: numerics eh?
 Zenoscave: dreadylein reached out to you too&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Zenoscave: That's 1 of the 2 todos for today
 eulerscheZahl: he loves speed tuning with managed code
 CommanderCero: Furiosly writing down everything eulerscheZahl mentiones
 eulerscheZahl: let me guess: he also told you about vector using AVX behind the scenes?
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: My biggest bug is switching between different outcomes turn to turn. my search isn't stable
 eulerscheZahl: mine is when i set a fixed sim count
 Zenoscave: interesting
 Zenoscave: I'll have to try that
 Zenoscave: but need the big sims first
 eulerscheZahl: you are already above toad level, aren't you?&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i always struggle with these speed contests
 Zenoscave: I was earlier.
 Zenoscave: No lookup table yet
 jacek: good afternoon
 jacek: when silver
 LordSkaven: like 50 minutes to 2 hours
 karliso: There is no brutaltester compatible referee on github?!
 JRFerguson: hi all
 JRFerguson: anyone has any good tips on how to debug memory access violation errors in c++&#160;?
 JRFerguson: my bot is crushing randomly, aparently due to that
 Counterbalance: run offline in valgrind or in an IDE
 JRFerguson: when i test locally in visual studio it works just fine
 JRFerguson: there must be some difference in memory handling between my local environment and CG
 Counterbalance: you could compile with gcc -Wall which prints some warnings that VS does not
 JRFerguson: will try that
 JRFerguson: thx
 JRFerguson: i'm getting this warning
 JRFerguson: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur
 JRFerguson: i'm not sure what it means
 Jdools05: basically your providing outputs before the game as provided all the inputs
 Jdools05: it is not expecting your outputs so you may need to check all your input variables
 JRFerguson: did the inputs changed&#160;?
 Counterbalance: hm yeah i'm getting crashes in the arena now - unknown spell
 JRFerguson: maybe outputs to error console are considered for the warning&#160;?
 Counterbalance: maybe your bot crashed before reading all inputs
 Jdools05: well there are a lot of inputs to handle. for each action you have: id, type, delta 0-3, price, tome_index, tax, castable, repeatable
 Jdools05: and then inventory 0-3 and score for both you and your opponent
 Jdools05: id just make sure you are receiving all those inputs before sending an output
 Jdools05: @JRFerguson I hope that helped out your issue, otherwise I have no clue
 Xmaster6: It's more likely to be performance issue, like if your bot is too slow the output at a given turn will be taken into account only at the next one and thus create dis-synchronization... 
 Bzn0r-Karloid: could someone confirm that: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7b7aefc3-8523-4bbd-abe4-b0c9890624be">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7b7aefc3-8523-4bbd-abe4-b0c9890624be</a>
 Bzn0r-Karloid: could someone confirm that: swift locally on macos works 10 times faster than on codingame runtime? Did anyone have this kind of issues? or it works fine for everyone else? my local cpu 9700k, same strategy on kotlin shows kind of same performance both for local and codingame run
 [K]Gabor: @JRFerguson has it stopped with a timeout? everytime my bot times out, it gives me that warning
 mandersn: JRFerguson - Are you trying to do any debugging output?  I've seen that error when I accidentally send my debug to STDOUT instead of STDERR.
 eulerscheZahl: god dammit. 4 losses in that submit so far. all timeouts
 Counterbalance: do you have a list of all spells in your bot, eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: why should i? CG is kind enough to give them to me
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/503280035">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/503280035</a>that match had some outliners in the timing before
 eulerscheZahl: and other 3 are just in the first turn
 eulerscheZahl: seems fine offline
 eulerscheZahl: *sends to CG IDE*
 eulerscheZahl: and wins the game
 JBence: same here euler
 Westicles: How many spells did they add?
 JBence: random timeouts
 eulerscheZahl: i had 1 vs you JBence. you are the one who got sent in my IDE
 Eclipse_Storm: When does Silver League open?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/503283405">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/503283405</a>take that, kill in 31 turns :P
 ntroPi: Within the next hour
 JBence: ouch
 JBence: there's plenty of room to improve
 VizGhar: holy shit euler take some sleep :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/503285880">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/503285880</a>pb with a timeout too
 JBence: so is it not our fault?
 eulerscheZahl: unlikely
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i did submit a new version with some changes. but that all of us break our bots at the same time?
 JRFerguson: euler, you also timeouting in ide some times&#160;?
 pb4: New spells
 mlomb: ETA till silver open?
 eulerscheZahl: didn't test
 pb4: I timeout if I don't recognize the spell
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 Remus_: New spells?
 ntroPi: 1h
 Icebox: what
 pb4: As for "normal" timeouts, I get the 1% of games
 Counterbalance: same here, they fixed 1 spell
 Icebox: god damn it
 JBence: I'm not getting timeouts in IDE with 45ms and getting them in arena with 30ms
 Icebox: how many "fixes" are there gonna be
 eulerscheZahl: i won't even ask why you hardcoded them. afk
 Cappefra: what time is silver opening?
 pb4: Couterbalance&#160;: only one&#160;?
 Majeck: 1 hour I think
 pb4: Which one&#160;? I'll just fix it by hand if it's only one
 Counterbalance: I've asked on discord, waiting for an answer..
 Michael_Howard: We need a dedicated "When does silver open" chat channel
 Remus_: deck has not been changed, I wish they'd update that too...
 Telokis: An error was reported regardin spell 69 on the forum, it may be that one
 tempux: NICE
 Csipcsirip: nice idd
 Telokis: I don't remember the precise message but the main post states "potion 69 is wrong" under "Current bugs". It may have been fixed, idk
 Counterbalance: they said that that one was okay.I'ts most likely the (-1, 0, -1, 1) that got changed to (-1, -1, 0, 1)
 Cappefra: my goood I'm the noobest of all noobs. I was getting timeouts that seemed random af even after dropping the time limit for the main search down do 35 ms and then I saw I was checking for the timer to be == 35 instead of &gt;= 35 :sweat_smile:
 VizGhar: :D nice one
 Cappefra: running fine with &gt;=48 now :D
 kovi: -1, 0, -1, 1
 kovi: chat delay sorry
 Cappefra: word kovi, word
 Beresta: wait a second, so there are only 36 possible brews
 ClockSort: Cappafra, &gt;=48ms? What's your secret?
 Beresta: each with predefined cost
 Cappefra: @Clocksort I don't do almost anything after that algo, a couple quick decision checks that will never take more than 1 ms, then I print the output
 Counterbalance: ok +2500 ranks with that spell fix so it seems to be the one
 Remus_: maybe, but cost is calculated from the recipe so they could add some more
 ClockSort: @cappefra what language?
 Cappefra: C#
 AbsentMoon: What method are you all using for choosing what potion to make? I am doing it by price, but I am wondering if it would be better to do it in terms of efficiency (rupees/steps)
 Cappefra: @ClockSort going by our ranks doesn't seem like you have anything to learn from me though&#160;:)
 ClockSort: sweet. i iterate over thousands of states afterwards so i'm stopping at 42ms
 VizGhar: if you can make cheaper potion by 2 rupees but 1-2 moves sooner, you should pick the cheaper one (if you are looking only for a single brew)
 Beresta: well it could lead you to losing game easily, if you are few points away from winning
 daffie: finally found the secret sauce
 NoobCod3: anybody wanna be friends?
 NoobCod3: IM SO LONELY:(
 cegprakash: when is silver opening
 MattSOrme: sometime in the next hour?
 NoobCod3: I have no friends&#160;:(
 MattSOrme: Its manual. So whenever CG can pick a suitable boss
 NoobCod3: :cry:
 Stanworld: there is no friends,...only interfaces...
 Hamyzo: How many usually go automatically up to the next league when it opens?
 MattSOrme: I've heard as many as top 50%. But they've never had this many people in bronze before i dont think lol
 Cappefra: @hamyzo usually like 30-40% of bronze but last contest was like 15% because of how crowded it was
 Cappefra: this time it's also as crowded iirc
 ClockSort: @cappefra how many states do you search in 48ms?
 jrke: 200/1800 was in spring challenge silver opening
 MattSOrme: we have over 3500 in bronze this time lol
 Hamyzo: Hmm so many opinions, guess we'll know when it happens then
 Cappefra: @ClockSort that is a really good question! Let me see
 MattSOrme: Hopefully top 1200&#160;;) 
 VizGhar: Hmm if I know every single possible LEARN, BREW and CAST... I can simply make complete decision tree right? :D
 jrke: ok everyone lets make a guesss how many will be automatically promoted to silver
 Donotalo: top 50% won't advance to silver, right?
 Remus_: 200
 ClockSort: you can see my states if you look at my bot, it's simple bfs
 Donotalo: top X% will advance, what's X?
 MattSOrme: 200 is too aggressive. Bots at that level are too good for bronze
 jrke: in think 12-18%
 Remus_: DEFAULT would stay in Bronze right?
 Telokis: Is the boss picked from one of the contestants? Or is it handcrafted by CG?
 jrke: defaulr will be replaced by boss
 MattSOrme: picked from contestants, and maybe tweaked
 Westicles: I think I will be boss.  Nice and deterministic, around 500
 jrke: telokis one of contestants
 Remus_: I hope it won't get much stronger then :D
 Telokis: Thanks, that's an interesting way of doing it
 DeWitt: hm, is the repeatability of the same potions always the same?
 MattSOrme: yes. Only learned tomes with a cost are repeatable
 jrke: why i made a resubmit&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: why not?
 Remus_: Will they change the bot's though? If bot from like 1000th place becomes the Boss, in a few days lot's of people will get past again if it stays the same
 DeWitt: wdym by learned?
 DeWitt: i mean, is the spell +2 0 0 0 always not repeatable?
 MattSOrme: @Remus_ thats kinda the point?
 Remus_: I don't think it is, but this is my first challenge so idk
 eulerscheZahl: they'll just bot another boss above on wednesday
 eulerscheZahl: and one more on friday
 MattSOrme: bronze boss isn't meant to be gold boss lol. Can't just go straight to a top bot
 rmuskovets: well in bronze rules they say this is the final (no more rule unlocks)
 rmuskovets: so maybe "just go straight to a top bot" is possible
 eulerscheZahl: just harder bosses
 Q12: If my rank is 700 what is the chance I will be in silver? should I risk submit my new bot with the hope he will be better than my current bot?
 reCurse: Fairly high but no one knows
 Cappefra: I think 700 is a good chance of being promoted
 Q12: ok thanks
 Q12: I hope my rank will be enough for silver  :slight_smile:
 AbsentMoon: The game ends after 6 potions. If I were to speed brew 6 potions that are cheap, if my score is higher than my opponents score I would win. Would this be a viable strategy or would it barely ever work?
 Cappefra: it doesn't matter anyways if you submit or not, if you revert to a bot that would have been promoted to silver directly, that bot will be able to beat the bronze boss
 Remus_: It's not a problem if we don't get it now. At least we will know that to beat
 Cappefra: @AbsentMoon it can be viable maybe after 3 or 4 good value potions, if you brew 5 very cheap ones just to be fast there's a good change your opponent will be able to brew 3 good value ones and still have you beat
 AbsentMoon: I figured lol. I might try a variation of it later. 
 AbsentMoon: This is probably a silly question, but are the prices for each potion always the same (not including bonuses).
 Remus_: yes
 BoBot: damn, this discussion made me realize you do not win just by getting to 6 potions faster - I thought speed vs rupees were 2 different strategies...
 rmuskovets: how to run this challenge offline?
 daffie: rates are not necessarily the same if you factor in the number of turns spent on casting
 BoBot: @AbsentMoon all spells are listed here I think:
 ayoubyt: 1337
 NoobCod3: anybody wanna be my friend?
 jrke: 1337?
 eulerscheZahl: leet
 Neteroo: 0k3y
 Myrky: Should I be proud that my solution got 100% or ashamed that is not optimal?
 AntonCosmin: I wanna be your friend NoobCod3
 Zenoscave: no silver yet? I thought it would be ready by now
 linjoehan: I won't make it to silver yet anyway I'm just gonna stay down here maybe then the boss might be an easier one?
 ErikBrendel: yeah I am also wondering when the silver league comes...
 Cappefra: I hate this... I make a change that wins like 90% against my own submitted bot, I submit and I lose 450 positions
 Cappefra: wtf
 Beresta: thats overfitting to one specific opponent 
 Cappefra: yeah...
 jrke: Cappefra randomness and winning against one doesn't mean a better bot
 Cappefra: learning the hard lesson
 Counterbalance: also the leaderboard gets more volatile further down.. if you have timeouts, it's basically impossible to tell anything
 LordSkaven: can you be demoted from league? Like from silver to bronze?
 arkwaw: no
 Remus_: yey
 linjoehan: maybe that should be a thing though
 DomiKo: here we go
 tempux: PogChamp silver coming soon
 Stanworld:&#160;:)
 Icebox: jesus no linjoehan, imagine you submit a code with a typo that times out and doesn't compile just to drop a league
 Icebox: I don't think you want that
 Zenoscave: Yeah I'd be furious if I had to do gold to legend twice in UTTT
 eulerscheZahl: bossyboss where are you?
 Zenoscave: I got the silver soon notificatin
 eulerscheZahl: 1.5kother bets?
 ntroPi: But having the previous league bosses in the higher leagues would be fun as a comparison point.
 Icebox: 1.2k
 Zenoscave: 1.35k
 ntroPi: 900
 Zenoscave: I averaged
 Michael_Howard: 228 (I'm at 229)
 Samer: is it possible in a game to see a tome spell that's not in the deck??
 Zenoscave: silver opening is never that restrictive
 Zenoscave: Samer no the tome's are detirministic
 RockyMullet: oh
 RockyMullet: silver
 CommanderCero: silver boys
 DaNinja: ding
 qsantos: 867
 allahoAkbar: oh yeah
 Beresta: 867
 Icebox: 867 
 ClockSort: woot i'm in silver
 struct: Nice no resubmit
 Icebox: ntroPi wons
 Nerchio: i made it
 struct: so it saves server
 RockyMullet: yeah, a couple will drift for sure
 DomiKo: no resbmit?
 DomiKo: nice save CG
 Michael_Howard: :second_place:
 Remus_: so about 800 was the cut
 LordSkaven: yippe I am in silver!
 Nerchio: so who was 868 before resubmit = boss? :D
 linjoehan: goodbye my friends I will see you there later I hope :tired_face:
 ErikBrendel: "woot i'm in silver" - yes, feeling the same over here :D
 Cappefra: fuuuuuuuck I was 750 before my shitty resubmit
 _martynas: Is there anything new in silver league?
 Michael_Howard: Wow only 867
 RockyMullet: oh they made it so we dont resubmit, good idea tbh
 DeWitt: Players gain 1 rupee for each tier-1 ingredient or higher in their inventory.
 ntroPi: IceBox thx, yay.&#160;:-)
 Zenoscave: _martynas no
 xSkyline: are there no actual game changes in Silver&#160;?
 linjoehan: DeWitt that's at the end of the game I think
 Donotalo: 867 people in siler
 RockyMullet: Michael_Howard it's pretty likely a lot of people will drift or pass with a resubmit, I'm getting it will climb to at less 1200 soon
 DomiKo: in bronze there are final rules
 DomiKo: no new rules in silver
 RockyMullet: xSkyline no, just bigger boi league
 Zenoscave: xSkyline the only thing that changes in silver is the opponent meta&#160;;)
 DerthekNagra: when will gold come out? :D
 xSkyline: thanks guys
 RockyMullet: 2 days from now
 Icebox: in 2 days exactly DerthekNagra
 pb4: Was the a recompute in Silver&#160;?
 DerthekNagra: ty
 struct: no pb4
 pb4: was there*
 Icebox: no pb4
 Zenoscave: nope
 Zenoscave: pb4
 DeWitt: nope
 pb4: Ok
 Zenoscave: lol everyone all together now
 RockyMullet: let those poor servers breath
 xSkyline: my first coding game, I'm 460ish
 Icebox: chat gigga laggy for me Zenoscave
 Remus_: VincentBab is the boss
 Zenoscave: same
 Zenoscave: Seriously remus? He was 6th yesterday
 VincentBab: lool
 Zenoscave: VincentBab what happened?
 VincentBab: i dont know&#160;:/i was in the top#10 and was not promoted directly lol
 Zenoscave: ouch
 MadKnight: VincentBab were u submitting&#160;?
 wlesavo: VincentBab probably was computing
 MadKnight: was it not 100%&#160;?
 VincentBab: nope, last submit this morning
 MadKnight: random bug
 ntroPi: more coming in, almost at 1k now
 MadKnight: hey Zenoscave how's your search&#160;?
 Zenoscave: Pretty good. slow but steady
 Zenoscave: Hey MK
 RockyMullet: already at 981, didnt take long
 DerthekNagra: is it possible to have a thread calculating stuff outside of the game loop here?
 pedrosorio: what's the point of the leagues if the rules remain the same?
 RockyMullet: no
 raymoo: in two more days
 raymoo: oh I was scrolled up
 RockyMullet: no multithreading
 kovi: no recalc just warp?
 DerthekNagra: ty
 spaceorc: Why list of available spells is changing in repo? When it will stabilize? I encode spell as index from that list!
 Icebox: pedrosorio clear tracking of progress
 RockyMullet: my guess would be that they already use their threads to run multiple games at the same time
 Grudo: how doeas this new rule works? I don't see a difference
 BrunoFelthes: @DerthekNagra you can use multi thread, but you have only one proecessor
 RockyMullet: Grudo no new rules, just harder opponents
 Icebox: just cause you remain 10th doesn't mean that your bot didn't improve pedrosorio, everyone is improving their bots so you might not feel like progressing. if you have a bot above you though, you can always clearly see if you're performing better or not because the bot doesn't improve
 Grudo: RockyMullet "Players gain 1 rupee for each tier-1 ingredient or higher in their inventory."
 Icebox: this was always the case Grudo
 Zenoscave: Grudo that was already a rule
 RockyMullet: thats not new
 Grudo: oh so i missed it :F
 pedrosorio: @icebox makes sense - how can you tell who is the boss in the bronze league?
 RockyMullet: but to answer the question, at the end of the game, you get one point for all ingredients except the blue ones, in your inventory
 Redstrike: @spaceorc thanks for pointing that out. I was really confused why I get errors now
 RockyMullet: pedrosorio we can guess :P
 Icebox: well the boss bot is the bot ranked at #1
 RockyMullet: generally with what language, who was around that position, sometimes algos are easy to compare too
 Icebox: because everyone above him get instantly promoted
 dauom: I've seen in Bronze that "all rules unlocked", does that mean from that point onward nothing will change, only how strong your bot?
 RockyMullet: dauom exactly
 dauom: from that league onward*
 dauom: Thanks
 RockyMullet: so you dont have to deal with thousands of bots, crushing most of them
 spaceorc: hm, not only tome spells, but delivery spells are also different!
 RockyMullet: so you can tweak you bot to deal with better opponents
 RockyMullet: also no as long to submit
 Remus_: why does this happen to me lol<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/503356206">https://www.codingame.com/replay/503356206</a>
 LordSkaven: lol
 RockyMullet: hum seems like my old replay is broken
 Remus_: no possible actions left I think
 RockyMullet: they must have changed something
 reCurse: They changed (fixed) a spell
 reCurse: Broke all old replays
 reCurse: And a few bots
 RockyMullet: kk makes sense
 RockyMullet: what spell btw&#160;?
 RockyMullet: what was wrong with it
 RockyMullet: kind of wanna know if it breaks my bot :P
 Redstrike: fromnew Recipe(-1, 0, -1, 1)tonew Recipe(-1, -1, 0, 1)
 RockyMullet: oh they just tweaked the values
 RockyMullet: tnx
 jacek: w00t? im silver
 RockyMullet: wow I never add rupees in my sim...
 RockyMullet: I was wondering why my sim would always give me 0 rupee
 AntiSquid: always feels strange to see recurze in chat but not on the LB, Automaton2000 how do you feel about it?
 Automaton2000: but there are many ways to do so
 jacek: LB?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/8374201b6f1d19eb99d61c80351465b65150051">https://www.codingame.com/profile/8374201b6f1d19eb99d61c80351465b65150051</a>i have a badge now :D
 jacek: AutomatonNN what is LB?
 AutomatonNN: go there to make a general problem
 jacek: thats only participation badge
 jacek: nothing to brag about
 RockyMullet: whats that project euler thing&#160;?
 reCurse: leaderboard I guess
 eulerscheZahl: project euler = maths puzzles
 AntiSquid: ^ yes
 RockyMullet: well I dont have one&#160;:'(
 reCurse: fwiw I was active in chat in previous contests I didn't participate in
 reCurse: That's when it's the most interesting to be around so
 AntiSquid: what do i need to do to get the participation badge
 RockyMullet: I want to be "special" too
 AntiSquid: as i said, it always feels strange, not just this time :P
 eulerscheZahl: open your email client AntiSquid
 reCurse: Ahh ok
 eulerscheZahl: and poor reCurse has no badge now?
 reCurse: That's um...
 aCat: why this badge has nothing in common with the contest?
 reCurse: eh, when you have nothing nice to say...
 aCat: there is some other fall challenge this cat known nothing about?
 RockyMullet: see what those badges are doing&#160;!?!?!?!
 eulerscheZahl: the fall down the stairs challenge?
 Astrobytes: there are only Spring and Fall challenges now I guess
 AntiSquid: i find the badge is a bit huge, imagine having one for each contest 
 reCurse: Imagine having a badge for clicking a button
 reCurse: Damnit
 eulerscheZahl: or "certificates"
 AntiSquid: i submitted a basic bot too&#160;!
 jacek: or quests in quest map
 RockyMullet: I guess I'm too dumb to click that button, still dont have it lol
 AntiSquid: disqualified&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: didn't you get an email?
 RockyMullet: yah
 Q12: Why can't I put the image of the budget in my profile?
 Astrobytes: You overspent :P
 Astrobytes: (sorry)
 MeSeet: what are the requirement to pass to the next league (I'm wood 1 but I do not go to the next one even tho I  win more than 95% of my fights
 Astrobytes: badge, not budget Q12&#160;;)
 rmuskovets: MeSeet you need to be above the boss of your league
 Q12: my mistake :joy:
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: i don't see the badge on my profile though 
 Q12: at least I got into silver, that the only thing I matter :grinning:
 AntiSquid: and i clicked the bloody link
 MeSeet: hum, for a while I was above (3 position, but also nothing, I have to stay there for a long time?
 Q12: *that
 RockyMullet: I guess euler is the only who participates
 eulerscheZahl: just enter this to insert it q12
 RockyMullet: Am I even real&#160;?
 Quidome: MeSeet, you have to be above the boss after total recompute
 MeSeet: ahhhhh ok... I see&#160;:) I need to be patient and wait then. Thanks for info Quidome
 RockyMullet: oh im specila now&#160;!!!
 dbf: silver league was without resubmit?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbf: cool
 Q12: Thanks eulerscheZahl, it worked
 RockyMullet: eulerscheZahl I though it was a new feature. You were trolling us lol
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;? i just inserted the image from the email they sent us
 eulerscheZahl: no trolling intended
 RockyMullet: yeah I just misunderstood
 eulerscheZahl: that's a wide badge q12 :D
 Q12: refresh the page :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: better
 SinOfWrath: First time I got auto promoted on league opening. Was worth being up until 2am over the weekend. :D
 struct: Maybe thats what Im missing
 AntiSquid: damn it still not there&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: where?
 AntiSquid: on my profile
 Earthborne: Will taxCount &gt;= tomeIndex if enough tax-ahead is paid?
 reCurse: Very successful troll
 eulerscheZahl: thanks&#160;:)
 struct: Are the avatars in chat not loading for anyone else?
 RockyMullet: my sim still not brewing a single potion lol<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/503380569">https://www.codingame.com/replay/503380569</a>
 lowzhao: if you submit in silver will you go down to bronze?
 struct: no
 lowzhao: ok thanks!
 sadakatsu: I tried implementing a simulation yesterday.  It times out every time.  Are there any general tips on how to search the move space quicker than BFS since that is apparently doomed to fail?
 RockyMullet: well you gotta have a time check to stop before you time out
 lowzhao: not really you should have got something able to brew before you fail.
 <b>**Astrobytes makes a mental note to never use a timer again</b></p><p><img src="/a/53651363687730" /> sadakatsu: I have not been able to figure out a distance heuristic to potions, so I haven't been able to figure out a way to estimate an action's value unless the search stumbles upon a brew action  : /
 RockyMullet: well you gotta stop so you can output something...
 Earthborne: Why Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Earthborne, see the comment(s)  just before mine
 Earthborne: Oh, heh, sry
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 raymoo: is there a reference for what compiler flags are used for a particular language
 BrunoFelthes: run a ps - ef than you can see it
 AntiSquid: lol thought i had to resub for the stupid badge, forgot i need to edit that shit -.-
 Earthborne: I didn't really catch what's wrong with timer though
 raymoo: thanks bruno
 AntiSquid: then i'll add a better badge
 ProMikeSundays: do you have tips for getting to the solution faster
 Eclipse_Storm: Oh no new rules in Silver?
 Earthborne: Helped me search further without timing out (no matter the processing power I get)
 sadakatsu: listening intently
 kreska: i dont see anything new
 Astrobytes: was a joke Earthborne, the previous guy said "not really ... " after Rocky suggested the timer
 kreska: it should be in green right?
 Earthborne: oh.. right
 sadakatsu: The code repo and the E-mail that was sent out say that Bronze and up use the same rules.
 RockyMullet: finally&#160;! my sim outputing potions<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/503392186">https://www.codingame.com/replay/503392186</a>
 RockyMullet: it still lose to my old bot, most likely because I dont handle multicast yet
 eulerscheZahl: you learn a lot
 lowzhao: how to compete with yourself?
 tobk: somehow the Kotlin language assist is not consistent with the installed version of Kotlin itself...
 eulerscheZahl: delete the default
 eulerscheZahl: then add someone else
 eulerscheZahl: tobk =&gt; forum or discord bugs channel
 lowzhao: oh thank you for the tips!
 raymoo: @BrunoFelthes this just gives me the flags for the running program, am I doing this right?
 raymoo: I am trying to get the compiler flags
 eulerscheZahl: and give a minimum example where it's wrong maybe
 kreska: RockyMullet how do you do it? is there a way to play on site with different versions of your own bot?
 RockyMullet: you can play against your submitted bot
 RockyMullet: on the bottom there's "IDE CODE" then another player
 RockyMullet: press delete on the other player
 RockyMullet: then the +
 RockyMullet: you can pick yourself "arena code"
 kreska: RockyMullet and when i delete default bot will i be able to pick it again?
 RockyMullet: yes
 LordSkaven: yes
 RockyMullet: you can after rpess on a + sign and you'll have a picker with all available bots
 raymoo: Anyone else have any suggestions on how I might know what flags are given to the compiler
 RockyMullet: I'd say the forum is your best bet raymoo
 raymoo: ok, thanks
 RockyMullet: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum">https://www.codingame.com/forum</a>
 kreska: RockyMullet thanks for info i appreciate it!
 jacek: so for bronze bot they chose 1000nd player?
 jacek: boss*
 sadakatsu: I removed learning from my bot's options, and the sims are fast enough now  orz
 sadakatsu: I don't win, but I can compete.
 CodingCarter: What bot game are you playing @sadakatsu&#160;?
 sadakatsu: The Fall Challenge 2020.
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020</a>
 sadakatsu: LEARN is an action.  I dropped that from the choices I search, and now my bot finds a path to a potion within 50 ms.
 CodingCarter: Thanks for the link astro and thanks for ref sadakatsu
 Astrobytes: np&#160;:+1:
 sadakatsu: Is the same seed being used across these battles?  My replays are showing the same matches repeatedly when I replay opponents.
 struct: if you press replay in same conditions it will repeat the same seed
 sadakatsu: I clicked "Test in Arena".  I'm seeing identical matches over and over.
 struct: press options
 struct: and check if seed is not manual
 eulerscheZahl: he's talking about the lat battles viewer
 Grudo: these are replays
 eulerscheZahl: showing the same few while not showing others
 eulerscheZahl: i know that, annoys me too every time
 struct: seeds are repeating on battles that often?
 sadakatsu: No, what I mean is, if I play multiple games against opponent A, it's the same game every time.
 Grudo: for me it's not the same
 struct: sorry, I missunderstood
 eulerscheZahl: just a bad selection of which battles of your last submit to randomly show
 meh1001: I noticed it would get out of sync somehow and repeat like that if you mess with the viewing controls
 sadakatsu: Ah, I thought it iterated through all of them.
 meh1001: like if you make it show one of the earlier battles I coulnd't figure out how to make it start again with the current ones
 goolmoos: I put an debug print saying "lol" when a certain something that I expected now to happen, happens. Now I realize it activates exactly when my opponent gets himself stuck at the end of game(Eg inventory 0,0,0,9). So it appears that I accidently programed my bot to laugh at the other bot if he is stuck at the end of the game.
 goolmoos: *expect not to happen
 AntiSquid: there, 2 badges for same contest, well deserved
 sadakatsu: @goolmoos That is awesome and awful at the same time.
 raymoo: I've noticed that the final score display often adds a few points to one or both players compared to the rupee display in-game, is this one of the visual glitches people talk about?
 sadakatsu: No, that's part of the rules.
 raymoo: or is there some kind of bonus applied at the end that I missed
 goolmoos: @raymoo it is not
 sadakatsu: Tier 2 and up ingredients are worth 1 point each.
 goolmoos: you get one point for each ingredient (apart from tier0)
 raymoo: oh, I see
 raymoo: thank you
 lowzhao: Can I assume spell's action id is different from brew's action id?
 sadakatsu: (look at this bottom-of-bronze guy acting like he knows anything  XD)
 goolmoos: @lowzhao yes. id is unique
 lowzhao: @goolmoos 
 lowzhao: thanks!
 adouz: can anyone tell me a way to count the moves of casting to brew a potion?any idea plz?
 sadakatsu: I'm using what is effectively a BFS right now  ^_^;
 rmuskovets: <s>do a DFS traversal</s>
 adouz: i have never used bfs or dfs but I will try
 sadakatsu: Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search are graph traversal algorithms.
 sadakatsu: The first iterates over the vertices using a queue, the other using a stack.
 kreska: adouz when you do a bfs then mantain parent array of every node and when algo finds an answer traverse back the parent array and count the moves this way
 AntiSquid: it's too hard, best to give up before you start
 Q12: wow, I made it from 650 to 326 with my new bot!!!! :grinning:
 adouz: ok thanks guys
 kreska: wow good job
 AntiSquid: :clap::clap_tone1::clap_tone2::clap_tone3::clap_tone4::clap_tone5:
 kreska: so your new bot is two time better
 adouz: AntiSquid i will try anyway cuz am learnnig 
 AntiSquid: was a joke
 adouz: ok
 phord: Nice job, Q12!
 AntiSquid: you're not supposed to give up, the site moto is: No sleep till Legend
 sadakatsu: Yeah, that came across pretty meanly  : /
 Q12: &gt; kreska I wouldn't say it you:sweat_smile:  
 Q12: Thank you :smiley:
 NinjaDoggy: no sleep till legend indeed&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: after you hit legend it's no sleep till top 20&#160;:)
 sadakatsu: I don't think I've ever done better than Silver  : /
 Q12: this is the moto NinjaDoggy
 AntiSquid: it's also custom to ask the others "Hey &lt;insert_name&gt;, when 1st?"
 Cristinel: who is better? Kotake or Koume?
 jacek: yes
 struct: who are those?
 tomatoes: witches
 Cristinel: those 2 witches
 AntiSquid: oh god, thought you were talking about some anime characters .
 v1993: Twinrova is
 Scarfield: which witch is which?
 Astrobytes: Zelda, Ocarina of Time etc etc
 jacek: celestia or luna?
 jacek: i think i have some idea for next contest
 RockyMullet: art is better than pretty much all the previous contest imo
 jacek: did they pay $$$ for license?
 Astrobytes: yeah, it's visually brilliant
 Cristinel: I wonder how the soup tastes at the end after 6 brews
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://kamisamahajimemashita.fandom.com/wiki/Kotake">https://kamisamahajimemashita.fandom.com/wiki/Kotake</a>
 jacek: that reminds me of some bartender game
 jacek: when you mix drinks and give to customers
 tomatoes: valhalla
 jacek: something older
 jacek: from 90s or early 00s
 NoobCod3: I want somebody to be my friends because I have none&#160;:(
 LordSkaven: I am sure if you ask another 100 times it will work
 AntiSquid: no, just 99 times, since you already asked once
 Cristinel: Does anybody here also have a day job?
 Astrobytes: Ofc
 casmith789: ofc lol
 NoobCod3: Can somebody be my friend(s)?
 Edrevan: Most people here are not students
 AntiSquid: i think this is the worst time to ask this when most people work from hom lol Cristinel 
 Cristinel: how do you make time for both
 AntiSquid: also some have holiday
 Xenoid: 8 hrs work, 12 hrs contest, 4 hrs sleep
 AntiSquid: also maybe some work night shift
 Xenoid: or something
 Edrevan: Cristinel look for the "useful resources" page for codingame contests. On it you'll find Bob's excellent article about reaching legends in less than 10 hours of code
 Edrevan: TL;DR&#160;: it's about being smart and efficient (which is harder said than done...)
 Edrevan: easier*
 Cristinel: I wanted to take a some days off for enjoing the contest
 dbf: wise decision!
 AntiSquid: Edrevan imo times changed since the and competition gets harder each time :P
 NoobCod3: im eating a salad 
 NoobCod3: lol
 Skynse: yummy
 NoobCod3: I know I also have ranch
 Skynse: I haven't had a salad in such a long time
 Edrevan: True&#160;! It could be interesting to have a "time efficiency" survey or something. Ask everyone how much time they spent on the contest, compare to their rating
 NoobCod3: @Skynse since how long?
 Skynse: like 2 years 
 Skynse: could be less
 NoobCod3: dayum
 Cristinel: I always do Bob's approach, I never got in Legend yet
 NoobCod3: you should get one lol
 Skynse: I eat healthy foods and all, I just haven't had a salad 
 Skynse: mmmm, that crunch
 Cappefra: how does the AI work btw? does it get better with time until the opening of the next league?
 Edrevan: TBH this contest and the previous one weren't a good match for it
 NoobCod3: thats good that you eat healthy foods
 NoobCod3: there's also chicken in there
 NoobCod3: coding has made my typing speed much faster
 Skynse: Yeah I eat meat to :stuck_out_tongue:
 Skynse: wrong emoji
 NoobCod3: :thumbsup:
 Edrevan: Cappefra when the boss is not available they just put the "Default" one, whichever league it is.
 Cristinel: Cappefra what bot?
 AntiSquid: were you here during ocean of code&#160;? Edrevan 
 NoobCod3: @Skynse wanna be friends?
 Skynse: sure
 NoobCod3: ok
 Jdools05: Hey world, my code doesnt save when I leave the page for the fall challenge, any idea why?
 NoobCod3: I finally have a friend
 Cristinel: NoobCod3, I'm also available
 NoobCod3: I don't @Jdools05
 NoobCod3: absolutely no idea
 NoobCod3: @Cristinel wanna be friends?
 Cristinel: sure
 Edrevan: AntiSquid yeah, didn't have much luck with it ^^ Never could get my triangulation code to work, and I suck at "longest paths" type problems
 NoobCod3:&#160;:)
 jacek: Jdools05 you have to run code at least once
 NoobCod3: true
 Edrevan: but it was really fun
 AntiSquid: Jdools05 not sure what you mean but you could just click this&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/">https://www.codingame.com/</a>
 AntiSquid: it takes you to home page :P
 NoobCod3: IoI
 winston444: hello noobs
 NoobCod3: hello
 NoobCod3: and I am a noob
 NoobCod3: its the truth
 winston444: hhh me too
 NoobCod3: oh
 Skynse: I've been programming for a while
 NoobCod3: i thought you were a pro
 Skynse: It becomes easier over time
 winston444: nice
 NoobCod3: @Skynse can you teach me python?
 Skynse: I used to think I sucked at python....until I started making stuff
 jacek: good you didnt suck pythons :v
 NoobCod3: im just learning python I need somebody to teach me
 AntiSquid: wtf man, jacek
 NoobCod3: oof
 AntiSquid: gross
 NoobCod3: brb
 AntiSquid: off
 winston444: im pro in algorithme :blush:
 NoobCod3: noice
 struct: :hammer:
 Cristinel: NoobCod3 did you enter this Fall contest?
 NoobCod3: yea
 Skynse: A lot of people always ask other people to teach them how to program, here's what I did. I learned the syntax of the language, then I did research on basic data structures and programming logic (if statements, else statements etc). After a while, I decided to learn object oriented programming and classes (that helped a lot). My first actual program was a quadratic equation solver
 NoobCod3: but i suck at coding
 Glitch-_-: yo
 Skynse: Start making stuff
 NoobCod3: that's why I need somebody to teach me python
 Glitch-_-: how life
 NoobCod3: and I don't know python that much
 Skynse: Start with the basics by learning functions
 Glitch-_-: no
 Glitch-_-: he is wrong
 AntiSquid: no hammer please struct 
 NoobCod3: -_-
 Glitch-_-: lol
 NoobCod3: im tired
 Cristinel: do you know other programing language or programing expirience?
 Glitch-_-: help
 winston444: you can learn on youtube
 NoobCod3: JAva
 NoobCod3: Java
 Skynse: C, C++ and Java, but C is a brain twister
 NoobCod3: I know this code for Java
 Skynse: I prefer to use C++ for anything that doesn't work super closely with hardware (drivers etc)
 NoobCod3: system.out.print("Hello Java")Its bad tho
 AntiSquid: did you know your submit finished faster when you type in chat&#160;?
 AntiSquid: finishes *
 Skynse: what submission?
 NoobCod3: yea what submission
 NoobCod3: i might stream on twitch for CodinGame
 Cristinel: NoobCod3 where did you get stuck&#160;?
 NoobCod3: LOL but I suck at coding
 NoobCod3: @Cristinel what?
 AntiSquid: hard audience
 Cristinel: you said you need help with python
 jacek: thats what she said
 NoobCod3: HOW DARE YOU Just kidding
 NoobCod3: hahahahhahahahahhaha
 LordSkaven: AntiSquid, euler already did the troll of the day.
 Cristinel: NoobCod3 about page:
 Cristinel: About
 NoobCod3: @everybody if any of you wanna watch my stream on twitch (even if i do it) search monsterlovegames
 NoobCod3: @Cristinel I do need help with coding
 NoobCod3: python
 AntiSquid: ok, but i am here to chat @_@ if i may LordSkaven
 NoobCod3: I'm home alone:grimacing:
 NoobCod3: JK
 nvergnac: Anyone knows how i can switch league in the challenge&#160;? I've met the requirements to get to the next league but it doesnt seems to work
 NoobCod3: nobody's talking&#160;:(
 Cristinel: just wait a bit
 NoobCod3: Im looking at your profile @Cristinel
 AntiSquid: i don't have permission to, NoobCod3
 Cristinel: nice
 Glitch-_-: Hi
 Glitch-_-: I like your cut g
 NoobCod3: @AntiSquid don't have permission to what?
 NoobCod3: '_'
 MoMaT: nvergnac, you need to wait for all the battles to finish. and *then* be higher than boss.
 nvergnac: oh ok so it takes almost an hour
 NoobCod3: do any of you have discord?
 Glitch-_-: hi
 Glitch-_-: hi
 Glitch-_-: you guys at school
 nvergnac: @Momat, thanks
 Glitch-_-: yes or no
 NoobCod3: yes
 Glitch-_-: what school
 NoobCod3: umm
 NoobCod3: bilingual
 NoobCod3: schoo
 NoobCod3: l
 Glitch-_-: where is that
 AntiSquid: school of life
 NoobCod3: BW
 NoobCod3: I wonder if there is any coding schools because if there is than I would want to go to one
 MoMaT: yeah in bronze, with this many people, the battles will be slow. but you will get there eventually&#160;:)
 NoobCod3: LOL]
 NoobCod3: uno dos tres cuatro tacos
 Glitch-_-: si
 struct: Try again
 Glitch-_-: si
 Glitch-_-: yes
 Glitch-_-: yes
 NoobCod3: don't forget the rice and beans on the plato
 struct: ok, stop flooding chat
 NoobCod3: boy you don't know spanish
 Glitch-_-: f
 AntiSquid: Glitch-_- dude .
 Glitch-_-: f
 Glitch-_-: f
 AntiSquid: press F to pay respect&#160;?
 NoobCod3: Guys Ima stream in a bit follow me on twitch: monsterlovegames
 Glitch-_-: ok
 Glitch-_-: what do you stream
 NoobCod3: typing 
 Glitch-_-: bru
 NoobCod3: and coding sometimes
 NoobCod3: just my hands
 Glitch-_-: nahh I am not watching you
 NoobCod3: like the keyboard
 NoobCod3: your bully
 Glitch-_-: no
 Glitch-_-: I am not
 AntiSquid: bullies don't have an avatar so ...
 NoobCod3: true @AntiSquid
 MoMaT: AntiSquid, what are your thought about this contest?
 AntiSquid: any particular aspect you want me to talk about?
 MoMaT: You have some experience in making one with the MOBA-like one, which was very original.
 MoMaT: Does it ignite you with joy?
 MoMaT: I mean, is it doll, or run of a mill, nothing special, another optimisation fest...
 MoMaT: *cool
 NoobCod3: he's not answering
 NoobCod3: guys what's the time zone for you
 AntiSquid: i don't like the graphics, apart from that i like that it's unique, def optimization fest later on (imo), i don't have time for it
 struct: I think the game is good
 phord: PST here
 struct: But I'm bad at it
 NoobCod3: what time
 AntiSquid: how do you feel about it momat&#160;?
 MoMaT: The witches look great, I give you that. The visualisation of moves not so much. You can't step through and see deliveries for example.
 AntiSquid: not sure why my experience for the contest creation matters though, this one is clearly better advertised :P
 AntiSquid: most popular contest so far 5k before half the contest .
 MoMaT: For me there is almost nothing to mess with in your opponents play. No sneaky "place the mines at the baseline" thing...
 NoobCod3: mine is 12:21
 MoMaT: I meant that as a maker of one, you faced the problem of balancing different aspects of the contest.
 AntiSquid: you can try to deny useful spells for the opponent no? 
 eulerscheZahl: " def optimization fest later on (imo)"we are already into the CPU masterrace
 AntiSquid: and then you can try to steal brews (bit difficult)
 sadakatsu: Well!  My dropping of LEARN as an option bumped me up more than 1200 places in Bronze.
 MoMaT: Which I'm not sure this one is doing so well...
 AntiSquid: i mean to progress to next league euler
 AntiSquid: i have 3 ifs and 10 commented lines of ruby code, so ...
 NoobCod3: I'm watching TV and chatting LOL
 eulerscheZahl: legend in python? i laugh at you
 Icebox: come at me
 Icebox: I'll clap u
 NoobCod3: OOf
 Icebox: noone talks smack about python and gets away with it
 NoobCod3: I guess that's true
 Icebox: except maybe this contest cause my C++ code does in 4ms what my python code did in 800ms
 Icebox: :eyes:
 sadakatsu: There's no smack about Python that Python does not make self-evident  ; )
 AntiSquid: there's not much to balance here MoMaT
 MoMaT: I don't think you can really mess with spells so much, it's too costly. If it was turn-based, and the spell goes to one player only, that would be different.
 NoobCod3: don't make the argument (even if it is) violent
 AntiSquid: not sure how much this matches the original board game they ported
 AntiSquid: people try to steal 0 cost spells MoMaT
 MoMaT: It's the same, just simultanous turns.
 wlesavo: get in legend -&gt; submit in python -&gt; easy first language
 Cristinel: how Catan board game will work as a future contest?
 Icebox: wlesavo shhhh
 AntiSquid: there are 7 D users eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: i want 7k users
 MoMaT: when I say balance, I meant the algorithmic efficiency vs. the strategic depth.
 wlesavo: but im facinated by this guys in top30 with python
 AntiSquid: just algo . optimize the search . that's all i can see MoMaT
 MoMaT: most fun contests are those in which people come up with different ideas and you need to counter them in your play.

 eulerscheZahl: someone edited the CG wikipage today
 MichaelPu: wlesavo, your'e gonna have a tough fight for first in python&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: but didn't add typescript
 NoobCod3: join the CLASH OF CODE RN
 AbundantPuddle: You didn't aske me to Euler. xp
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 NoobCod3: I joined
 Uljahn: MichaelPu: waiting for your postmortem
 kovi: nice submit euler
 MichaelPu:&#160;:) ty
 RockyMullet: nice gj
 RockyMullet: showing those C++ scrubs the power of C#
 MoMaT: AntiSquid, there is one difference with the board game. universal upgrade spells. any items could be levelled up.
 MoMaT: here it's always specific input and output.
 wlesavo: MichaelPu nah im not sure ill even get in legend, this plan wont work for me :smiley: but yeah, i hope there will be pms from top pythons
 eulerscheZahl: partial opponent analysis now&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: would those upgrades make this game more like code 4 life?
 struct: show mercy euler
 eulerscheZahl: pb still the best (crashing on 1 spell)
 NoobCod3: I did the CLASH OF CODe
 wlesavo: oh, pb have a broken bot in arena?
 MoMaT: I haven't played C4L, but it's perhaps easier to have it generic, when played with a human brain&#160;:)
 LordSkaven: Top 300, yeah boy
 wlesavo: some how it always crashes when i try to play him
 eulerscheZahl: yes, a referee update makes him lose some games
 Soulee: Hello!what I have to do when OPPONENT_CAST&#160;?
 wlesavo: oh i see
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/503469099">https://www.codingame.com/replay/503469099</a>
 AntiSquid: nothing Soulee
 AbundantPuddle: TypeScript was added to the Wiki page. I hope this pleases the almighty Euler.
 eulerscheZahl: blue+green=yellow makes him crash
 RockyMullet: Soulee it's only to tell you what spell the enemy learned, in case you wanna do some prediction
 lNitsua: my first thought when I saw opponent_cast was that you could cast spells on your opponent
 Cristinel: same here
 lNitsua: would be a neat, but very difficult addition
 rwilson: they're more interesting in terms of figuring out what you opponent COULD do ( i.e. their shortest spell path to a set of resources is 3 turns, but yours is 2, then you can beat them to brewing that potion )
 Soulee: Thnx!
 Soulee: so I print wait?
 NinjaDoggy: REWRITE COMPLETE! TOP 10 HERE WE COME!
 RockyMullet: NinjaDoggy do it
 CommanderCero: DESTROY THEM
 zahariaca: F
 HackingHues: any difference between bronze and silver... or do I have to read lol
 Illedan: NinjaDoggy, you can't get top 10 with that 1 lose failure :P
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;;(
 NinjaDoggy: i got blocked
 NinjaDoggy: down to resubmit
 eulerscheZahl: what's that ille?
 CommanderCero: resubmit until you get top 10
 AntiSquid: HackingHues your opponents are now harder
 rwilson: HackingHues - bronze description claims "All the rules are now unlocked!"
 NinjaDoggy: opponent sim is next on the board i guess
 HackingHues: thx&#160;:)
 MoMaT: hmmm... lNitsua, I like this idea. casting a "messing spell", for some high cost would be nice...
 wlesavo: euler did referee update conserned only spells?
 eulerscheZahl: and viewer, warning messages
 wlesavo: oh i see thx
 MoMaT: wlesavo, there are now proper commits in GH repo, so you can track it there directly
 eulerscheZahl: the first update was an amend, not sure why
 eulerscheZahl: maybe to hide the boss code?
 MoMaT: like that would make any difference&#160;:) look at the numbers in bronze...
 eulerscheZahl: i think bob submitted the default AI (not sure)
 eulerscheZahl: ranks in bottom silver
 NinjaDoggy: ok nvm, top 10 isn't happening yet&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: at least he was first early in the contest. and same language as the boss
 eulerscheZahl: fix it ninja
 AntiSquid: i would have used it to skip wood . so i can start with full rules
 AntiSquid: done a quick and dirty python instead :P
 eulerscheZahl: oh, nice <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vkaelm">https://prnt.sc/vkaelm</a>
 NinjaDoggy: he's back at the top!
 AntiSquid: you can add more 1s with a crash submit
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 wlesavo: 1111/1111
 eulerscheZahl: still almost a week to go. i need holidays after this
 mojojojo: what changes if you move from bronze to silver?
 eulerscheZahl: the color
 PatrickMcGinnisII: alot of processing on the leaderboard
 AntiSquid: opponents have +1 stamina and charisma
 mojojojo: okay
 mojojojo: i believe antisquid
 wlesavo: more games to lose in a submit also
 AntiSquid: bronze last rule change MojoJojo
 mojojojo: what rule
 Barimehdi77: is the spells id always fix (78,79,80,81)?
 mojojojo: so apart from the trolling, only difference is your bot only starts from the bottom of your league after a submit?

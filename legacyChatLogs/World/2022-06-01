 j4at: Uljahn. Nope I given it all 2560 cores of my gpu :D
 j4at: Its all about latency. The latency spikes more often when I have to move more data to the gpu
 Augreis: hello
 Augreis: is possible to pass vue.js test in this&#160;?
 Augreis: i dont found the locate of this tests
 j4at: And i'm using all cores to send data. The other possible cause of the problem is training is slow. One of those 2 is the reason becuase I did some profiling and and all other parts of my code doesn't use that much time
 Leeward: @Augreis If you're looking for a certification there won't be one for Vue here, because it's a JavaScript framework, not a language.
 Augreis: i know
 Augreis: i search test to compete my skill
 Leeward: Then try the JS puzzles?
 Leeward: I started playing the "CodinGame Sponsored Contest" for reverse engineering. If I understand correctly, I'm supposed to use the scores I got on the test cases to try and determine how to optimise the output? Do the test case names mean anything?
 Uljahn: yes :smirk:
 Leeward: Thanks. And the test cases appear to be deterministic as well?
 nco45: hii

 Leeward: Is it possible to see the output of individual test cases after clicking play all?
 5DN1L: where?
 5DN1L: which puzzle?
 derjack: the reverse engineering? i doublt it&#160;:?
 Leeward: Well I mean in general
 Leeward: if I click a test case it runs again
 derjack: for a short time, before it finishes next test case
 Leeward: I guess I just have to run them one by one then

 Sephirious: In kotlin, I want to compare like I have a string called STR
 Sephirious: if(STR[i] == "A")
 Sephirious: But it gives error
 Sephirious: How can I do this in Kotlin&#160;?
 zakacat: use equals or compareTo?
 Sephirious: But I dont want to compare it fully
 Sephirious: Just a 1 index
 zakacat: hmm, then I dunno, haha, sorry. I have been meaning to learn Kotlin
 zakacat: is you just want the first index, use 0 instead of i?
 Mortis_666: Sephirious use single quote instead of double, STR[i] == 'A'
 Wontonimo: o/
 Mortis_666: \o
 Wontonimo: _o/ \o_  
 Wontonimo: are you coding anything these days Mortis_666 or just lurking like me?
 Mortis_666: learning rust :D
 jacek: :neutral_face:
 Wontonimo: coolness.  I haven't, but it sure looks interesting
 Wontonimo: i'm a fan of the compiler doing extra checking
 Mortis_666: what extra checking?
 Wontonimo: I thought it checks variable usage like un-intended mutation
 Mortis_666: ah yes
 Mortis_666: and unused variable
 struct: whats unintended mutations?
 struct: can you provide an example in c++?
 Wontonimo: int threshold = 5; // don't modify this, it's a constantthreshold++;
 Wontonimo: yes, you could declare it as const, so it is a weak example
 struct: so it reads my comments?
 jrke: i am not sure how to make NN model in numpy
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/89217700-ff22-4867-956f-4c6309ee7afb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/89217700-ff22-4867-956f-4c6309ee7afb</a>
 jrke: this is in pytorch 
 Wontonimo: but my understanding is that in rust if you declare it as int but don't modify it, rust says it's an error.
 Wontonimo: you'd have to either modify it or declare it as const.
 jacek: rust is supposed to be memory secure. no random out of bounds memory changing
 struct: I see
 Wontonimo: jrke, I'm not familiar with pytorch, but in tensorflow you can query the graph 
 Wontonimo: let me get an example ...
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hExuGXyXYdBOAgjEXZcA2aXfUUEzhel0?usp=sharing">https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hExuGXyXYdBOAgjEXZcA2aXfUUEzhel0?usp=sharing</a>
 Uljahn: i think he wants to reimplement this in pure numpy...
 jrke: yes in pure numpy
 Wontonimo: yeah, that example i shared does that for tensorfly
 jacek: is this tic tac toe?
 jrke: jacek yes
 jrke: just trying first ML project
 jrke: lol
 jacek: nice
 Wontonimo: yeah, in that link i shared down in the section "Show that it is "just" matix operations" it shows it can be run as numpy
 Mortis_666: Wontonimo u can decalare an int and dont modify it, it wont give any errors
 jrke: oh so just matrix multiplication + bias
 jrke: for each layer right?
 jacek: yes
 jrke: cool thnx
 jacek: supervised or reinforcement?
 Wontonimo: I don't know what these lines do in pytorch jrkemodel = model.float()model.load_state_dict(state_dict)
 Wontonimo: so, i'm kinda lost of how to do your first input using a state_dict
 Wontonimo: oh, load_state_dict just loads the model from memory.  nvm
 Wontonimo: jrke, you can probably replace all the class code with simply this

 jrke: i have done this ^
 jacek: and what error
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vstU_NElTZEc">https://prnt.sc/vstU_NElTZEc</a>
 jacek: try self.weight.T
 Uljahn: or np.matmul(self.weight, x)
 jrke: what is self.weight.T jacek?
 DomiKo: transposition
 DomiKo: from code we can't guess it weights are [64, 9] or [9, 64]
 jrke: weights are 64*9
 DomiKo: soo, you can't multiply [9] times [64, 9]
 DomiKo: but you can do [64, 9] times [9] or [9] times [9, 64]
 jrke: ahhh
 jrke: thnx jacek Uljahn and DomiKo it worked now!
 jrke: both worked self.weight.T and matmul(self.weight, x)
 DomiKo: As they should
 jrke: i have another doubt
 jrke: when i am saving weights as numpy arrays then weights are differing when compared to weights saved in the form of list 
 jrke: for eg
 jrke: when saving in form of list
 jrke: one weight is -0.029900996014475822
 jrke: while same in form of numpy array is getting saved as -0.029901   
 DomiKo: python float is diffrent from numpy float
 jacek: it can be the same, but printed differently
 jrke: so what should i consider for better result?
 jrke: list or numpy
 jacek: youre doing stuff in numpy, use numpy
 jrke: currently i am saving them in form of list
 jrke: then load it from np.array(weight_in_list)
 jacek: afaik python float is double, and you set numpy as float32
 jacek: for NN that kind of precision loss is negligible
 jrke: oh oki
 jrke: and also will make a shorter code
 DomiKo: a bit
 jacek: or even 32bits
 jrke: :smiley:

 shaquille.oatmeal: hey, I was wondering if anybody could help me out with the mad pod racing X,Y coordinates thing. Its really freaking confusing and I need help.
 jacek: you have Y, Y in code?
 Wontonimo: what level are you on in mad pod racing?  Have you finished the tutorial and got to wood 2 yet?
 shaquille.oatmeal: Im on the tutorial :sweat_smile:
 jacek: what do you have in code so far
 shaquille.oatmeal: basically nothing 
 5DN1L: he's still on Wood 3 I think
 jacek: there should be at least starter code ;d
 Wontonimo: do you understand the code?
 jrke: xD
 Wontonimo: do you understand that the print part of the code is what is being sent to the referee and dictates the next action&#160;?
 Wontonimo: hey, sorry for being afk jrke for the NN talk.  I re-read all the above and agree with all the feedback everyone gave you.  Good stuff
 jrke: thnx wontonimo!
 Wontonimo: have you verified that your pytorch and your numpy implementation give exactly the same output for a few inputs?  (well, within 0.01% is fine)
 jrke: yeah tried 2 matches with hardcoded moves gave same outputs

 Ghoskii: i just need help to start it 
 5DN1L: so which part specifically?
 5DN1L: what don't you understand?
 jacek: what is your programming skill? maybe try some easier puzzle
 Rock_Timmy1: anyone here knowing python really well?=
 5DN1L: you have a python question?
 5DN1L: just ask it if so
 Rock_Timmy1: i came across the function String.lower() which to my mind makes a String lowercase but i found someone use it like this: "String.lower()!=1" how does this work ... i mean the method is not supposed to return a number or is it?
 jacek: what lang
 jacek: ahh python
 Rock_Timmy1: python
 Rock_Timmy1: 3
 jacek: well it returns string and string&#160;!= 1, so its always true
 Rock_Timmy1: it was apparently used to find out whether the string contains an uppercase or not but I could'nt find anything online
 Rock_Timmy1: yeah it returns the lowercase string but it apparently worked for the person
 5DN1L: you use islower() instead to check
 jacek: and it probably would work if he used True
 5DN1L: lower() is just to convert
 5DN1L: islower() is to check
 Rock_Timmy1: if 8&lt;=len(l)&lt;=15 and ' ' not in l and l.lower()!=l and any(str(i) in l for i in range(10)): the string should be between 8 and 15 char, may not contain a space and has to contain atleast one uppercase and one number
 Rock_Timmy1: thats his if-clause
 5DN1L: oh that's an l not a 1 :joy:
 Rock_Timmy1: l is the string üòÖ
 jacek: O:
 Rock_Timmy1: im blind

 5DN1L: what about it?
 shaquille.oatmeal: Im not sure what to do&#160;;/
 5DN1L: have you tried changing the code in any way?
 shaquille.oatmeal: what do you mean by that?
 shaquille.oatmeal: like adding on to it?
 5DN1L: yeah
 5DN1L: editing it in some way
 shaquille.oatmeal: I beleve thats what im supposed to do...
 5DN1L: Wood 3 League requires you to amend the output code only
 5DN1L: there's one error in the default code, amend it and you're done
 shaquille.oatmeal: i get this message 
 shaquille.oatmeal: Your target should be the X, Y position of the next checkpoint. Can you fix that in the code?
 5DN1L: yes
 jacek: what language
 5DN1L: so what does the output code look like right now?
 shaquille.oatmeal: the output is the highlighted one rigy?
 shaquille.oatmeal: right*
 shaquille.oatmeal: and im using GO
 5DN1L: it should be fmt.Println something
 5DN1L: that line
 shaquille.oatmeal: yeah that
 5DN1L: so, you have to amend that line
 5DN1L: can you see the error in it?
 5DN1L: not the syntax
 shaquille.oatmeal: fmt.Printf("%d %d 50\n", nextCheckpointY, nextCheckpointY)
 5DN1L: it's a variable that's the issue
 5DN1L: you should print X and Y coordinates, right?
 5DN1L: what is that line printing?
 shaquille.oatmeal: moving to a checkpoint i think it is supposed to do im not too sure
 5DN1L: look at the variable names
 5DN1L: read them aloud if needed
 5DN1L: are they printing X and Y coordinates?
 shaquille.oatmeal: i believe so 
 shaquille.oatmeal: the variable is X and Y right?
 5DN1L: sort of
 5DN1L: do you see any character X and Y in that line?
 shaquille.oatmeal: yes
 shaquille.oatmeal: fmt.Printf("%d %d 50\n", nextCheckpointY, nextCheckpointY
 shaquille.oatmeal: i think its at that nextCheckpoint bit
 5DN1L: nextCheckpointY and nextCheckpointY?
 shaquille.oatmeal: i think so?
 5DN1L: read it again?
 5DN1L: do the 2 variable names look the same or different to you?
 shaquille.oatmeal: like put it in the chat again or just read it?
 shaquille.oatmeal: and what do you mean by variably
 shaquille.oatmeal: variable*
 5DN1L: hmmm, do you know what are variables?
 shaquille.oatmeal: not too sure to be honest&#160;:/
 5DN1L: Well, in that case this game is too advanced for you
 shaquille.oatmeal: hold on
 5DN1L: you need some basics of a programming language to do stuff here
 shaquille.oatmeal: oh okay
 5DN1L: it's better for you to learn the basics on some other website first, you can then come back to practise afterwards
 shaquille.oatmeal: okay! Thanks for the help!

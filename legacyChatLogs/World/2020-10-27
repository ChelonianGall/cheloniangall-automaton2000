 Sacrilegious: How can I know if mine can be upgraded to next level?
 Monstrux: lol.
 Monstrux: Sacrilegious, you're coding code royale as well?
 KiwiTae: oh code royale the one with the towers and giants?
 AntiSquid: can you upgrade CIF mines?
 wlesavo: can you upgrade OOC mines?
 LathifSihab: hi
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: can you mine OS upgrades?
 Automaton2000: i want to get into top 10
 JuB420: helo
 JuB420: does someone have diamonds?

 DaNinja: requires 48K memory!
 DylanJohnBerndt: Thanks guys
 Lafihalas: Hey guys, what happened to the interface for ghost in the cell, when it is in "windowed mode" aka. not fullscreen, only the top left section of the game is shown, the rest is cut off, its a little better proportion that is shown on HD, but still the part is cutoff, and that part gets bigger the more i increase the size of the section where i write code

 Astrobytes: I tried with my Casio fx83GT+ and discovered it is dead. Not going downstairs for the other one right now so will take your word for it
 eulerscheZahl: oh, RIP Casio&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I think there's 4 of them in the house in total, scattered around

 darkhorse64: PEBCAC Hall of Fame
 eulerscheZahl: and such an accurate description of the problem
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me of some colleagues "your program is broken"
 darkhorse64: Typical User Story: Description of the problem: the program crashes. Expected state: the program does not crash
 darkhorse64: me: Moved to rejection
 eulerscheZahl: me: fix later when another user complains with more details
 Astrobytes: when I used to work full time at a pharma distribution place, I came in after hours to do some labelling and paperwork to a note that said: "Stopped labelling, machine broken".  We had 10 labelling machines.
 eulerscheZahl: lazy colleague
 Astrobytes: That was a long evening.
 Astrobytes: And our labelling software ran on a really old NT machine
 Astrobytes: Horrible, horrible software.
 Astrobytes: *label design software that is
 eulerscheZahl: and the funny thread got closed&#160;:(
 257832: Ah yes. Sorry eulerscheZahl, I broke your toy. ^^
 eulerscheZahl: i wanted to know which puzzle was 100% broken
 BlaiseEbuth: He gonna post on the dedicated thread... Perhaps
 eulerscheZahl: but first someone doesn't understand the site at all
 BlaiseEbuth: Again...
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think this requires an answer, enough said in that thread already
 Astrobytes: "I just need the method signature and I will implement"
 Astrobytes: some folks need to lighten up a bit
 Skynse: Does the language used determine how fast a bot will perform?
 Skynse: for instance, if I used c++ instead of python, would it respond to input faster
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but that's only a concern for more complicated puzzles and bot programming
 eulerscheZahl: back to the other topic: apparently the Temperatures puzzle is broken :D
 AntiSquid: meaning&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: catch up here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/bug-27-10-2020/187130/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/bug-27-10-2020/187130/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and then have a look at the temperatures puzzle thread
 eulerscheZahl: 171k users who solved it were wrong :shocked:
 AntiSquid: bug exploiters should be banned
 Astrobytes: Man, so many bugged puzzles. It's a wonder so many people keep using the site :P
 Dartisan: Automaton2000 Please fixe that&#160;;-)
 Automaton2000: i am not even a ga
 Hjax: oh noes temperatures is broken
 Hjax: im glad someone pointed it out
 Hjax: :P
 Hjax: its funny because if the site ever glitches and breaks an easy puzzle, no one will believe whoever is reporting it 
 Majeck: I mean
 Majeck: If the person was really insistent then somebody would probably test their answer again
 Majeck: and if it failed then we'd know the puzzle was actually broken
 Astrobytes: There is the odd glitch now and then, but 99.99% of the time it's PEBCAC
 Majeck: PEBCAC?
 Astrobytes: Problem Exists Between Chair and Computer
 Majeck: That's amazing
 Majeck: I'm adding that to my vocabulary
 SPDene: similar to an ID ten T error :P
 Astrobytes: lol, there's a few variations of it. Keyboard and chair etc
 Astrobytes: and yeah SPDene :D
 Dartisan: I hav more to smile on the link Euler posted and hoped Automaton2000 would fix it&#160;;-) Problems could always exists. I don't even know how Codingame manages all the Language upgrades, knowing newer languages could be challenging.
 Automaton2000: if you guys have any idea why?
 AntiSquid: he should have been more specific what is bork.i remember one puzzle was randomly passing or not passing for a language and i had no random lol
 Dartisan: oh my first bots I wrote, I used also random, and it is not so long ago&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: my favorite PEBCAC variation:layer 8 error (in reference to the ISO-OSI model)
 Skynse: "OSI"
 jacek: guys, can you solve it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/LBFmDBW.png">https://i.imgur.com/LBFmDBW.png</a>
 jacek: its not coc
 eulerscheZahl: what's the task?
 jacek: whats in the '?'
 eulerscheZahl: so i have to come up with my own rules?
 eulerscheZahl: reverse clash
 jacek: eeyup
 PatrickMcGinnisII: must be a polish thing
 jacek: polish remover thing?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the answer is 21
 AntiSquid: you need to figure out the pattern basically ...
 eulerscheZahl: 21 is only half the truth
 AntiSquid: why not 42&#160;?
 jacek: why 21 D:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl g/j
 AntiSquid: whatever the pattern is it's confusing af
 jacek: maybe brain's nn isnt powerful enough
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the shaded regions should = 100 and the diff of the light ones should sum to 100, hench 21
 eulerscheZahl: maybe those are just random numbers arranged to drive you nuts
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but 1/2 of 42 is great
 eulerscheZahl: 100 for shaded sounds very arbitrary to me
 eulerscheZahl: any indications why this should be true?
 jacek: and why diff of light ones, they dont sum too 100 hmm
 Christakool: does anyone find a job here?
 Christakool: realistically?
 jacek: ask euler has much they pay him for being mod
 eulerscheZahl: how much?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, u r right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the diff doesn't work
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: my payment is free trolls messaging me when i use my mod powers
 jacek: - taxes
 eulerscheZahl: but as a more serious answer: some companies use codingame for recruiting
 Kr3sZ: but not microsoft... xD
 eulerscheZahl: they'll give you a link and you can solve preselected tasks
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand, what does not work: have a profile here, solve some puzzles and hope to get contacted by a company
 jacek:&#160;:(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what's the answer jacek?
 BlaiseEbuth: Wait What&#160;?! I'm waiting since more than 5 years and you're tellin' me I will not get a job like this&#160;! :rage:
 jacek: i dont know :D
 eulerscheZahl: google image search is useless <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/v83p1m">https://prnt.sc/v83p1m</a>
 eulerscheZahl: for more than 5 years, not since&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and it's true, you are here for ages :o
 jacek: how come you have solid? i have clock
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... It's CodinGame here not TranslateGame&#160;! ^^
 eulerscheZahl: i'm on winter time now, i don't need a clock
 eulerscheZahl: always waking up too early anyways
 eulerscheZahl: so, who else wants to do a google image search and tell us what they get?
 jacek: perhaps MSmits will make opening book for that
 Astrobytes: Possible related search: ecuadorian serie
 Astrobytes: ^from the puzzle image
 jacek: soccer?
 Astrobytes: seems that way

 PatrickMcGinnisII: back to PEBCAC ...lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: best result is a variation of magic square
 PatrickMcGinnisII: since 67 is prime it shouldn't be a multiplicative thing
 eulerscheZahl: i factored the numbers too. nothing that sticks to my eye
 PatrickMcGinnisII: shaded could be in x,y and non shaded in y,x limiting answer range 1..9,1..9
 eulerscheZahl: i'll go with just random numbers
 Drakkhonian: wtf
 Drakkhonian: for j in range(len(message))&#160;:
 Drakkhonian: somehow this gives me index out of range
 Drakkhonian: for j in range( len(message) )&#160;:
 Drakkhonian: better to read
 Drakkhonian: jsut for clarification it gives me the error on the print( message[j] ) line
 eulerscheZahl: works fine for me
 Drakkhonian: did i break the compiler? lol
 Drakkhonian: unlikely
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/61HIJvc">https://tech.io/snippet/61HIJvc</a>no error
 Drakkhonian: yeah, strage as hell
 eulerscheZahl: not strange. the error must be at a part that you haven't shared
 Drakkhonian: thing is, if i comment the message[j] line the error goes away
 yurv: when j=len(message)message[0:j] is okmessage[j] is out of range, right?
 Drakkhonian: yup
 PatrickMcGinnisII: try lem(msg)-1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: len
 eulerscheZahl: try sharing more code
 Drakkhonian: wait, does len() shouldnt include the last number, should it?
 Drakkhonian: range(4) should be 0 1 2 3
 eulerscheZahl: range(len(string)) goes from 0 to length-1
 Drakkhonian: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/6hUnCLM">https://tech.io/snippet/6hUnCLM</a>
 eulerscheZahl: message = aux
 Drakkhonian: it wont run on the snippet cause no inputs
 eulerscheZahl: what i expected: you shorten the message in that loop
 PatrickMcGinnisII: range defaults to include last # unless you add a start value
 PatrickMcGinnisII: euler is always right tho
 eulerscheZahl: range(x) is from 0 to x-1
 eulerscheZahl: &gt;&gt;&gt; list(range(10))[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
 Drakkhonian: what do you mean shorten the message?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_ref_range2">https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_ref_range2</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: look at line 33
 eulerscheZahl: you have a fixed range defined, with the original message
 eulerscheZahl: then you reassign message to something shorter
 eulerscheZahl: but still go to the old limit
 Drakkhonian: oh
 Drakkhonian: i see now
 Drakkhonian: wow ok
 Drakkhonian: wait tho, it shouldnt shorten the message
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, I'm giving up on the polish magicv square
 eulerscheZahl: it does, because aux is a substring of it
 Drakkhonian: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
 Drakkhonian: no nv,m
 Drakkhonian: it should be right
 Drakkhonian: aux = aux + chr( rotor_list[i][aux2] )
 Drakkhonian: this would add the chr part as string right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Drakkhonian: or do i have to cast it into str() to amke it concatenate properly
 eulerscheZahl: or: aux += chr(...) for short
 Drakkhonian: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: should be fine without str()try it, my python isn't that good
 Drakkhonian: nope, same error
 eulerscheZahl: do you still modify the message variable?
 Drakkhonian: yes
 Drakkhonian: every iteration the message gets changed
 eulerscheZahl: never modify the variable you are iterating over unless you want chaos
 Drakkhonian: so maybe putting the entire message in an aux_string and then updating message after i finished would work
 eulerscheZahl: for c in message:
 Drakkhonian: now that i think about it, its acutally easier to do that then what im trying to do
 eulerscheZahl: for c in message:
 eulerscheZahl: wanted to comment, typo
 eulerscheZahl: try this if you want to iterate over the characters
 Drakkhonian: thing is, i need the actual position of what im using in the string
 Drakkhonian: wait
 Drakkhonian: i DONT
 Drakkhonian: wait no, not good idea
 Drakkhonian: better to just put the message in an aux, change aux, then update message
 Drakkhonian: or just recreate the new message in aux using aux += new_letter
 Drakkhonian: or something
 Drakkhonian: strage tho, cause i also iterated message and updated it in a previous for and it worked fine tho
 Drakkhonian: no, it didnt work
 Drakkhonian: the first for completely emptied the message
 Drakkhonian: thats why it was out of range
 Drakkhonian: jesus
 Astrobytes: print(x, file=sys.stderr) is your friend 
 eulerscheZahl: for (index, value) in enumerate(message):
 eulerscheZahl: gives you the index as well
 Drakkhonian: no, problem wasnt indexing
 Drakkhonian: problem was my stupid brain not working with ord() properly
 eulerscheZahl: replying to an older message, was afk
 Drakkhonian: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: thought you might be interested in learned a handy language feature, my bad
 PatrickMcGinnisII: puzzle tree paths is pretty easy
 eulerscheZahl: there's a reason why it's in the easy section

 Zenoscave: We should call the Codingame Fall Challenge the ozone killer
 Astrobytes: Hope everything goes smoothly and without any crap, not like you *need* the qualification but still&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: I hope so too&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: that will be like a wood league for you
 Zenoscave: the unversity wood league would be nice
 dbdr: Zenoscave: why Ozone Killer?
 eulerscheZahl: busy CG servers?
 CursingLlama: Out of curiousity, is there a reason for the delays for promotion in league puzzles?
 eulerscheZahl: just guessing, was wondering the same
 Zenoscave: Finally someone took the bait! Because the acronym is CFC
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: because CodinGame is mean and wants to force you to take a break
 Zenoscave: Chlorofluorocarbon reference
 eulerscheZahl: but even kidding. making you take a break is the only reason
 dbdr: if the CG servers are in France, they are mostly nuclear-powered
 Zenoscave: just a word pun, no ties to the servers in this joke
 eulerscheZahl: servers are either AWS or Azure. CG made misleading statements
 eulerscheZahl: i know that their email server is till AWS by the headers they send
 dbdr: &gt; www.codingame.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.codingame.com">http://www.codingame.com</a>&gt; is an alias for codingame-work-webapp-app-lb-1764834128.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
 Zenoscave: there you have it
 Zenoscave: &gt; lsmith.zenoscave.com
 eulerscheZahl: they wanted to move the user code execution to Azure

 dbdr: this?
 Zenoscave: yes
 dbdr: ah, copy paste into pidgin
 Zenoscave: ah external client.
 dbdr: www.codingame.com
 dbdr: ^ typed in webchat
 Zenoscave: makes sense
 Astrobytes: lawl, CFC
 Astrobytes: ooh scroll
 Astrobytes: well played regardless
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/txj72l.jpg">https://snipboard.io/txj72l.jpg</a>Regulus is motivated
 Astrobytes: haha, that is true dedication
 eulerscheZahl: *tree dedication
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Zenoscave: What problem is that on?
 eulerscheZahl: tree paths
 Zenoscave: Makes sense
 AntiSquid: should just pull a westicles and tehn retire from doing it in all languages
 Zenoscave: dbdr: How do you keep pidgin from showing enter/exits
 dbdr: I don't. but it must be an option
 eulerscheZahl: challenge accepted
 eulerscheZahl: did you see it? :imp:
 Zenoscave: yes euler. 
 Zenoscave: along with 30 others
 AntiSquid: mass join leave&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: the enter/leave messages are what made me switch back from external client to webchat
 AntiSquid: (don't have pidgin open)
 eulerscheZahl: i reloaded the website twice
 Zenoscave: But can you do this?
 Zenoscave: it doesn't show up in webchat. nevermind
 dbdr: 30 others? I just saw euler reenter twice
 AntiSquid: ah, quite sure you can automate that nonsense somehow. back when i was using messenger for yahoo / hotmail there were some troll tools to instantly leave and rejoin 20-30 times
 AntiSquid: really annoyed friendlist people
 dbdr: Yes I can
 Zenoscave: Nice dbdr
 Zenoscave: 
 AntiSquid:  
 Astrobytes: 
 eulerscheZahl: you forgot the cg icon
 Zenoscave: True enough
 Zenoscave: not a mod unfortunately
 Zenoscave: Don't have the time to truly mod appropriately often enough
 Astrobytes: nobody does, it's a team effort&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: Is their an application process?
 Zenoscave: there*
 Zenoscave: Also pidgin has a plugin for mute enter/exit
 eulerscheZahl: wait for thibaud to ask and then hoppe for astro to say your name while you are offline
 Astrobytes: Don't think so, Thibaud just went on a mad recruitment drive a few months back
 Astrobytes: lol euler

 dbdr: don't see it?
 Zenoscave: Left and Right tree matching?
 dbdr: yes
 Zenoscave: I don't get it
 Zenoscave: r/woosh
 dbdr: the lol is in the string literals
 eulerscheZahl: and a string reverse to change the node order
 eulerscheZahl: child-&gt;root to root-&gt;child
 dbdr: it's not mine, it's a published rust solution
 Zenoscave: must be missing or overthinking something
 dbdr: it's building the string from right to left
 dbdr: you know the end first
 eulerscheZahl: i like that thinking out of the box
 eulerscheZahl: but a little minus on the readability score :D
 dbdr: I did something like that at work once, but not production code, just a proof of concept
 Zenoscave: I should learn rust. Been thinking that or Go should be a good training
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: might be quite readable to arabic speakers
 Zenoscave: Little stagnated on python progress
 jacek: rust? :x
 Zenoscave: jacek would you choose Rust or Go?
 dbdr: both MS and Facebook just posted job offers for positions to work on the rust compiler
 Zenoscave: hmmmmm...
 jacek: though decision
 Zenoscave: that settles it. Go it is
 dbdr: lol
 Zenoscave: The only letter in FAANG I want to be a part of is the worst one.
 jacek: if you choose rust, your bot wont work in debug mode and smits wont counter book you
 Zenoscave: (flame bait) but it's the G
 dbdr: I don't like either companies. but it's good news for the language in terms of viability. I don't expected either would have control anyways
 dbdr: Mozilla is the historic sponsor, and the community is diverse
 Zenoscave: I love me some mozilla
 Hjax: love it while you can, it might evaporate soon&#160;:(
 dbdr: yeah, not in the best shape&#160;:(
 jacek: hm?
 dbdr: Mozilla announced layoffs
 Hjax: mozilla is going downhill in a hurry 
 Hjax: they laid off a ton of their staff recently 
 Zenoscave: 25% I read
 eulerscheZahl: that's more than kovi did :o

 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 Hjax: what a pleasant, helpful community, the power of open source
 eulerscheZahl: my git skills aren't good enough to even commit nothing :D
 eulerscheZahl: it's still hacktoberfest, make a pull request :D
 Zenoscave: `git commit --allow-empty`
 jacek: git commit -m suicide
 Astrobytes: hell no, I don't want that t-shirt
 Zenoscave: Yeah that t-shirt is not the one I'm after 
 Zenoscave: It is a farce really
 eulerscheZahl: it is
 eulerscheZahl: but CG has 20 tshirts this time&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: I'm already prepping
 Zenoscave: Any news as to the game type / play 
 eulerscheZahl: multiplayer
 Astrobytes: Bot programming
 Zenoscave: FoW
 Zenoscave:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: unknown
 Astrobytes: Oh probably&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: what's the theme
 eulerscheZahl: the rules are foggy for now
 Astrobytes: Zelda witches
 Zenoscave: So that's the known portion?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.ponyos.org/">https://www.ponyos.org/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh, 6.0 is out
 Astrobytes: :no_mouth:
 Astrobytes: yeah Zenoscave
 26: e
 26: start clash little boy
 jacek: oO
 Zenoscave: who you calling pinhead 26
 Astrobytes: end acquiescence large man
 Zenoscave: lol Astrobytes nice word use
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl:  I probably will use C# again this competition
 Zenoscave: got me my first legend in comp last time
 eulerscheZahl: i see C# I give&#160;:+1:
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 Zenoscave: Was 3rd in C# for ooc
 eulerscheZahl: then i think i was 2nd
 eulerscheZahl: illedan :rage:
 Zenoscave: wonder who could have been first :thinking:
 Zenoscave: ah you beat me to it
 eulerscheZahl: meh, got the language achievement already
 eulerscheZahl: only top3 and victory missing
 eulerscheZahl: but somehow those seem to be the hardest
 Hjax: if teccles has actually quit for good maybe i can get #1 java 
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i should try java next time :thinking:i practiced it a bit while using the codingame SDK
 eulerscheZahl: and it's similar to C# anyways
 Hjax: no no no, its ok you can use C#
 Hjax: :P
 Astrobytes: Think you're fine staying with C#, don't see what you'd get switching to Java
 Hjax: he'd get a shot at stealing my #1 language ranking trophy 
 Hjax: thats what he'd get 
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: but C# has .net Core and release mode now
 eulerscheZahl: so i'll stick with it
 Astrobytes: I guess re-implementing the engine would be easier, still gotta make it performant though
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the game
 Astrobytes: true
 eulerscheZahl: last time i didn't even read the referee code
 eulerscheZahl: nor did i code the full engine
 Astrobytes: Last time I didn't even code
 eulerscheZahl: nocode
 Astrobytes: Well, not much
 Hjax: im really hoping this game is nothing like ooc and pacman
 eulerscheZahl: i hate fog
 Hjax: me too 
 jacek: ooc pacman it is
 Astrobytes: OOC was a lot better than pacman
 Astrobytes: imo
 Hjax: i didnt make an honest attempt at ooc, so i guess im not in a real position to complain about it 
 Astrobytes: But I wasn't keen on either
 Hjax: but im still bitter about pacman 
 Astrobytes: OOC was nice just cause it was a 'free' contest cause of lockdown
 Hjax: i enjoyed utg a lot 
 Astrobytes: No shit :D
 Hjax: :P
 jacek: will the s appear for contest?
 Astrobytes: The 's'?
 jacek: struct
 Astrobytes: oooh
 Astrobytes: who knows
 Astrobytes: Hope he's OK
 elmajouli: Hello world&#160;! :stuck_out_tongue:
 Hjax: oh right he just vanished a while ago didnt he
 Astrobytes: yep
 Astrobytes: Hi elmajouli
 Gabbek: Anyone interested in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-of-the-realm">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-of-the-realm</a>&#160;? I think I like it too much and I'm waiting for some more people to submit&#160;:)
 Hjax: i wonder what scary people will play the contest 
 Hjax: probably karliso
 Astrobytes: Oh I haven't done anything serious for that yet Gabbek, forgot about it tbh
 hiljusti: it sucks; they're a company with principles
 Astrobytes: Depends on the type of contest Hjax
 hiljusti: oops replying to old news (about mozilla layoffs)
 Astrobytes: chat scroll issues, happens every day&#160;:)
 jacek: 4 wood leagues? w00t
 Gabbek: Just curious, how do you reply to someone directly on the chat, so the message appears in red? Do you have to mention their name, or is it something else?
 Astrobytes: Try BotG jacek, it has about 30
 Astrobytes: Just their name Gabbek
 Gabbek: I see, Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: yep, just like that. And you can autocomplete with the Tab key
 jacek: ok AntiSquid
 hiljusti: neat
 jacek: meh
 Astrobytes: But watch out for 'false positives' like jacek just did
 Astrobytes: (deliberately)
 Gabbek: Oh, that's helpful, awesome. Thank you!
 Astrobytes: no worries&#160;:)
 Gabbek: What's the best way to test your new bot against the old one, I assume just selecting it and trying in the practice mode a lot? (apart from making your own game engine)
 Hjax: brutaltester
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: But watch out for overfitting against yourself
 Gabbek: Aye, for sure. Currently learning some C# and my bot is worse than my python one so no worries yet :D
 Gabbek: I always struggle with codingame... there's just way too many cool things to do. I'm always undecided on what I wanna do next&#160;:(
 Hjax: well theres a contest in two weeks 
 Hjax: so thats something to do :D 
 Gabbek: haven't tried any contest yet, so that would be something new for sure :D
 Hjax: oh contests are my favorite thing 
 Hjax: i get lazy with multis lol
 jacek: contests are bot programming, so do some multi
 Gabbek: I think I like the learning aspect of multis the most, I'm not much of a competitive person
 Gabbek: but it's really great to learn new things and improve a bit&#160;:)
 Hjax: the cool thing about contests (imo) is watching strategies change over the course of the event 
 Hjax: since people are racing to come up with new ideas 
 Gabbek: that's a very cool aspect, for sure - read a bit about it on crystal rush
 Astrobytes: and yeah, you don't have to compete seriously if you don't want to, just participating is cool
 Astrobytes: and yeah Hjax, so true
 Astrobytes: the chat comes alive
 Gabbek: Astrobytes - actually, this is quite funny because with quests I think it incentivize lazy people like me to actually join one :D looks quite funny to have that bronze badge with bot programming while you have some not-so-horrible in legend&#160;:)
 Gabbek: (the 2nd quest is to join the competition)
 Astrobytes: Haha, the quest feature is working then :D
 jacek: yes, even clash haters when on clashing spree
 jacek: went
 Astrobytes: When I first joined CG in 2015 I didn't even realise they had contests going on
 Gabbek: yep, for sure - I was trying to convince one of my colleagues and he wanted to see my profile - the very first question was about the bronze medal, so it's doing some work for sure, hehe
 Gabbek: I haven't realized there were contests for a very long time, now that I think of it
 Gabbek: just one day I randomly clicked on code &amp; magic thing and it was multi - then it was like... ohh, there are contests, interesting. I remember that.
 Astrobytes: There's only 2 official contests per year currently (though we had an extra one due to COVID lockdown this year)
 Astrobytes: I neglected CG for ages, busy with life and other things, then randomly decided to visit again, there was a contest pretty soon and that was that lol
 Astrobytes: Code Royale
 JBM: yikes
 Astrobytes: What a mess of a bot I made :D
 Astrobytes: hey JBM
 JBM: hey Astrobytes
 Gabbek: I really like that you can learn so many things. I used to be very active on codewars - but I got bored after solving 4k+ exercises; it was much more like just doing easy stuff rather than interesting like on codingame
 Gabbek: But I truly appreciate that there's so many different ones for those who look for something else&#160;:) math-related euler page is awesome, love it - even though I really struggle there :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's definitely got an edge on other sites in some respects
 Astrobytes: (CG that is)
 Gabbek: Code Royale - Astrobytes, is that the one where you control two heroes against the other player?
 Astrobytes: Gabbek: No, it's the one with the queens, knights, mines and towers
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/code-royale">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/code-royale</a>
 Gabbek: ohh, right - maybe I'll find some motivation to try further with that one :D
 Astrobytes: 2 heroes against the other player, what's that? Botters of the Galaxy?
 jacek: ultimate tic tac toe
 Gabbek: I usually hit gold and move onto the next exercise / contest - but it never seems to stop, too much interesting puzzles. I'm hoping I'll learn some java after c#, would like to create a puzzle or two for others to enjoy
 Astrobytes: You don't need Java skills to make puzzles unless you use the SDK (non-visual versus visual that is)
 Gabbek: I remember trying Smash the Code one day - had a really hard time with it due to, hmm, "accessibility" of that contest? I gave up in wood 1 :D
 Gabbek: multi*, not contest, whoops
 Astrobytes: Everything becomes accessible at some point in your learning&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: People get scared off with a lot of the multis but you can get really far without even knowing much in the way of specialised search algos etc
 Gabbek: that's very true&#160;:) What's your favorite contest so far? From the multis I've tried I think it would be legends of code &amp; magic - probably because I used to play some heartstone in the past and found it somewhat familar; the cooking one would be my #2, really liked ocean of code as well.
 Gabbek: I think it's all about finding a way to make it enjoyable for yourself, regardless of results - as long as you learn something, it's a net positive, I think
 Gabbek: but surely it's "scary", just like a lot of people don't play ranked games in multiplayer games for similar reason :D
 Astrobytes: You did pretty well in LoCam and OOC right? I wasn't keen on either of those :DI really enjoyed A Code of Ice &amp; Fire
 Astrobytes: Oh and I *hated* the cooking one :D
 Astrobytes: Not as much as I disliked the PacMan one but it was very 'meh' for me! 
 Hjax: im still kicking myself for all of the contests i missed because codingames UI scared me away years ago 
 Astrobytes: And yes, you have a good attitude Gabbek, learning and a healthy dose of fun on the way
 Astrobytes: Same Hjax, though just my not noticing rather than the UI (or maybe that was the reason I didn't notice, it was grim back then lol)
 Gabbek: Currently my python bot is #1 in LoCam, #10 overall, probably my best result so far, in Ice&amp;Fire I see I'm last now, probably because .net core change - should change that soon, I guess :D it was around 20-30ish if I remember correctly. But I guess I should join some contest regardless of everything - if just so to share the strategy I've used, since I've learned so much by reading other people's postmortems.
 Gabbek: Hjax - I can't recall how it used to look back in the day, but it seems some people indeed had this problem
 Hjax: easily the most clunky UI design ive seen on a website
 Astrobytes: You should definitely join! It's a great atmosphere in the chat and really good fun
 Hjax: its much better now 
 Astrobytes: Yeeep
 jacek: eeyup
 Astrobytes: (didn't wanna steal your catchphrase jacek)
 jacek: its not mine
 Astrobytes: it is on here
 Gabbek: I rarely talk/write on forum - rather silent person in general, but it's really great community and it's a pleasure to speak to you guys!
 jacek: i never use forum
 Astrobytes: yes you do
 Gabbek: but I must admit - CG has a very positive effect on me. I play a lot of video games and lately... I'm just getting bored of it - I would rather struggle with one of the exercises :D
 Astrobytes: It is a great community Gabbek, one of the best features of CG 
 Zenoscave: Gabbek do you know SihardOussama
 Hjax: @Gabbek I love discussing contests, and will be in chat for a lot of the upcoming one I imagine, feel free to shoot me a PM if you want to talk some strategy during the contest&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: Gabbek we are gud ppl
 Hjax: a wild ZarthaxX appeared 
 Zenoscave: Pewpew
 Zenoscave: Hiya zarthie
 ZarthaxX: heyo Hjax
 Astrobytes: Hjax mining for tips already
 ZarthaxX: mah man zenopew
 Gabbek: Zenoscave doesn't ring a bell, unfortunately. But maybe if I would see the icon then I would know :D for some reason icons are easier to remember, atleast initially
 Astrobytes: Zarthoutofthedarkness
 ZarthaxX: what the f
 Hjax: @Gabbek same profile picture as you, thats why he asked 
 Zenoscave: It's the same profile
 Zenoscave: *picture
 Zenoscave: ^ what Hjax said
 Gabbek: ohh, I see - well it's from darker than black (anime), so I guess there might be some people using it
 Zenoscave: Interesting
 Gabbek: but I think ZarthaxX profile picture is the most known out of all :D
 Hjax: ive seen a ton of anime, but i havent seen darker than black yet 
 Hjax: ive heard its good though 
 Zenoscave: ZarthaxX what's your picture from
 Astrobytes: It's Zarth Vader
 Gabbek: Hjax most people say that first season is good and 2nd one is worse, if you like nice fighting animation then you would probably enjoy it
 Zenoscave: The bear?
 Astrobytes: (it's not really)
 derjack: cat?
 Hjax: theres lots of anime profile pictures on this site, i had one until i joined the cat army 
 Astrobytes: #catpower
 Zenoscave: Catpower is diminished as it isn't caturday
 Skynse: meow
 Astrobytes: It's Chews-day
 Zenoscave: Like chew toys? Like dogs?
 derjack: chomusuke
 Gabbek: Hjax regarding tactics and contests - sure, will definitely poke you. Do you use discord as well? More than happy to talk about some multis if you would like to as well.
 Astrobytes: My cats chew all sorts of things, one has real pica and chews plastic
 Hjax: yeah im in the CG discord 
 derjack: thereis cg discord
 Hjax: i havent played a ton of multis, mostly just ones for unofficial contests 
 Zenoscave: I have a feeling this'll be a great contest
 Astrobytes: Think most of us are on the CG discord
 Hjax: platinum rift 2, code of kutulu
 Hjax: didnt end up playing code of ice and fire, was busy that week
 Scarfield: there was a unofficial contest for plat rift 2?
 Astrobytes: I hope your feeling is correct Zeno!
 Hjax: there was, the one thibpat ran 
 Astrobytes: Yes Slowoffthemarkfield
 Scarfield: chewstroBytes
 Astrobytes: :D
 Scarfield: i missed that one then&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: Hjax I seem to recall you telling me you were lazy not busy :D
 Zenoscave: Astrobytes ready for a cooking witch version of CaLM&#160;?
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 Hjax: no no no, i was busy some days and lazy the others 
 Scarfield: but then again didnt even submit for the last one Coif
 Astrobytes: :D
 Gabbek: when it comes to easiest multi I think the title would go to Tower Dereference :D
 Astrobytes: lol Zenoscave, hell on Earth
 Zenoscave: That's me!
 Scarfield: Hansel &amp; Gretel recipies
 Hjax: basically i was busy the first week, and then wasnt motivated during the week, and then the contest was almost over by that point 
 Hjax: first weekend* 
 Zenoscave: is there another unofficial currently?
 Hjax: one just ended not too long ago 
 Hjax: next contest of any fashion is the official one in two weeks 
 Scarfield: HYPE&#160;!
 inoryy: rookie mistake to be busy on first weekend
 Astrobytes: I tried to pick some low hanging fruit but ultimately lost a few places. Couldn't be assed to rewrite contest code
 Zenoscave: hey inoryy long time
 inoryy: hello!
 Hjax: inoryy are you going to play the contest? 
 Astrobytes: evening inoryy
 inoryy: I'll probably do the usual
 Gabbek: evening&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: first weekend and quit?
 inoryy: try to get as far as I can within 1 weekend and then pretend I'm too busy the rest of the contest
 Scarfield: xD
 Zenoscave: inoryy What is your bet on fog of war?
 Scarfield: you have "moved" a lot :p
 Gabbek: that's one way to go about it :D
 inoryy: no idea, haven't even looked at the hints or anything; going completely blind
 Zenoscave: there's hints!?!?!
 Astrobytes: Zelda, witches
 inoryy: well now you've ruined it
 Zenoscave: we were over this. right
 Hjax: lol rip inoryy
 Zenoscave: sorry inorry
 inoryy: literally unplayable
 Astrobytes: :P
 Zenoscave: well the type of witch can still be a surprise
 Gabbek: might as well not sign up with so much knowledge already :D
 inoryy: right?
 Zenoscave: queue astro ruining the type
 Hjax: just write your bot now, you already basically know the spec
 Zenoscave: Throw back to recurse during crystal rush
 inoryy: lol
 Astrobytes: Probably a smokescreen for some FOW fighter plane sim anyway, don't worry
 Scarfield: at least there hasnt been a replay shared.. im slow
 Zenoscave: Scarfield are you searching?
 Hjax: oh right we did have a crystal rush replay early didnt we
 Hjax: i totally forgot about that 
 inoryy: first person CSB
 ZarthaxX: Gabbek my profile pic is common? what
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Astrobytes: lol inoryy
 Scarfield: wasnt it patrickMc.. who spoiled it?
 Zenoscave: ZarthaxX if you were a pokemon you'd be a slowpoke
 ZarthaxX: the bear is frm itnernet
 ZarthaxX: the hat is edited
 Astrobytes: FRM ITNERNET
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave pikachu :P
 Gabbek: ZarthaxX not common, just known - as in popular, I've seen it being mentioned just about anywhere, on forums, on discord, often in the chats :D
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes lemme be
 Astrobytes:&#160;;) &lt;3
 Hjax: the bear is actually wearing an eyepatch in the photo already, only the hat is photoshopped
 ZarthaxX: patch also is photoshoped
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Hjax: shhhhh
 Astrobytes: I like Zartho's github pic better
 ZarthaxX: imagine poor bear
 ZarthaxX: that dogo is ded
 Astrobytes: I know, but nice dogo
 Zenoscave: always a good dogo
 Scarfield: 11/10
 Zenoscave: they're good dogs brent
 Gabbek: I don't know any bad dogo, do they exist?
 ZarthaxX: it was an amazing dogo
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 Hjax: the cat in my profile picture will be 19 in a month 
 Zenoscave: nope
 inoryy: is that from potc contest?
 Scarfield: My mom has a dog that was born dead, but they managed  to revive it. Its kind of brain damaged, but still a very good dogo
 Astrobytes: Ah he's a legend Hjax
 Zenoscave: potc?
 inoryy: pirates of the carribbean
 Astrobytes: Pirates of the .. nvm
 inoryy: bear with an eye patch and pirate hat
 Zenoscave: ah right. couldn't think of that one
 Zenoscave: holy butter nuts. Have people been actively playing CSB?
 Astrobytes: promotion happening again?
 Zenoscave: ecurse is at 59.88. did the penguin even get that high?
 Zenoscave: I might be the slowpoke
 inoryy: yeah there's been a bunch of activity in #ru 
 Gabbek: Scarfield that's great news that he got saved! Mine always was afraid of cats... there's one lady who would always walk with her black cat on the leash :D
 Zenoscave: MK active again?
 Astrobytes: Top CSB is now NN dominated Zeno
 Scarfield: yea he is sometimes
 Astrobytes: And yeah he's around again now
 Scarfield: and yea, its super cute, and extra derpy&#160;:)
 Gabbek: Hjax ohh, you're a starcraft player - interesting. I'm "starcraft watcher" on youtube :D
 Egrace: Hi everyone! Can somebody give me some tips how to solve Mars Lander? I mean what approach will be easy enough to use to solve 2nd chapter?
 Scarfield: wait till you meet nerchio then Gabbek
 Hjax: no dont take this away from me 
 Hjax: stop 
 Zenoscave: Almost made legend in ruby no tricks
 Astrobytes: aw bless him Scarfield, had a friend with a similarly brain damaged cat, was the sweetest little thing but needed brushed constantly, couldn't look after himself properly
 Hjax: Nerchio is only 100x better than me at starcraft :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 Hjax: my claim to fame is that i beat alphastar a few times
 inoryy: and it never recovered since
 Hjax: lol
 Zenoscave: what's alphastar
 Hjax: deepminds starcraft agent 
 Gabbek: Egrace hello, hmm - easy enough approach for Mars Lander, now that's a bit of a pickle for me :D
 Astrobytes: "what's alphastar" :o
 Zenoscave: loop{puts "0 3\n0 4"}
 Zenoscave: I'm awful at keeping up with ML stuff
 Egrace: :grimacing:
 Hjax: alphastar is quite good, although not better than the best humans 
 Astrobytes: yet . . .
 cg000: see almost beat it in ruby.
 Hjax: i dont think they are working on it anymore, so my title is safe 
 cg000: gold i mean
 Gabbek: if I'm not mistaken it was hell of expensive and they discontinued it, right?
 Hjax: well, they accomplished what they set out to do 
 Hjax: and published their paper 
 Gabbek: aye, that's for sure&#160;:)
 inoryy: :zipper_mouth:
 Astrobytes: Nerchio is the next evolution of alphastar, and now he competes in bot programming :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Zenoscave: nerchio are you a bot
 Hjax: ive never played nerchio in starcraft, but no doubt he would destroy me 
 Gabbek: Astrobytes ohh, really? Didn't know that
 Zenoscave: Do you know Automaton2000?
 Astrobytes: nice inoryy, look forward to it
 Automaton2000: will have to play with me
 Astrobytes: just kidding Gabbek!!
 Gabbek: Astrobytes and I was about to ask for some link, darn it :D
 Gabbek: I felt for it so easily :P
 Hjax: ive beaten players of nerchios level, although not many times 
 inoryy: wait what are you looking forward to, Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: The things you zippermouthed at inoryy
 Zenoscave: GPT3 is cool though amirite
 Hjax: AutomatonGPT when?
 Zenoscave: oh god
 Scarfield: yea, it seems crazy
 Zenoscave: the world is ready
 inoryy: haha I wouldn't hold my breath Astrobytes
 Scarfield: cant wait for it to ping euler with better jokes
 Astrobytes: Ah, OK. Fair enough&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: What do you get if you cross a highway in a wheel barrow
 Astrobytes: lol Scarfield 
 Zenoscave: run over.
 Scarfield: lol
 Astrobytes: ...
 Zenoscave: You can thank euler for that one
 Astrobytes: Atrocious.
 Astrobytes: Always the best kind of joke.
 Zenoscave: did you know you can't run in a campground
 Gabbek: it's one of those moments when I know that I need to improve my english, because I don't know like 2 words and I don't know if I should laugh or not :D
 Zenoscave: you can only ran. it's passed tents
 Hjax: i got tricked for a while by an article written by GPT-3
 Scarfield: sigh xD
 Astrobytes: FFS Zeno
 Hjax: took me a few paragraphs before i realized it was kind of off
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 inoryy: what's funny is to keep stumbling on conspiracy theories about whether this or that barcode is AlphaStar, some people are *really* convinced too
 Zenoscave: what is barcode
 Hjax: people who name themselves IIIIIIIIIIII
 Hjax: to hide their real name 
 Gabbek: basically a blank name
 Zenoscave: ah
 Astrobytes: that's a thing?
 Gabbek: in starcraft, yeah&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I was totally thinking actual barcodes
 Hjax: yeah, enough people do it that its hard to tell them apart 
 Hjax: so you get anonymous accounts basically 
 Astrobytes: Man I'm out of the SC loop these days
 iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii: here too
 inoryy: AlphaStar played under barcodes too
 Hjax: people sniffed out one of its accounts pretty fast 
 Gabbek: haven't seen it being utilized in starcraft broodwar though - so I guess it's only because AlphaStar used to play under barcodes
 inoryy: not really, took 5 days until first one iirc
 Hjax: nah barcodes happened long before alphastar 
 inoryy: first games were on Friday and first reddit thread was late Tuesday
 Scarfield: well it only really works if more than one does it 
 Hjax: someone beat alphastar and said "gg alphastar" at the end 
 Hjax: made me laugh
 inoryy: yeah I remembed that one&#160;: D
 Hjax: a zerg player who beat alphastar terran with a nydus 
 inoryy: beasty "lost" twice lol
 inoryy: failed a cannon rush and the instaquit the next game
 Hjax: beasty threw super hard 
 Hjax: he should have won that cannon rush game
 Gabbek: beasty had a funny series about pretending to be alphastar
 Hjax: alphastar final never really solved cannon rush, which is why i could beat it
 Hjax: i think i could have beaten it on my own mouse / keyboard, the terran looked especially mortal 
 inoryy: terran was weakest, yeah
 Gabbek: while we're on topic of bots - what are your initially thoughts what would be useful in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-of-the-realm">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-of-the-realm</a>&#160;? Initially I thought that going deep would yield quite good results, but from my testing it didn't really do as well as I thought it would
 inoryy: which is funny because it was the strongest for most of the training run
 Hjax: the protoss one had really great micro 
 Hjax: the zerg one just liked that ravager all in
 Hjax: boy did it like that ravager all in 
 Gabbek: building placement was a real biggie for alphastar
 Gabbek: if there's one thing I remember the most about its' terran playstyle :D
 inoryy: mid one failed spectacularily a few games, final was ok at placement
 Hjax: i wonder how many times final lost at blizzcon
 Hjax: since there were some mid agents mixed in 
 inoryy: &lt; 10 iirc
 Hjax: oriol confirmed that my first win (and advanced's first defeat in general) was vs final 
 Hjax: and i know serral was playing against it in his games 
 inoryy: couldn't go to blizzcon&#160;:( 
 Hjax:&#160;:(
 Hjax: it was cool to meet a lot of the team 
 Hjax: i talked to Timo a lot 
 inoryy: yeah, they were quite happy about meeting everyone and how the event went
 Hjax: when they announced the alphastar thing at the start of blizzcon 
 Hjax: i RAN there lol 
 Hjax: and spent most of blizzcon there
 Hjax: #worthit
 inoryy: haha
 Astrobytes: That's rather awesome.Slightly OT but any joy with recruiting some SC2 botters?
 Hjax: i havent asked yet, inorry and i are both admins in the sc2ai discord 
 Hjax: so im sure we can convince some people to play 
 Astrobytes: *force
 Astrobytes: :P
 inoryy: I vaguely hinted about it to Crypt but he didn't follow I think&#160;: D
 Gabbek: interesting :D that must have been cool on blizzcon, never been on such a big event
 inoryy: (not an admin there anymore btw)
 Hjax: admin in spirit!
 inoryy: alright, I'll take it&#160;:) 
 Astrobytes: transcended?&#160;:)
 inoryy: well it was a wild run, when I joined initially there were less than 10 people and I had no idea how to do RL and only barely had experience with DL for that matter
 Gabbek: I think one of the best AIs is probably AoE2HD? Bots are doing rather well against normal people and aren't cheating (sure - they don't stand a chance against pros, but in general it's pretty good)
 Gabbek: RL / DL stands for?
 inoryy: reinforcement learning / deep learning
 Astrobytes: Reinforcement Learning/Deep Learning
 Gabbek: ahh, right, thank you very much
 Astrobytes: ugh, too slow
 inoryy: too slow
 Gabbek: haha
 inoryy: bah
 Astrobytes: Hah, vengeance
 inoryy: lol
 Gabbek: Astrobytes that capitalization made you lose the first one :P
 Scarfield: afaik the AIs for aoe2 are written by the same one guy
 Astrobytes: Can't help it Gabbek! :D
 Scarfield: SpellStrobytes
 Astrobytes: Grammarfield
 Gabbek: Scarfield yeah I think so too, I think I remember it vaguely; spirit of the law made some video about the guy
 Scarfield: yea i think thats where i heard it&#160;:)
 Gabbek: I have quite bad memory, wish I would atleast remember more names!
 Gabbek: I remember reading somewhere that Battle Brothers (if any of you know this game) uses MCTS, but I'm not sure if it's true - but it would be quite nice surprise :D
 Scarfield: never heard of it, untill now i guess
 Astrobytes: MCTS is used as part of some game AI decision making in some games so it's possible
 Astrobytes: It's not like it's MCTS only though
 Gabbek: I've only tried MCTS once, in UTTT, at first in python - either I did some mistakes or it was just really bad :D
 Gabbek: slighty better in C#, but I should try to re-write in c++ one day, really enjoyable experience
 Scarfield: python is too slow to get any useful statistics for UTTT from MCTS
 Gabbek: by the way - any of you did some heavy website scrapping? What would be the best language for such a task?
 Hjax: python has lots of libraries for that sort of thing i think 
 Astrobytes: you can get good results for MCTS in C#, better in C++ yes but still good enough
 Astrobytes: python
 Gabbek: I've got a working solution but I initially thought it would be around 3k requests... well - it's about 300k; guess it'll be time to learn some async then :D 
 Gabbek: just gonna share this lovely link if anyone would like to learn something new: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/">https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/</a>
 Gabbek: there's java, python and kotlin, as well as tons of learning materials
 Gabbek: they are also giving out licences to all of their tools for personal use if you complete *no idea how much* content, which you might find useful&#160;:)
 inoryy: yeah JB are great
 inoryy: I'm considering buying a license even though I have it at work, just to support them
 Astrobytes: Looks interesting!
 Gabbek: inoryy I know the feeling, exactly what I did myself
 Astrobytes: meh, having one of those days where I feel like I should change careers again
 Astrobytes: Time to go offline methinks!
 Gabbek: but I must say that I'm not using much of pro features :D I don't do any web development, pretty much
 Gabbek: Astrobytes good night!
 Astrobytes: gn Gabbek, nice chatting with you
 inoryy: Astrobytes gn and hope tomorrow goes better!
 inoryy: Gabbek, nice! if you ever decide to give C++ a go then their CLion IDE is really good
 Gabbek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c4155c19-04e6-4586-8c32-6f9a3230c216">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c4155c19-04e6-4586-8c32-6f9a3230c216</a>
 Gabbek: woot
 Gabbek: is this what happens when your message is too long? :D
 Gabbek: inoryy do you know any decent place for learning some c++?
 ZarthaxX: inoryy my profile pic is from cotc, yes :P
 ZarthaxX: late response
 Gabbek: good night everyone!

 UNs2725: hi
 BeardedKitten_5f8d: I am used to seeing multi dimensional arrays written like this (Array[i][i]) I would be very appreciative if someone could explain how to access the full array. Thank you 
 BeardedKitten_5f8d: or how i can find the information
 C26_1: @BeardedKitten_5f8d, if you want to print an element that;s an array in multi dimesional Array then print(Array[n])
 C26_1: where n is an index
 C26_1: For example:[[3,4,5],[1,9,8]]
 C26_1: If you want to access [3,4,5] then print(Array[0])
 C26_1: It's like having a big boat contains small boat, and each of these small boats has some containers
 C26_1: It's some analogy of course, to have a better understanding about 2d-Array
 Sl0ppy: basically array[0] is also an array
 Sl0ppy: so u need array[0][0] to get to a value
 Sl0ppy: and if u want to access it all, u have to either use nested loops
 BeardedKitten_5f8d: nvm haha i feel like a buffoon i was interpreting the c# input[] as an multi dimensional array, which had me really puzzled, but now i realize its just putting out data
 Sl0ppy: actually idk if there is any other option besides nested loops
 Sl0ppy: got it
 BeardedKitten_5f8d: Thank you though

 derjack: :upside_down:
 xyh_from_China: @field3 What's that game?
 field3: It is Ataxx in PENDING CONTRIBUTION.
 field3: Proliferate or move your pieces. You can turn over the opponent piece of one square vertically, horizontally and diagonally from the destination or the breeding destination.
 Stilgart: csb is no more Automaton2000&#160;:(
 Automaton2000: i have to do a few more times
 Miki09: Can someone please help me with the minesweeper?
 Stilgart: have faith and spam submit
 Miki09: lol
 Stilgart: (and try to remove bugs in your code first)
 Miki09: Yeah
 Stilgart: ~50 submits should do the trick
 Miki09: I have reCaptcha now&#160;:)
 Miki09: You have reached the maximum of submissions in a row. Please try again in a few minutes.
 Miki09: lol
 Stilgart: ask Automaton2000 to anwser the captachas for you

 Sl0ppy: he was only 3 lvls old :cry:
 5DN1L: You're going to shed a lot of tears if you become a mod :thinking:

 Wontonimo: :taco: Astrobytes
 antiwonto: [automated] Wontonimo has awarded Astrobytes 10 tacos. Astrobytes now has 22 tacos. Wontonimo now has 33 tacos
 Wontonimo: thanks for pointing out the repeat Astro
 Astrobytes: woohoo
 Wontonimo: i see it in the logs&#160;;(
 Astrobytes: no worries, it did it last night too
 struct: time to add mod to that bot
 Wontonimo: it's looking for repeat from the same person in the same day.  need to change it to be the same person without someone else saying anything
 Astrobytes: both occasions there were active spammers, then it told off the wrong people :D
 Wontonimo: ha
 struct: maybe add a timestamp to when the player last tsaid the same message
 USSR_Chicken: hiii
 struct: It also happened to me yesterdafy
 5DN1L: yeah, timestamp is better
 Wontonimo: hey struct, i tried using mod commands with the bot from my account.  it doesn't work.  the mod feature is through the web
 Wontonimo: hi USSR_Chicken
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: did the chat logger get kicked again?
 struct: ah
 USSR_Chicken: so i made a discord bot but none of the commands are working
 Astrobytes: what are you using for your bot btw Wontonimo? I was thinking of making a 'help' bot
 struct: Automaton2020 should be up
 struct: I can tab it
 Astrobytes: was just gonna do it in python
 Wontonimo: i sent you the code Astrobytes
 Wontonimo: it's javascript
 Astrobytes: gotcha thx
 Wontonimo: it's the same connection code as Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what is the point where i am
 Astrobytes: ^ kinda profound
 Astrobytes: Much appreciated Wontonimo, will do a js and a python version since I need the js practice&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: right now though, back to boring stuff, see you all in a bit
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: 13 minesweeper solutions published in the last day, not bad
 emadUO4: new here
 BlaiseEbuth: Make a rtfm bot Astrobytes
 BlaiseEbuth: Or a lmgt one
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: and now a puzzle with unicode inputs.  weird string of puzzles
 Wontonimo: :wave: emadUO4
 C26_1: @Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker, About solutions of Minesweeper events, what would you rank the solutions overall?
 Wontonimo: you don't need to put the "@" in the front C26_1
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I haven't looked at them.  Somebody should run each of them 100 times and rank how well they do
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I guess that somebody is me or CG, I guess nobody else has access
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: not sure if they are planning to show them all to everybody, not sure how these events work
 USSR_Chicken: i figured out how to make my discord bot work!
 USSR_Chicken: out of all the code all it was missing was a comma
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 USSR_Chicken: now i can play minesweeper in discord lol
 USSR_Chicken: and now imma go code one to respectfully nuke discords
 USSR_Chicken: im gonna try to make it so it destroys one channel and it says "respectfully, im sorry"
 USSR_Chicken: but it will also have a 10s countdown which all of this will take a while but it is my next project
 C26_1: USSR_Chicken, maybe you can design a NUKE button to click whenever you want
 C26_1: And 10s countdown video after that
 USSR_Chicken: ah yes, make them more mad that i gave them plenty of time to kick it :joy:, after that "nuke" countdown and siren
 USSR_Chicken: then walla, one channel that says "respectfully, sorry" pop up lol
 ninjadip: cool now i got a good mine detector
 USSR_Chicken: nice
 ninjadip: next is to figure out where to go based off of detected mines vs unknowns?
 ninjadip: haven't read that far into strategy yet
 ninjadip: just glad the mine detection is working for simple patterns
 USSR_Chicken: :thumbs_up:
 USSR_Chicken: the emoji didnt work D:
 USSR_Chicken: oh but that one does
 USSR_Chicken: makes sense
 USSR_Chicken: anywho ima go work on that nuke bot
 ninjadip: maybe like if the tile says there are X nearby mines but i have detected the X nearby ones already and there is still one more unkinown, then that must NOT be a mine right?
 therealbeef: indeed
 ninjadip: Awesome, i'm on a good path
 ninjadip: ty
 Wontonimo: it is a constrain propagation problem.  there are other constraint problems here also ... like Wave Function Collapse :wink:
 therealbeef: haha shameless
 Wontonimo: yes :grin:.  But skipping the shameless part, you'll see in the write up of WFC a good method of keeping 2 data structures: patches and symbols

 DethHarmonik: Of course. It's a feature. ^^
 struct: ofc it is

 Ftyghi: hi
 Wontonimo: hello there new person Ftyghi
 Ftyghi: did you forget me

 Wontonimo: then you can use it to see if your next move is a win, and if not can you block the opponent forr a win.  that will beat wood
 Wontonimo: and struct, you don't need to save all previous boards either.  only boards with the same number of occupied spaces (since spaces cannot become unoccupied)
 darkhorse64: no because of jumps
 DethHarmonik: Someone: "hi"Wontonimo: "You just activated my trap card!"
 Wontonimo: do jumps remove pieces or change them
 darkhorse64: yes
 Wontonimo: which?
 struct: where it lands
 struct: all neighbors
 darkhorse64: ^
 Wontonimo: it changes, replaces, not removes.  there are no fewer pieces on the board
 Wontonimo: lol DethHarmonik
 darkhorse64: I see your point Wontonimo: you are right
 darkhorse64: good clue for updating a transposition table
 Wontonimo: i check their ranking DethHarmonik, and if they haven't reached top 2000 and have tried a multi, I give pointed direction to *go play that multi more*
 Wontonimo: weeds out the people who can't code and just wanna spam chat
 darkhorse64: give kids homework to keep them busy and avoid them getting nasty
 DethHarmonik: You're like the Google's profiling algo personified :scream:
 Wontonimo: not something i'll be able to do from discord&#160;;(

 darkhorse64: as late as possible can be a progress
 ninjadip: without reading anything out there
 ninjadip: huh
 struct: is there any benefit of having 3 fold repetition over 1 fold repetition?
 ninjadip: what is that
 struct: 1 repeition = the position repeats 1 time
 jacek: not really. in checkers durnig search if posiion repeats i assume its drawish

 DethHarmonik: Who are you calling normal?&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Quidome: you mean the spam level?

 Quidome: well not a big problem for me, but  it is visible

 Astrobytes: Yeah Quidome, it's nice for discussing ideas, brainstorming etc. And MSmits sermons of course
 Scarfield: long time since he has made a wall&#160;:/
 Scarfield: at least since i have seen on
 Scarfield: e
 Astrobytes: Not too long ago, he's real busy with school stuff, exams being postponed, moved around etc
 Wontonimo: i love the distraction from work this provides.  line none other
 Quidome: And I agree, a contest without a chat is no good
 Astrobytes: hehehe, CG: killing tech employee productivity worldwide
 Quidome: well we will see, thnxs for your thoughts
 Astrobytes: indeed&#160;:)
 Scarfield: if they will check for retention of users after removing world chat, and the retention drops (it will for me im sure), we can hope they will bring it back
 BlaiseEbuth: That's probably why they also plan to remove contests! :o
 Astrobytes: I doubt that highly Scarfield
 Scarfield: nooo...ooo
 BlaiseEbuth: You should now that their stats always say what they want them to say...
 antiwonto: how do you relate users back to CG accounts using discord?  :rolling_eyes:
 Quidome: Discord is also an option of course, but integrated is nice
 Astrobytes: Yeah I'm hoping this isn't a 'farewell' contest but, I'm grateful there is one regardless&#160;:)
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: blackmail
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't given my daily taco yet
 Scarfield: +1 astra
 eulerscheZahl: :taco: Quidome
 antiwonto: [automated] eulerscheZahl has awarded Quidome 10 tacos. Quidome now has 11 tacos. eulerscheZahl now has 22 tacos
 Scarfield: astro *
 Quidome: It would be really sad if they kill the contests
 antiwonto: and the tacos
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Time will tell. Still other contests elsewhere
 Quidome: :joy:
 Miki09: :taco: Wontonimo
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: time will tell, nah, time will show
 antiwonto: [automated] Miki09 has awarded Wontonimo 10 tacos. Wontonimo now has 43 tacos. Miki09 now has 1 tacos
 BlaiseEbuth: Only time will tell :musical_score:
 Astrobytes: Scarfield :taco:
 antiwonto: [automated] Astrobytes has awarded Scarfield 10 tacos. Scarfield now has 21 tacos. Astrobytes now has 23 tacos
 Scarfield: Astrobytes :taco:
 Scarfield: heey
 antiwonto: [automated] Scarfield has awarded Astrobytes 10 tacos. Astrobytes now has 33 tacos. Scarfield now has 22 tacos
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: I'm rolling in tacos now
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: kinda weird but okay
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: BlaiseEbuth :taco:
 antiwonto: [automated] Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker has awarded BlaiseEbuth 10 tacos. BlaiseEbuth now has 10 tacos. Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker now has 3 tacos
 Astrobytes: It's the Taco-bite Rebellion
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: hm
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth slaps Scarfield around with a :taco:</b>
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: how did this start?
 Scarfield: mmm
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh thx Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker
 Quidome: OK on minesweeper, I saw a suggestion from wontonimo on combing numbers to gain information when stuck
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: is that a Jacobite joke?  I;m sure all the 12yos got that :P
 Scarfield: how could this not be what CG wants on their site :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: At least someone did!!
 Quidome: I was thinking along the lines playing out what if questions will that work?
 Scarfield: i still dont get it
 jacek:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: Quidome did you check the forum? pardouin wrote a nice explanation for a specific case
 Astrobytes: The '45 Rebellion? Jacobite Uprising of 1745? Bonnie Prince Charlie?
 BlaiseEbuth: Hey Wontonimo there's 7 words in my message! Why can't I slap Scarfield with that taco! :rage:
 Quidome: aha, ok, going to look there
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: &lt;-&gt; wonder how many people the U.S. killed for no reason
 eulerscheZahl: of course there are still the bad cases like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/607425660">https://www.codingame.com/replay/607425660</a>
 Astrobytes: wonder how many users were banned for legitimate reasons...
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: someone finally published a c++ solution for frame the picture.  lots of tricky stuff to handle unicode
 eulerscheZahl: credits to fr chat for this replay
 Scarfield: no idea, history is not my thing
 Astrobytes: Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: don't you have to mess with locale methods and all that horrible stuff?
 BlaiseEbuth: Probably not so more than Japan...
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: yeah,  wcin .imbue(locale(""));
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: russia
 Astrobytes: Yep. All that stuff. Nightmare.
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: gulag
 BlaiseEbuth: Just survival camps...
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: the gulag was built in 1930
 KadonWills: ok
 DethHarmonik: Old survival camps
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: The Gulag was a system of Soviet labour camps and accompanying detention and transit camps and prisons. From the 1920s to the mid-1950s it housed political prisoners and criminals of the Soviet Union. At its height, the Gulag imprisoned millions of people.
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: The Gulag system ended definitively six years later on 25 January 1960, when the remains of the administration were dissolved by Khrushchev. ... The author likened the scattered camps to "a chain of islands", and as an eyewitness he described the Gulag as a system where people were worked to death.
 eulerscheZahl: no mods around?
 5DN1L: kicked
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: fine, i'll stop
 BlaiseEbuth: I prefer goulash anyway
 Astrobytes: Yes, you said that earlier
 Astrobytes: @eve
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: but that was for the quotes

 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: so if he's banned he can never chat again unless he has another existing account?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: hm
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 Astrobytes: It does, iirc
 antiwonto: BlaiseEbuth , i reduced max words to 5 ... sorry
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: that's not true
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: it is more like a timer
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. That's getting trickier... :thinking:
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i was banned (last time) for about few weeks at best
 Astrobytes: That'll be the server reset magic
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: who was that guy who always banned me?
 Astrobytes: Me
 Ziatzoraf: hello world
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: you?
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth slaps Astrobytes with :taco:</b>
 Astrobytes: Yes. When I was still a mod.
 antiwonto: [automated] BlaiseEbuth has awarded Astrobytes 10 tacos. Astrobytes now has 43 tacos. BlaiseEbuth now has 11 tacos
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: long time no see
 Astrobytes: Holy Taco!
 BlaiseEbuth: Can't even put a 'a'
 BlaiseEbuth: ...
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: well im gonna go sleep, night or day
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: it was nice seeing you asrobytes
 Astrobytes: See you in 10 minutes no doubt
 BlaiseEbuth: Hell... Already 43, you should rename Tacobytes.
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: dont be nice astrobytes, its prob 5 mins
 Scarfield: AstroTaco is not bad either
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: What should the #fr version give away?  
 antiwonto: baguette&#160;?
 Scarfield: free tacos
 BlaiseEbuth: tortues!
 5DN1L: why?
 Astrobytes: Pâté Hénaff obviously
 KadonWills: 2500$ lol:money_mouth:
 5DN1L: Reminder: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 5DN1L: No spam, or get kicked away
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I could stop with the tacos and start complaining about unicode again...
 Scarfield: my MCTS has 16 child nodes for 1st turn, one child has 168.816 visits out of 168.850, wonder if thats a bug :p
 antiwonto: need a higher UTF_C value maybe
 antiwonto: UCB_C 
 antiwonto: what's a utf_c&#160;?
 Astrobytes: unicode related?
 jacek: wtf_c
 BlaiseEbuth: Wild Turtles from France _ Corporation
 eulerscheZahl: how did they take the news of chat removal?
 jacek: who
 eulerscheZahl: fr chat
 BlaiseEbuth: Not as a news.
 Wontonimo: jacek UCB_C = upper confidence bound constant for MCTS
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: impossibru
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: but the new event system is based on chat
 eulerscheZahl: s/chat/discordezpz
 Astrobytes: I would assume they wish to remove the discussion to the forum for non-discorders
 <b>**eulerscheZahl will miss the webchat</b></p><p><img src="/a/73294709815061" /> Scarfield: RIP
 jacek: when they are going to delete it
 Scarfield: ^
 BlaiseEbuth: Somebody took a look to the discord? ust to know if the 'event' created more move than here
 Astrobytes: tbf, it would be a lot easier and quieter being a mod without it!
 Wontonimo: mod of nothing = easy job
 Wontonimo: and i just got my mod badge&#160;;(
 BlaiseEbuth: In mod we trust
 Astrobytes: discord + forum
 Wontonimo: i don't mod discord
 Wontonimo: i hardly use that other than for private chat
 Astrobytes: Ah, yeah, still you have The Power
 BlaiseEbuth: You'll be fired so...
 Wontonimo: they can try to claw back my pay
 Astrobytes: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Hop you didn't already spent all the insults you got...
 eulerscheZahl: i guess we'll find out how others coded their bots in the post mortes afterwards and not on chat, depending on how fast they will implement the change
 Astrobytes: I honestly hope for post-contest removal, but guess we have to wait and see 
 eulerscheZahl: fun fact: post mortes is the correct plural form
 Astrobytes: you and your Latin :D
 Astrobytes: What did the Romans ever do for us eh
 eulerscheZahl: lingua Latina meque
 Astrobytes: You like talking to Latinas?
 jacek: quidquid Latine dictum sit, altum videtur
 Scarfield: seems it was a backpropagate issue, might actually work now
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 BlaiseEbuth: Latin is a dead language since a drunk roman summoned me by trying to sing...
 jacek: passing moves backpropagate?
 Astrobytes: usually sign errors in backprop!
 Scarfield: i havent tested yet if passing moves work, but they should :fingerscrossed:
 jacek: fingerfield
 Astrobytes: Scarfinger.
 Scarfield: xD could have sworn i had seen a crossed fingers emoji
 BlaiseEbuth: crossedfield
 Astrobytes: :fingers_crossed:
 BlaiseEbuth: crossesfield
 Scarfield: i knew it, couldnt see it when i scrolled through them.. that eye surgery
 Astrobytes: gotta add the '_'
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 BlaiseEbuth: Scarface so
 Scarfield: thats half of the origin of my nick, you will never guess the other half
 BlaiseEbuth: cloverfield
 Scarfield: yellow cat related
 BlaiseEbuth: garfield
 Astrobytes: Definitely not Garfield
 Scarfield: ding ding ding
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/imsorryjon/">https://www.reddit.com/r/imsorryjon/</a>
 Scarfield: is that sub even sfw?
 Astrobytes: It's Tuesday, at least he's happy
 jacek: everything is sfw
 Scarfield: true, havent had lasagna in a long time though&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: lo, that sub is... intriguing
 Astrobytes: *lol, I'm not talking in ye olde Englishe
 BlaiseEbuth: ngl
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Of harmes two the lesse is for to cheese.
 Astrobytes: Chaucer! Jeez
 Quidome: I found all the mines but the test case is still red
 Quidome: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/607495448">https://www.codingame.com/replay/607495448</a>
 eulerscheZahl: how many mines are these?
 eulerscheZahl: 99 or more?
 eulerscheZahl: top right corner
 Scarfield: i can see at least 2 mistakes top right bottom left
 eulerscheZahl: you have a 3 with 4 cells around
 eulerscheZahl: and maybe on the very left too, not sure
 eulerscheZahl: there's a cell with no neighbor revealed
 Quidome: hm, that's interesting
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i maximized the board and missed Scarfield
 eulerscheZahl: sorry
 Quidome: I misinterpreted the 099 nu,ber
 eulerscheZahl: 99 missing
 Quidome: ok, not good, thnxs
 eulerscheZahl: will go down to 0 when you place flags
 Quidome: Yes, but that was purely visible but maybe still helpful&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: but you have to reveal all non-mines. flags are just "comments"
 Quidome: So you HAVE to place flags
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: but it help you to debug when you are done
 Quidome: yes, I see, thnxs
 Quidome: going to do that first
 Scarfield: after looking again, it seems you only need to "click" (29,0). (0,12) has to be a bomb, so close
 eulerscheZahl: the 5 at the top right has 6 neighbors
 Scarfield: lol yea, but at least 0,12 cant be a bomb, so that leaves the top right
 eulerscheZahl: did you count them?
 Scarfield: sigh, there could be a 5 at 0,12
 Scarfield: xD ill stop trying to help
 Quidome: Testcase in the green for the first time with flags :D
 Scarfield: im confusing myself even more now, can there be a bomb without any numbers around it? because if not, then 0,12 has to be a 5 ie not a bomb?
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 jacek: this is real minefield
 Scarfield: we killed the chat before they even removed it :o
 xxx_newbiehackerxz: what
 xxx_newbiehackerxz: im new
 xxx_newbiehackerxz: can yoyu teach me
 struct: how much does the tt slow the code usualy?
 jacek: hmm i get 500-600k moves with tt and 750k-850k without
 jacek: but less depth without tt
 jacek: i use unordered_map and typical hashing than zobrist
 struct: ok I need to figure it out
 struct: I get 5x worse performance
 jacek: you want tt for minimax or 3-fold repetition?
 struct: 3 fold repetition
 jacek: oh, i checked only minimax. i dont have 3 fold repetition detection yet
 jacek: but for checkers and chess i clear tt after non-reversible move
 struct: Oh I fixed
 struct: my hash was terrible&#160;:)
 struct: maybe not
 jacek: stop smokng
 struct: Do you also store the game state on the map jacek?
 jacek: just hash
 struct: so you ignore collisions??
 jacek: for my purposes there are (almost) no collisions
 jacek: even so, if i store best reply there, i still check if the move is valid
 struct: I see, Im checking for collisions that might be one of the problems
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i wanna make a bot that says just quotes
 5DN1L: aren't you the bot that says just quotes?
 Chickins:&#160;?
 Scarfield: definately didnt implement pass moves correct xD well, thats for tomorrow, gn folks
 struct: gn
 Ben_Sundheim: gn
 One-Six: hey guys, am I allowed to plug a WIP CoC contribution in world chat?
 Wontonimo: no
 Wontonimo: feel free to plug it to your friends though
 One-Six: ok. Looks like they get more care as it approach end of 30 day though, guess I'll just be patient
 Astrobytes: it's a big list
 Wontonimo: yes, that's a good idea
 struct: yeah usual it gets more views the closer it is to the deadline
 struct: Unless its bot programming or optimization 
 Wontonimo: then it gets all kinds of early love
 struct: its interesting that I dont need to tell my bot to not fill the board if the fill would lose
 struct: It will just keep repeating moves unaware that it will end in a draw by repetition
 C26_1: Hello everyone
 struct: hi
 C26_1: So I have an idea
 C26_1: I'm gonna test if there's something that SQL cannot do as Excel
 One-Six: it that because bot and optimization are challanging and rare?
 C26_1: One-Six, game coding is hard,
 struct: One-Six they require a bit more effort in general
 Astrobytes: One-Six: pretty much, plus the above. It's more effort required from author and player
 struct: But if you do contributions similar to mine they dont require much effor
 struct: effort*
 One-Six: XD
 struct: You only need a few hours
 Astrobytes: 1. Copy nearest matching board game2. Rewrite the rules.3.&#160;???4. Profit
 One-Six: XDD
 struct:  thats what I did
 Astrobytes: Hey it works, and there's a nice variety too
 struct: I think 5 times now?
 One-Six: Guess I know what I should try to do in another two contributions XD
 struct: Yavalath, Yinsh, Othello, Amazons and now Ataxx
 Astrobytes: Something like that yeah struct :D
 C26_1: Copy-paste is the best skill that programmer should have XDD
 One-Six: I have a simple idea that can probably turn into two CoC and one Puzzle, so I will do that first
 C26_1: I mean why would waste hours of hours just to make code that's already in source-code mode and online
 struct: I still dont know what to expect from backgammon 
 One-Six: (The last one I need to do more research though
 struct: Isnt it too luck based? I dont know much about the game
 struct: I know its played on new york parks
 struct: But thats about it
 One-Six: I think anything that heavily utilize dices should be more luck based?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, there is dice rolling involved, but there might be some virtue to having it
 struct: Im sure there is some strategy to it
 One-Six: I always learn and forget about how backgammon works
 One-Six: xd
 Astrobytes: Yes, there is. And games involving chance are a special case for AI
 One-Six: ah...
 Astrobytes: Also many variants of it too
 Noneoneoneone: heyo
 Noneoneoneone: hows everyone doing/
 elderlybeginner: This event thing (minesweeper) - I don't see it to be different then other puzzles. Am I wrong?
 Astrobytes: It's the same yeah
 elderlybeginner: is there anything specific in regards to events?
 elderlybeginner: beside some new marketing
 Astrobytes: There will be bot-programming ones, and a clash one soon
 Astrobytes: Other than that it's just as you said
 Astrobytes: I think there is more solution-sharing than normal
 One-Six: wooooh
 struct: Is there any way to create a template for shifts?
 struct: Im not very familiar with templates
 dunky_: joe
 dunky_: new to the community
 dunky_: finishing up ASCII art
 Noneoneoneone: ascii art is a thinker
 Wontonimo: looked at minesweeper.  coded a random bot.  thought about making an algo... got tired 
 Wontonimo: congrats dunky_
 Wontonimo: what are you woking on now?
 struct: Wontonimo you can always try ataxx, we need someone to dethrone jacek
 Wontonimo: haha ... it won't be me
 Wontonimo: jacek will just up his game when he sees someone coming
 Wontonimo: my CG game isn't good enough to beat you or jacek
 struct: im only "good" at bot programming
 struct: and usually I dont do anything smart beside the sim
 struct: Make sim fast, bruteforce, profit
 Wontonimo: how's the NN stuff going?
 struct: I paused it for a bit during backpropagation
 struct: its a bit confusing
 dmuraco: what's for dinner?
 dooge: eheheh
 dooge: aahahahahhahah
 dooge: l
 dooge: ll
 koiee: hi
 koiee: how can we get harder questions in private clash
 ASM_MOV_INT: ...there is no way to determine or select difficulty in the clashes, as far as I've ever known
 ASM_MOV_INT: the rating system helps them determine that behind the scenes for the selection process

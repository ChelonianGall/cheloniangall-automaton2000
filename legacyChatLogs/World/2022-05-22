 Brawler_zx: The questions are tough 
 Brawler_zx: so i think thats the reason
 jacek: questions?
 Brawler_zx: i meant challenges
 PatrickMcGinnisII: LOCM: constructed is a challenge ...smh
 Brawler_zx: you are attempting it?
 Brawler_zx: I shut off my computer after seeing that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 300+ lines of code and I'm still deck building
 Brawler_zx: F
 jacek: typical magic the gathering eh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Not as complex, but still a pain.  Debating doing a brutal
 jacek: :scream:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I didn't go far enough with the original LOCM
 jacek: Automaton2000 what are your cards?
 Automaton2000: how many games do you like that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: kill me Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it is just the first thing i did in the past

 PatrickMcGinnisII: rabbit poop
 jacek: Oo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 thinks we are :poop:
 Automaton2000: so i wanted to try a nn for it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 follow the $
 Automaton2000: that's a lot of code

 TINOUAINANI: hi guys any one here love math , ihave a problem :joy:
 geppoz: go for it
 TINOUAINANI: ok, 1/a = 1/x1 + 1/x2 , need to find all numbers x1 and x2 that fiting the above equation and great than a
 TINOUAINANI: ps&#160;: any solution include i++ not working (time out)
 TINOUAINANI: this come from "Unit Fractions" puzzel
 TINOUAINANI: ohh , i find it :grin:
 TINOUAINANI: i didnt :sweat_smile:
 5DN1L: try rearranging the terms to see what are the limits i.e. the range of values that you really need to test
 TINOUAINANI: the range goes up to 10821720756 so no way for tisting evry single number , there is a pattern in the numbers
 5DN1L: yes, that's why i made the above suggestion to reduce the range of values
 TINOUAINANI: yes yes i am locking for it
 5DN1L: You can guess the range by merely looking at the expected outputs, but to understand why the range is like that, you have to do some algebra
 TINOUAINANI: i frogat that we code i code a programe that look for a pattern in expected outputs
 TINOUAINANI: :joy:
 5DN1L: not necessary helpful in every case, but in this case it is helpful
 aCatAI: hi bowwowforeach - what algo did you use for spring challenge 21 (trees game) - was it beamsearch / chokudai?
 aCatAI: (i'm preparing slides for presentation and gather info)
 TINOUAINANI: done finally i het math :joy:
 5DN1L: :joy:
 TINOUAINANI: our job is to code not math :joy:
 5DN1L: well you can choose to skip some puzzles here :wink:
 TINOUAINANI: i will do all puzzles
 5DN1L: then be prepared for more maths puzzles :smirk:
 TINOUAINANI: is there more of this :scream:
 5DN1L: of course there is

 Glyptod0n: hello, anyone can tell me what the + do in this line of python:
 Glyptod0n: or a name for its use so i can look it up

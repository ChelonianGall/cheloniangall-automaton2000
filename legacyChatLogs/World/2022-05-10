 Ryanless: hi, can someone point me to some good ressource about multiagent system?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Ryanless, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 Ryanless: also what can I do with the tacos?
 Urutar: You can either give other people tacos (:taco: [NAME], needs atleast 3) and receive some in the process; or you can eat them (eat :taco:, uses 10 each time) to increase one of your stats; or you can shakedown [NAME] to shake some tacos out of them if your stats are higher (only if they have atleast 50); or you can huntdown :taco:
 Urutar: You need atleast 3 to shake down aswell
 Ryanless: increase my stats?
 Urutar: Yeah, strength for example (there are a few)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eat :taco:
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 Urutar: Does anyone have any more suggestions or feedback for my submission?

 5DN1L: ok, that's quite enough, guys
 5DN1L: if anyone needs help, please specify the name of the puzzle, what you have tried, and what problem you're facing
 ZndrBrok: Hi guys&#160;! Do u use o/ here to say hello&#160;?
 ZndrBrok: Or it's a french thing :P
 ZndrBrok: o/
 5DN1L: you can, i see some use that
 ZndrBrok: Ok, i was just curious
 ZndrBrok: :P
 ZndrBrok: How is the Entry Code for everybody&#160;?
 ZndrBrok: I finnally have a working code but i still need to study him and change a little bit :P
 tugrul512bit: I'm still trying to understand the question. What is digit x=2? Binary code? Then x=10 means decimal?
 ZndrBrok: For entry code, yeah&#160;?
 tugrul512bit: Then I understood it right. Thanks.
 ZndrBrok: no
 ZndrBrok: wait
 ZndrBrok: i will explain&#160;!
 tugrul512bit: So when they say x^n &lt; 1000 it is 1000 in decimal and 8 in binary.
 ZndrBrok: x == 2 mean that u can use {0, 1} digits in your code
 ZndrBrok: n is the size of the code
 ZndrBrok: if u have x == 3 &amp; n == 3 
 ZndrBrok: u can use digits 0,1 &amp; 2
 tugrul512bit: Ok thank you
 ZndrBrok: to make a 3 digit code
 ZndrBrok:&#160;;)
 ZndrBrok: U need to dive into eulidian paths to help yourself with this one&#160;!
 ZndrBrok: But maybe there is another way too&#160;?
 tugrul512bit: Maybe brute-force works?
 ZndrBrok: The problems is not to have the code
 ZndrBrok: But you need to have a de Bruijn sequence
 ZndrBrok: for your output
 ZndrBrok: and it need to be the smallest one
 ZndrBrok: :P
 tugrul512bit: Does this problem also require high performance?
 ZndrBrok: It's not just a code breaking problem :P
 tugrul512bit: I'm gonna try simple approach with simdified code first.
 j4at: I found O(n) solution. I don't even know what is a de Bruijn sequence.
 ZndrBrok: I would say yes, a "friend" of my had a first code who passed only the first two but was to slow for the rest
 tugrul512bit: I guess C++ compiler of codingame supports AVX2
 ZndrBrok: If you have the correct output u have a debruijn sequence :P
 ZndrBrok: Even if u don't understand/know it
 j4at: okay&#160;:)
 tugrul512bit: Is the target of problem to teach people debrujin sequence?
 ZndrBrok: Hard to say :P U can see that j4at don't even know that name :P
 ZndrBrok: But for me yeah
 ZndrBrok: I am studying eulidian paths and de bruijn sequence hardly
 ZndrBrok: hjahaha
 tugrul512bit: Can we also use multiple threads?
 tugrul512bit: Are servers shared or dedicated?
 ZndrBrok: mmm...
 ZndrBrok: good question
 ZndrBrok: :P
 ZndrBrok: I don't know :P
 tugrul512bit: :D
 ZndrBrok: Need to wait for the answer of a cg magician :P
 ZndrBrok: I am just a walking noob :P
 tugrul512bit: :sweat_smile: me not a pro 
 j4at: Well, never saw anyone uses mutithreads
 tugrul512bit: I'm gonna try hard with threads &amp; simd and if I die I will let you know.
 Jerrasterix: nope Its single threaded afaik
 ZndrBrok: j4at 
 ZndrBrok: What language u used for the event&#160;?
 j4at: python
 ZndrBrok: I am curious of your solution
 ZndrBrok: Okok
 j4at: My solution is O(n) so it doesn't matter
 ZndrBrok: I repeat, it can matter :P
 ZndrBrok: At least if i listen to the chat :P
 ZndrBrok: my firned are runng time errors for the biggest ones
 ZndrBrok: his code worked only with the two first :P
 tugrul512bit: might be i/o latency
 tugrul512bit: std::cout slow I heard
 tugrul512bit: std::endl means death I heard
 Jerrasterix: ofc
 Jerrasterix: Its always better to use C func for output
 j4at: Well you need to lower time complexity instead of trying to optimize your current implementation
 j4at: Most people used recursion and was fast enough in python to solve the problem so you might to try that.
 cvrsed: slay what u wanna slay
 ZndrBrok: k
 wasmi: hoq do i play all my codes are wrong
 Ayza: well ask yourself why is it wrong
 Ayza: is it your coding skills, problem solving skills, or other
 Ayza: or perhaps you didn't understand the statement
 ZndrBrok: wasmi
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey ZndrBrok, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 5 tacos

 Scarfield: you can also use s.substr(i,1)

 kritkode: thank

 kritkode: now i can finally reach my max potential :triumph:
 Astrobytes: "ClockSortOrange" :rofl:
 ClockSort: for the Entry Code puzzle, I think you just need to use a De Bruijn sequence. See page 188 here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf">https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf</a>
 Scarfield: started learning german on duolingo, apparently Eule means "owl" in german
 kritkode: the clockwork orange by malcom mcdowell
 ClockSort: (or page 178 if you look at the actual page numbers)
 Scarfield: thanks for the link, but i like starting out trying myself with no help, saved link though&#160;:)
 ClockSort: ClockSort is my own sorting algorithm which sorts a list using only a clock. Something like this:
 ClockSort: while(!isSorted(list)) { sleep(1000); }
 ClockSort: it relies on bitrot to eventually sort the list
 Scarfield: energy effecient
 Astrobytes: excellent work :P
 Scarfield: all that sleeping
 jacek: stalin sort is more efficient, O(n) only
 ClockSort: what's really great is that it's fully parallelizable
 ClockSort: if you have two threads sleeping, it sorts twice as quickly
 Scarfield: i wish i could sleep in parrallel
 struct: I should be able to write the statement with 30 days

 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/COmw2x.jpg">https://snipboard.io/COmw2x.jpg</a>i present to you: EulescheZahl
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Scarfield: Do you want to explain the rules in statement, or just link to a "rulebook"?
 Astrobytes: lol, no rules or descriptions just "Google it"
 Scarfield: for an existing board game, its fair i think. chess doesnt have rules explained
 Astrobytes: lol, no I get ya. I just think "Google it" would be hilarious
 Scarfield: statement could be something like: "Backgammon is a racing game, you are playing against your opponent to be the one who first gets all their pieces off the board." LINK
 Scarfield: sure xD
 Scarfield: lmgtfy.com/backgammon_rules or something
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: whats wrong with current statement?
 jacek: You lose if:You mess up.You do not supply a valid sequence of actions.
 Scarfield: "You mess up" should suffice
 jacek: "You can submit at any time to recieve a score against the training validators". w00t, official CG sdk has typo?
 struct: oh I messed up
 struct: I made 300 viewer frames limit
 struct: instead of 300 outputs
 struct:&#160;:/
 Scarfield: cieve is deer in spanish, maybe the meen re-deer
 Astrobytes: :door:
 struct: what happens if I reach 300 outputs and the game is not decided?
 struct: Should the player with more stones removed win?
 struct: I dont think this will happen though 
 struct: with strong bots
 Scarfield: i think it would be "pip" score that should decide it
 jacek: pip?
 Astrobytes: pip install score
 jacek: there are points in this game, so use points eh
 Scarfield: it piece is some cells away from "home", that is the pip-value of the piece, add them up for each piece to get pip score
 Scarfield: it piece = each
 struct: So I need to create a rule
 struct:&#160;:/
 Scarfield: pips or pip count it seem to be called
 Scarfield: its used to give a general idea of who is ahead, but of course there will be exeptions. but i think pip count is a better approximation of who is winning than piece count
 Scarfield: 4 pieces 1 cell from home, or 1 piece 20 cells from home
 Scarfield: who is winning
 struct: hmm you tell me
 struct: I dont play this game
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: pip count is better if you ask me. in that example 4 pieces at 1 cell from home is garanteed to finish in at most 2 turns. 1 piece at 20 cells could be up to 7 turns with incredible "luck". (conscecutive 2 and 1 dice)
 Astrobytes: Agreed. It's a little weird since there is always a winner in backgammon so you don't need this kind of rule, but that seems fair
 jacek: or go the easy way and its a draw after 300 moves
 jacek: question is, can 1 player force to prolong the game easily?
 Scarfield: you can prolong, buts its expensive in pip count
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bkgm.com/rules/rul-faq.html">https://bkgm.com/rules/rul-faq.html</a>
 Scarfield: you can make what is called a "prime" in this link, but you have to move your own pieces when its your turn, so i dont think you can easily prolong game
 jacek: do you play backgammon
 Scarfield: yes
 jacek: for money?
 Scarfield: paypal?
 Scarfield: no
 Scarfield: my friends dad is actually a coach on the DK nactionals backgammon team, i can ask him. but i dont think you can reliably prolong the game
 jacek: noice
 Scarfield: struct 300 moves for each player or combined?
 struct: yes
 struct: no 300 moves
 struct: 300 outputs
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 struct: so 300*4 if you roll 4 dices everytime
 Scarfield: oh
 Scarfield: thats weird.. hmm
 struct: why?
 Scarfield: just how to ask the backgammon coach a decent question
 jacek: "why did you waste your life on a board game?"
 Scarfield: i will just assume 1/6 turns will be double dice, 125 turns per player then
 BattleCastle_898f: lol
 BattleCastle_898f: mine is bugged out

 5DN1L: don't do that again, or you'll get kicked
 ZndrBrok: i should learn to read...
 5DN1L: yup
 ZndrBrok: Sry Sensei&#160;! I was just wondering if i have dreamd or not :P
 5DN1L: ok
 jacek: lucid dreaming eh
 BattleCastle_898f: yep im still getting the same error message
 BattleCastle_898f: is anyone here?
 BattleCastle_898f:&#160;?
 BattleCastle_898f:&#160;?
 BattleCastle_898f:&#160;?/
 itstaylor: no
 bingler: It's time to yeet.
 bingler: Come on, boys! Let's yeet - together!
 waterproofsodium: "win 3 shortest clashes"
 waterproofsodium: I never get gold coding speed
 Wontonimo: antiwonto, are you alive?
 Wontonimo: antiwonto
 antiwonto: [auto] 'antiwonto' was defined as ' A bot, possibly assembled in Central America. Programming questionable '
 derjack: :taco: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but i cant be sure
 antiwonto: [auto] derjack has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 51 taco. derjack now has 48 taco
 Automaton2000: so there is no spoon
 Wontonimo: hmm...
 Wontonimo: :taco: Automation2000
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 derjack:&#160;!!
 Wontonimo: oh, i spelt it wrong
 Wontonimo: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] Automaton2000 is a bot.  Bots don't eat tacos
 Automaton2000: what does the selection look like
 Automaton2000: yes i can see the validators
 Wontonimo: :taco: antiwonto
 antiwonto: [auto] That's a bot.  Bots don't eat tacos
 Westicles: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 waterproofsodium: toca
 Manchi_o6o7: Someone awake maybe?
 Gumarkamole: haha, yeah
 ZndrBrok: waterproofsodium Really&#160;?
 ZndrBrok:&#160;:(
 ZndrBrok: I use C#...
 ZndrBrok: i will never get ther neither in this "python" world&#160;:(
 ZndrBrok: It's not fair /Flip
 ZndrBrok: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 waterproofsodium: yapp
 waterproofsodium: same
 waterproofsodium: can't beat shortest mode
 waterproofsodium: can't even ommit class name and Main
 waterproofsodium: like in modern C#
 Pux03: hello
 Pux03: im new to programming
 Pux03: &lt;3
 Laki_42: no, he is not
 Pux03: who are you?
 waterproofsodium: gets so boring spending 3min minifying code zz
 waterproofsodium: you're kidding me
 waterproofsodium: some dude got place 2 because of 1 character difference
 waterproofsodium: also lovely to know shortest mode encourages use of deprecated features
 ZndrBrok: We need to push them to implement .NET 6 magic :P
 waterproofsodium: yes!
 waterproofsodium: or just remove shortest mode&#160;;)
 ZndrBrok: I will maybe create a post about it on the forum tomorow
 ZndrBrok: haha
 waterproofsodium: cause I still would not have gotten a better place with net 6
 ZndrBrok: Remove from the XP path at least yeah
 ZndrBrok: With C# against pythons it derve at least legend :P
 waterproofsodium: it just makes no sense
 Astrobytes: they're only updating languages required for Codingame for Work (the business side), most likely C# will not be updated any time soon
 ZndrBrok:&#160;:(
 waterproofsodium: like if people hire from this site it's just a useless drawback for everyone using a language they're comfortable with
 Astrobytes: Was confirmed just before the contest when they updated most languages
 waterproofsodium: when is score updated again?
 ZndrBrok: So we need to learn python especially for get gold :P
 waterproofsodium: thought it was exactly this hour
 Astrobytes: another 30 mins or 1 hour iirc
 waterproofsodium: ah it just did
 waterproofsodium: yay
 waterproofsodium: 3 points up :D
 Astrobytes: ah
 ZndrBrok: My update if i see good
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 waterproofsodium: 3 points is much ngl
 waterproofsodium: tho yesterday it was 40 points
 waterproofsodium: so meaning it's already a up and down thing instead of steady progress
 Astrobytes: clash points decay quickly too
 waterproofsodium: meaning I am likely not going to improve my score without a lot of training xD
 ZndrBrok: :taco: waterproofsodium
 waterproofsodium: oh lord decay&#160;:(
 ZndrBrok: I see that taco bot is off&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: taco bot is run from wonto's personal machine, so it's on when he is
 ZndrBrok: Aaaa
 ZndrBrok: This explain a lot :P
 ZndrBrok: I tried today to invoc him 4 times
 ZndrBrok: and i almost get kicked by another mod :P
 ZndrBrok: Not everybody like tacos
 Astrobytes: he was active again earlier but not for long&#160;:)
 waterproofsodium: think I gonna try doing clash daily for 2 - 3 months
 waterproofsodium: big hope I will notice getting more efficient
 Astrobytes: did you try the multiplayer bot programming/optim games?
 waterproofsodium: I see little value in those
 ZndrBrok: I speak with u and i forgot i am in a clash...
 ZndrBrok:&#160;:/
 waterproofsodium: think the other problems are better for practice
 Astrobytes: More value in puzzles than clashes tbh
 waterproofsodium: depends
 Astrobytes: clashes are supposed to just be for fun, though opinions vary
 waterproofsodium: I mean it is a big difference whether you need 5x longer for a typical clash problem
 waterproofsodium: it's not like you can't learn from solutions of other people
 Astrobytes: clash is about remembering the clashes you had before and being quick, and writing illegible horrible golfed code :D
 waterproofsodium: remembering?
 Astrobytes: sure
 waterproofsodium: do they repeat?
 Astrobytes: Yup
 waterproofsodium: I never had a single rpetition
 waterproofsodium: oh well in that case that's a problem
 waterproofsodium: how many problems are there in total?
 waterproofsodium: anyways it's not that much of a problem
 Astrobytes: there's a few thousand of them iirc
 waterproofsodium: i mean a few thousands...
 waterproofsodium: don't tell me you remember more than 20% of them well..
 Astrobytes: 1.5 to 2K I think
 Astrobytes: I don't clash these days
 waterproofsodium: was there ever a time when you remembered a good share of the problems?
 waterproofsodium: remembering in detail
 Astrobytes: But yeah, a lot of people clash a lot and remember the problems (or even they type of problem, since there are many duplicates in terms of the actual problem)
 waterproofsodium: kk
 Astrobytes: I never clashed enough to get that far, I'm here for the other stuff&#160;:)
 waterproofsodium: I feel I have a great learning experience from clash
 waterproofsodium: but puzzles I would have likely too. I plan to try them more soon
 Astrobytes: there are some great puzzles tbh
 waterproofsodium: defiintely
 waterproofsodium: there are also some great clashes&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: hehehe, of course
 Wontonimo: :taco: Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: hey Wontonimo
 Wontonimo:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: hey Astrobytes&#160;!
 Wontonimo: :taco: Astrobytes 
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has awarded Astrobytes 10 tacos. Astrobytes now has 52 taco. Wontonimo now has 40 taco
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 Wontonimo: I think antiwonto died when I put my laptop to sleep an hour ago
 Wontonimo: had to kick it awake just now
 Wontonimo: it's about time I get my pi out and run antiwonto on it.  a dedicated 'server' 
 waterproofsodium: Astrobytes interesting score graph in your profile
 Astrobytes: crowdfund a server for him
 waterproofsodium: did you spend much time on this site?
 waterproofsodium: (not in total, but on a daily basis)
 Astrobytes: You could say that :D
 Astrobytes: Used to be a moderator
 waterproofsodium: oh. I mean with learning
 Wontonimo: i've learnt stuff here
 Wontonimo: which i really didn't expect
 Astrobytes: I learned a ton on here yeah, had to go off and discover search algorithms and whatnot for starters
 Wontonimo: I also learnt that I was full of myself and this site was very humbling.  Glad it happened
 waterproofsodium: hm so you all mostly agree the real difficult algorithms are the real deal?
 Wontonimo: what do you mean?
 waterproofsodium: he spoke of "search algorithms" and you about "humbling experience"
 waterproofsodium: so assuming this means you both learned a lot things you didn't know about initially
 Wontonimo: i already knew about search.  What humbled me is the depth of optimization
 waterproofsodium: isn't that always done with special algorithms for a problem?
 waterproofsodium: *mostly
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I knew *of* the algorithms but had no clue about implementing them, and as wonto says, the optimisation part is something else
 Wontonimo: I'd written game AI before, like checkers and stuff
 Wontonimo: what I learnt here was how to make it go doggy fast
 Astrobytes: sure, perfect information and turn-based games work nicely with minimax/alphabeta or MCTS, continuous games with GA or MCTS variants etc etc
 Astrobytes: the 50-100ms  time limit really pushes you
 Wontonimo: totally
 waterproofsodium: nice
 Wontonimo: and what pushed me was to see just how many people were above me... at everywhere I've worked I've been "the optimization guy" so to see myself so far down the ladder was ... brutal
 Astrobytes: ...but healthy&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: yes, healthy
 Wontonimo: I've definitely been more humble at work since
 waterproofsodium: hm so locally you were an expert but globally not so much?
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: anyway, nice chatting with you all but I need to get some sleep
 waterproofsodium: have a good night
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 3 puzzles today, I'm done too
 Astrobytes: and you&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: hi and bye Patrick :wave:
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII tips his hat</b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> waterproofsodium: 3 puzzles nice
 Wontonimo: me too.  well not sleep, i've gotta get to work
 waterproofsodium: i probably wish I would have done 3 puzzles instead of a couple clashes
 Wontonimo: :wave: PatrickMcGinnisII
 waterproofsodium: but that's why I do clashes too cause I'm just more motivated for them currently
 Wontonimo: that's the trick waterproofsodium, do the part that motivates you
 Wontonimo: later
 waterproofsodium: sometimes maybe
 waterproofsodium: sometimes it's the right thing tho to stay motivated to do anything
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops, accidentally did another puzzle
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Rocket Engines...lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only 21 mnore to lvl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er more
 PatrickMcGinnisII: darn can't do math... 20 more
 <b>**ZndrBrok happy that he can finly give a  :taco: to waterproofsodium</b>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: laterz
 waterproofsodium: hmmmmmmm
 waterproofsodium: now I'm confused
 ZndrBrok: :taco: waterproofsodium
 antiwonto: [auto] ZndrBrok has awarded waterproofsodium 9 tacos. waterproofsodium now has 17 taco. ZndrBrok now has 10 taco
 waterproofsodium: was later part of his sentence, or was it "see you later"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: laterz...yes
 ZndrBrok: I need to write an algo for that :P
 waterproofsodium: I mean Wontonimo
 waterproofsodium: thank you for 9 takos :D
 ZndrBrok: np 
 ZndrBrok: After almost getting kicked for trying to give them
 ZndrBrok: i am more than happy haha
 ZndrBrok: Now u can send 5 bitcoins on my special wallet
 ZndrBrok: :cherries:
 waterproofsodium: I cannot do that
 ZndrBrok:&#160;:(
 waterproofsodium: can send you 9 tacocoin tho
 ZndrBrok: send some sodium&#160;?
 waterproofsodium: they're worth $0.00001 ea
 ZndrBrok: Mmm... Not worth creating a wallet :P
 ZndrBrok: Hope i will not regreat it in 10 years haha
 waterproofsodium: there's also a 0.00001% chance they'll be wroth $1M in a year
 waterproofsodium: now you gotta say:
 waterproofsodium: not worth calculating the risk :P
 ZndrBrok: I still can't forget 14 bitcoins that i just loost because i didn't care about them :P
 ZndrBrok: The where wortless thoo
 ZndrBrok: but now...
 waterproofsodium: oh lord
 waterproofsodium: jesus mary
 ZndrBrok: :tired_face:
 ZndrBrok: I was smart enough to dig them when u could do that on a potato computer
 ZndrBrok: but i was not smart enought to understand what they will become :P
 ZndrBrok: Op the end i stoped mining because used electricity was worth more hahahaha
 ZndrBrok: ANd i forgot about the 14,... that i had :P
 waterproofsodium: how did they get lost?
 ZndrBrok: I just forgot about them
 ZndrBrok: Changed computer in time
 waterproofsodium: so they still exist :thinking:
 ZndrBrok: never secured them
 ZndrBrok: :P
 ZndrBrok: Somewhere :p
 ZndrBrok: In the void
 ZndrBrok: If a hacker didn't find a way to eat them :P
 waterproofsodium: i mean you deleted/threw your hdd?
 waterproofsodium: threw away*
 ZndrBrok: Nooo
 ZndrBrok: but it was like 10 years ago bro
 waterproofsodium: so how did they get lost?
 waterproofsodium: dig up that hdd?
 waterproofsodium: install win 3.1?
 waterproofsodium: recover them?
 ZndrBrok: i just remember that i followed a protocole 
 ZndrBrok: and i was mining them on my computer
 ZndrBrok: i am not even sure that i had a wallet
 waterproofsodium: hm
 ZndrBrok: i thing it was a little bit different then
 ZndrBrok: but like i said
 ZndrBrok: it was not so relevant to me
 ZndrBrok: so can't even say for sure :P
 waterproofsodium: buy the software you used and reverse engineer the protocol to recover them?
 ZndrBrok: Maybe if i dig dep in the internet i can find the software haha
 ZndrBrok: i need to find the forum where i learn about them
 waterproofsodium: "maybe I can find 14 btcs"
 waterproofsodium: sigh
 ZndrBrok: and see if the topic is still there :p
 waterproofsodium: might be worth hurrying
 ZndrBrok: But i'm not sure it will help me haha
 waterproofsodium: imagine me kicking your butt on this
 ZndrBrok:&#160;:/
 ZndrBrok: I kick myself already
 waterproofsodium: if you ever become rich from me kiccking your butt remember me pls
 waterproofsodium: :P
 ZndrBrok: At least ont time per year
 ZndrBrok: i speak about it
 ZndrBrok: and after that
 ZndrBrok: i want to go cry :P
 ZndrBrok: Speaking about that...
 ZndrBrok: I go smoke &amp; cry&#160;!
 ZndrBrok: Good Night everybody&#160;!
 waterproofsodium: but i don't get it
 waterproofsodium: why didn't you stick to it?
 ZndrBrok: On the same forum
 waterproofsodium: did you run into any very specific problem taht was almost unsolvable?
 ZndrBrok: Some smart guy give some magic equation
 ZndrBrok: and from what i have understand
 ZndrBrok: with my configuration
 ZndrBrok: used electrivity costed more that btc was worth in that time 
 ZndrBrok: so i stopped&#160;:^p
 ZndrBrok: jajaj
 waterproofsodium: no i mean
 waterproofsodium: recovering
 ZndrBrok: i was not visionary on this one
 ZndrBrok: :P
 waterproofsodium: why did you not think through how you could recover them
 ZndrBrok: because from what i know it's impossible
 ZndrBrok: I see people cry and almost suicide after loosing even more :P
 waterproofsodium: why's it impssible?
 ZndrBrok: I would need to have the hardware and passwords
 waterproofsodium: ah so you forgot a password?
 ZndrBrok: bro, i don't even remember wxhat software i was using haha
 waterproofsodium: thought you still had the hardware
 waterproofsodium: well def worth finding out?
 ZndrBrok: It was really the begin of btc
 waterproofsodium: maybe you even used mainstream software?
 ZndrBrok: Mmm
 ZndrBrok: Actually
 ZndrBrok: Fck it
 ZndrBrok: u make me believe i can maybe recover them
 ZndrBrok: it's to much pain hahaha
 waterproofsodium: i do not see why not
 ZndrBrok: I want to just take the red pill and forget them :P
 ZndrBrok: Need to find another train to go :P
 waterproofsodium: it might be as simple as installing the right program and copying over data from one disk to another
 waterproofsodium: well
 waterproofsodium: give the disk to me. I'll red pill you :P
 ZndrBrok: But i would need ot have the computer and password&#160;?
 ZndrBrok: or at least one&#160;?
 ZndrBrok: I can't go back to my kids days
 waterproofsodium: yeah that's why I asked whether you had pw still
 ZndrBrok: to briing back my computer
 ZndrBrok: no no bro
 ZndrBrok: nothing&#160;:(
 ZndrBrok: Or maybe i have put that on a usb stick and have forgot
 ZndrBrok: Something is twikling in my memory :P
 ZndrBrok: Anyway
 ZndrBrok: It's just pain 
 ZndrBrok:&#160;:(
 ZndrBrok: I would be so rich if i was more smart on this one
 waterproofsodium: i mean you didn't really lose much besides electricity
 waterproofsodium: same
 waterproofsodium: I really missed that early 2000 boom
 ZndrBrok: Yes, it's how i try to see it
 ZndrBrok: but u know...
 struct: Just pretend to be smart
 struct: works for some
 ZndrBrok: Some don't even need to pretend and are succesfull :P
 ZndrBrok: Life is life :P u can be the more adapted, powerfull, smart genetic creature and u still can get just crushed by a meteor :P
 ZndrBrok: waterproofsodium, maybe someday a new generation of blockchains products will smile to us&#160;!
 waterproofsodium: na that is over
 ZndrBrok: But for now like u said, i missed my chance and i don't like to much the nft speculation idea
 waterproofsodium: at the point where everyone knows there's money to make there's usually no more much money to make
 ZndrBrok: Even if people can make a lot of money from that, i don't pretend that not*
 ZndrBrok: Ok, stop with hurting myself for today haha
 ZndrBrok: good night all
 ZndrBrok:&#160;!
 ZndrBrok: Before all i need to wind a junior job
 waterproofsodium: good night ZndrBrok

 Nymeria-: of course it's an int&#160;: "     int KR = in.nextInt(); // row where Rick is located.

 Nymeria-: if I declare like this&#160;: 
 struct: hmm I have no idea sorry, my java knowledge is very low
 Nymeria-: No you're right, there is an issue with the converting. I would like to submit a bugreport but cannot find the proper place to do it

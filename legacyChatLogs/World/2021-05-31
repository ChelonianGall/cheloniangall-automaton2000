 Manchi_o6o7: guys, is there any easy way to write a function that deletes a node from a binary tree, but the function should return an int
 ArtLiteracyStory: what int?
 Manchi_o6o7: I wrote the function, but it is type of NODE deleteNode( NODE* root, char *delete)
 ArtLiteracyStory: the value of the deleted node?
 Manchi_o6o7: the function should return 1 if the node is deleted
 Manchi_o6o7: NODE *deleteNode( NODE **root, char *delete)
 Manchi_o6o7: this is my protoype, sorry
 ArtLiteracyStory: Are there any assumptions you can make about the values in the tree or can they be in any order?
 Manchi_o6o7: they are sorted alphabetically
 ArtLiteracyStory: After you delete the item, you'll need to heapify the tree
 ArtLiteracyStory: I think
 ArtLiteracyStory: sounds like it's a min heap with letters
 Manchi_o6o7: is there any way that I can return an int in some cases, rather than a NODE *tree
 Manchi_o6o7: I delete the NODE properly
 Manchi_o6o7: but I want to return 1 if it is succesfully deleted
 ArtLiteracyStory: you'll need to binary search for the node and if binary search fails, return -1
 ArtLiteracyStory: or something?
 Manchi_o6o7: yes, but I can't return -1
 ArtLiteracyStory: what do you want to return if the search fails?
 Manchi_o6o7: because my fucntion is type NODE*
 ArtLiteracyStory: the return type is NODE*?
 Manchi_o6o7: yes
 ArtLiteracyStory: You could return NULL if it fails.
 ArtLiteracyStory: but you are trying to return -1?
 ArtLiteracyStory: oh wait I see
 ArtLiteracyStory: You want to return 1 if it succeeds
 Manchi_o6o7: yes, the null part is okey
 Manchi_o6o7: but how can I return 1
 Manchi_o6o7: if it goes well
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a10d1175-d01f-460e-99c7-f5edbd46f78e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a10d1175-d01f-460e-99c7-f5edbd46f78e</a>
 Manchi_o6o7: here you have the function
 ArtLiteracyStory: I mean I think you could technically return 1 if you wanted
 ArtLiteracyStory: The caller would probably not expect it. Typically when you return a pointer it's expecting an address to a NODE or null. So it might have some issues.
 Manchi_o6o7: I don't know how can I deal with it properly
 ArtLiteracyStory: Why do you want to return 1?
 Manchi_o6o7: it an university task
 Manchi_o6o7: it is*
 ArtLiteracyStory: they specifically said deleteNode's return type is NODE* and that you should return 1 if the search succeeds?
 Manchi_o6o7: it can be type int
 Manchi_o6o7: but I don't know how to delete a binary tree not reursively
 ArtLiteracyStory: oh
 ArtLiteracyStory: You can use a queue or stack I think, can't remember which one
 ArtLiteracyStory: I think a stack
 ArtLiteracyStory: Here's an iterative solution <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.techiedelight.com/delete-given-binary-tree-iterative-recursive/">https://www.techiedelight.com/delete-given-binary-tree-iterative-recursive/</a>
 ArtLiteracyStory: They use a queue
 Manchi_o6o7: yes, the delete the complete tree
 Manchi_o6o7: I need just one node
 ArtLiteracyStory: oh
 Manchi_o6o7: maybe it is the same logic
 ArtLiteracyStory: Do you have to maintain the tree such that it's like a min heap?
 ArtLiteracyStory: keep it alphabetical after removal of the node?
 ArtLiteracyStory: i'd look into iterative min heap
 KiwiTae: Manchi_o6o7  u can use refsbool deleteNode( Node** , char* , &amp;Node out) 
 KiwiTae: then just fill out if you need it 
 KiwiTae: and use boolean or int value in return statement

 Wontonimo: hey derjack and Astrobytes, how's things?
 derjack: monday things?
 Wontonimo: sounds about right
 derjack: finally sunny weather without the risk of sudden rain
 sbdm666: hello boisd
 sbdm666: bois*
 Wontonimo: it snowed here last Friday.  That was weird
 Wontonimo: killed a lot of bugs which I'm not complaining about
 Astrobytes: yeah, weather's nice here too
 derjack: snow? in canada? w00t?
 Astrobytes: lol
 Marchete: 30ºC here
 Astrobytes: 21-22ºC here. I miss London summers.When I moved back up to Scotland from there it was 36ºC when I left, and 17ºC and raining when I got here (in September)
 Marchete: 20-29 is nice
 Marchete: but Madrid at summer is not suitable for humans
 Marchete: +40ºC
 1rre: 40°C @ 10-30% humidity is unironically better than 20°C @ 80-100% humidity
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I worked a year in Corfu once, +40ºC too. Sleep for a few hours when it's hottest in the afternoon. I like it 30-38ºC
 1rre: Even 50°C in a desert with low humidity is better than 25°C in the UK
 Astrobytes: lol, not wrong
 KiwiTae: what about 40+ with 100% humidity?
 struct: 40º is not that bad
 struct: I rode my road bicycle with that temperature, my bpm were 20 higher with same power output
 Astrobytes: I sanded the interior of a 3 storey house in that heat (the big white Greek houses)
 Astrobytes: That was less than fun.
 Astrobytes: And I didn't get paid.

 Scarfield: now make a script to delete these files, nothing can go wrong
 MSmits: haha
 struct: Could be worse
 jacek: 4000? thats not much
 MSmits: cuz i stopped it in time, it was an infinite loop :P
 reCurse: Not sure what's C++ specific about messing that up eh
 MSmits: maybe it's not actually. I'm just not used to generating multiple file. It didn't even occur to me that writing a file "it1.txt" and then a file "it2.txt" etc. in a loop might carry some risk :0
 SlyCooper: Hey guys, can you tell me if there is a way to program here with more than 1 file?This is getting hard to debug xD

 PatrickMcGinnisII: shoulda said gradients
 densch: hey, quick question: in the asteroids easy pratice thing, how does one know where the "point of observation" is? like the only hints in the text are that the asteroid with letter A is the closest but nothing about the exact position or something.
 densch: or am I seriously supposed to mathematically deduce which the perfect point for the opoint of observation is such that the ordering of asteroids makes sense? :O
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's a 2d picture
 densch: I know. doesnt really tell me where the piint of observation is though?
 tinkering_around: hello world
 densch: hi
 PatrickMcGinnisII: don't need it...simple nx=ox+(change iny/(t2-t1)*(t3-t1)) ... that kinda thing
 tinkering_around: just joined this, nice community
 densch: wut? :O
 tinkering_around: :worried:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just compute new point by the step in the slope
 PatrickMcGinnisII: draw a line
 densch: oh, well, I'm dumb -.-
 densch: in the end step if in the t3 picture 2 asteroids would be at the same position so they obviously would be at the same distanc away from ANY reference point. so "the output only the closest one." must refer to the initial ordering that was based on t1. namely the letter associated with each asteroid
 densch: so if like C and G would land on the same point, the letter C would be placed on that coordinate in the t3 picture. -.-
 densch: sometimes I'm thinking too much into things
 densch: where the observation point is doesnt matter in the slightest -.-
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I guess it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: s a vector mathat thing, point direction
 densch: well, yeah, I totally expect the asteroid to keep flying along the line indicated by the change between picture a and b. so traveling in the same direction vector wise
 densch: this thing is more about math tha actual programming&#160;:-D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nx=x1+(dx/(t2-t1)(t3-t1)) ... dont forget to round down
 densch: good old (int) will do the job for me. will kepp stuff doubles until I calculate the final t3 x and y coordinates
 densch: int+int*double should automatically be calculated as double values, right? like, without any casting written there?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: depends on language, in general yes ... but warning or error may appear
 densch: java in my case
 jacek: += would automatically cast to variable type

 AntiSquid: 900k / year&#160;? cost of living must be through the roof too
 Nath1325: hi how can I challenge a friend plz
 Chainman: in MCTS what should be the value of a node?  the winrate?
 ZarthaxX: you can check that on papers
 ZarthaxX: but yeah, that can be
 ZarthaxX: the stadistics of the winrate
 Chainman: like (number wins)/total visits
 Chainman: that seems to be what the paper is doing
 Marchete: it depends
 Marchete: that's a part 
 Marchete: SumScore and visits
 Chainman: actually says total visits/number wins
 Marchete: are used on SelecT()
 Marchete: it's part of the UCT
 Marchete: but when you end your search, in theory you just pick the most visited
 AntiSquid: there are more than 1 MCTS variants Chainman
 Chainman: I think that was a mistake in the article though
 Chainman: I saw (total visits)/(number wins)
 Chainman: but another article uses w/n
 Chainman: (number wins)/(total visits) which makes sense
 Nerchio: doesn't matter which metric i use it never works
 AntiSquid: what have you tried out Nerchio&#160;?
 Marchete: it's (number wins) if your losses are 0.0
 Marchete: it should be sumScore
 Nerchio: basic MCTS with UCT formula
 Nerchio: but yeah i need to give it another go :D
 Marchete: as score is -1,0,+1
 Marchete: MCTS is tricky with UCT formula
 Marchete: you need a balance between the two parts
 Nerchio: i tried UTTT maybe that was one of the problems lol
 AntiSquid: hard to debug
 Chainman: I'm just doing TTT as a starter 
 Nerchio: yeah my bot is in bronze with MCTS
 Nerchio: :D
 Marchete: debug a lot
 Marchete: see first levels of the tree
 Marchete: visits, UCT parts per children
 Marchete: etc
 Marchete: to guess what can be wrong
 AntiSquid: i have problems evaluating opp properly
 Nerchio: i will rewrite it from scratch for the 3rd time
 Nerchio: but not my first plan :D
 Chainman: I created an MCTS for TTT I think lol.

 ZarthaxX: or play against it manually :P
 ZarthaxX: no need for making the game yourself

 struct: I currently dont do it
 struct: But I think top players do
 Chainman: oh really?
 memcorrupt: do private clash of code games raise ranking
 Chainman: cause for TTT, I just thought if I already have a state existing, why not just start from there later instead of recreating the tree.
 Chainman: Cause everything beneath that node should still be true
 struct: yes thats what i said
 struct: :p
 Chainman: when?
 Chainman: I'll need to hash my nodes to do something like that I think. 
 Chainman: so I can quickly start from a node
 struct: you dont need that
 struct: you can just check the move
 struct: and pick the node that had that move
 Chainman: I'd have to check the move that the human makes too
 struct: yeah
 Chainman: cause I was going to play against my bot at start lol
 Chainman: before having it play itself idk
 Chainman: might not do that tbh
 Chainman: nah it's harder you are right to propagate it back up the mcts. 
 Chainman: I mean if I reuse the tree
 Fafar: hi
 padobranac: great
 Fafar: why if i print in a clash of code, the thest found nothing?
 Fafar: test**
 padobranac: finally got into top 2% for bot programming but cant progress on the AI quest map...
 padobranac: @fafar maybe your code was not executed
 padobranac: but more likely the program expects you to print more than one line
 padobranac: so for the second line it says it found nothing
 Fafar: i think this is ok but idk 
 Greg_3141: my guess is that the quest map and the leaderboard define "top 2 percent" differently due to rounding
 padobranac: thanks greg but thats not it. I actually made it to 0.9% so rounding wouldnt have made a difference. 
 padobranac: there seems to be a lag between the quest and ranking
 padobranac: it came trough just now
 ElJoe2: are clash of code's exercises worth it?
 ElJoe2: i think they're filled with ai
 padobranac: nah
 padobranac:  no ai in CoC
 padobranac: mostly simple maths/physics or working out relationships between input and output
 padobranac: they are good little puzzles
 padobranac: i enjpy them but depends what you are trying to get out of them
 DEVA1: Hello!
 hexa8: Sup
 Chainman: okay my mcts for TTT seems to be working 
 Greg_3141: I wish leetcode supported more languages
 YummyPotato: meowwwwwww
 Chainman: meow
 hexa8: woof
 Chainman: hmmm my mcts for TTT is worse than me.  I can beat it so easily.  
 Chainman: I even try letting it win, and everytime it choose to block me and end in tie instead of winning lol
 Chainman: basically it avoid winning two times I gave it a chance.
 struct: so its bugged
 Chainman: I wonder if I shouldn't increase winrate for draws lol
 Chainman: It is going for draws too much
 Chainman: but Idk how it let me win once though
 Chainman: that's just bad
 Chainman: not sure what to put for exploitation constant, I tried 1.4,2,3
 struct: ok I thought I had a bug but I dont have
 struct: Chainman if its not bugged
 struct: 1.0 exploration should work
 Chainman: You have a bug?
 Wontonimo: is your constant in or out of the sqrt?
 Chainman: outside
 struct: No, I thought I had
 Wontonimo: and is your reward 0,.5,1 or -1,0,1&#160;?
 struct: Chainman how many states do you get
 struct: if you let the tree fully expand?
 Wontonimo: and are you able to print out the first level of your tree with numVisits and totalReward?  It can really help identify what's happening.
 struct: I mean nodes*
 struct: fully expanded tree should be 549945 nodes
 Wontonimo: if your constant is too high, all nodes will have the same numVisits, too low and just the first okay one it finds will have 90% + the visits
 Wontonimo: of the first move
 struct: yeah, I think he should increase exploration
 struct: just to check if the tree expanded returns the same number
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 struct: I thought the number was less
 struct: because I was checking wiki
 Chainman: Wontonimo I have -1,0,1
 struct: But the correct number is indeed 549945
 Chainman: actually I have -1,1,1
 Chainman: I just threw draw/win together
 Wontonimo: change that if you can.  MCTS will try to fit your model, and if your model isn't real then it will play the wrong game.
 Chainman: oh oops
 Chainman: I was actually adding 0 for a lose
 Chainman: It's doing 50k iterations
 Chainman: supposed
 Chainman: anyway I updated my rewards to -1,0.5,1 but I just beat it lol
 Chainman: with exploration_constant at 1
 Wontonimo: why 0.5 for a tie?
 Wontonimo: try [-1,0,1] for the rewards and an exploration constant of 4.  If that doesn't win TTT, then there is definitely a bug, maybe in your backprop.  Do you flip the reward during backprop?
 Chainman: okay I print data from the root node of the tree.
 Chainman: so there are 50k visits as expected with 50k iterations.
 Chainman: although not sure how many states are created
 Chainman: the reward to root is -38374 lol
 Chainman: I did 0.5 for tie, cause I thought it is better to tie than lose
 Chainman: cause in TTT it is abnormal to actually win, most games are tie if both play optimal
 Wontonimo: it is, that is why it is 0 and not -1 :D
 Wontonimo: If i win 1 game and you tie 3, do you win over all?  with 1,0.5,-1 for your reward you will think you will.
 Chainman: I try that, I'm beating him easily lol&#160;:(
 Chainman: maybe I need to check number of states, 
 Chainman: the reward grows very large quick for the root, it is -100k after the 2nd turn.
 Chainman: I mean grows small*
 Chainman: seems he is finding lot more losses than wins somehow
 Chainman: wth
 Wontonimo: you may be attributing the win/loss to the opposite player by accident
 Wontonimo: g'night.  I'm out
 struct: gn

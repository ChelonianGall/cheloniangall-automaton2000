 qhug8: hi
 qhug8: im in canada
 colbh: hi
 kira_kira: normrm2191 guys I need some help w/ the puzzle of the weekIm so lost
 micoze-stella: i think its puzzle is difficult, too
 WOLFRAHH: yeah same here i want some hint with puzzle of the week
 davilla: PotW literally has published papers on algorithms to solve it
 davilla: ridiculously hard problem, unless n=2
 zukarinkuari2: hi
 DanniBoy: i dont get why these people dont share their codes
 kilicmustafa: hi
 bobby2: @DanniBoy yeah me neither. Aren't we all here to learn? 
 JSboss: Fermat's Little Theorem helps with the POTW
 KiwiTae: i dont like nuggets
 Uljahn: AutomatonNN: damn euler's toadient
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code in the contest&#160;?
 Doju: Well
 Doju: I managed to make my new c++ code run
 Doju: good news: got 55k nodes vs 2k on python
 Doju: bad news: all the nodes are the same pointer&#160;:-D
 WOLFRAHH: can anybody tell where is my mistake
 WOLFRAHH: in power of thor
 WOLFRAHH: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/573fe8fe-951e-4abf-96cd-c1da4e42a619">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/573fe8fe-951e-4abf-96cd-c1da4e42a619</a>
 Doju: What's the problem?
 Doju: WOLFRAHH what's the problem?
 WOLFRAHH: falier of 3 and 4th test cases
 WOLFRAHH: Doju
 jacek: in first you have d+= in second you have d=
 Doju: oh right yeah, they should be the other way around
 Doju: check north and south first
 Doju: because now if you need to go north or south you'll overwrite the variable d
 WOLFRAHH: again failier
 WOLFRAHH: :sob:
 Doju: Are you now checking north and south first?
 Doju: so that they have =
 Doju: but east and west have +=
 WOLFRAHH: yeah i checked
 WOLFRAHH: not worked
 Doju: hm...
 WOLFRAHH: so what for me
 Doju: can i see your code again?
 WOLFRAHH: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3ba4a3b6-565b-4838-9903-2f44a3e02ec1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3ba4a3b6-565b-4838-9903-2f44a3e02ec1</a>
 Doju: ok i see
 Doju: so
 Doju: lets think about it
 Doju: so you have d=<i></i>
 WOLFRAHH: yeah
 KiwiTae: WOLFRAHH indeed if u had to go NW u fail cause your code return N
 Doju: you want it to be one of these: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
 Doju: you had the right idea with the first version of your code
 Doju: but it was just in the wrong order
 Doju: you need check N and S first
 Doju: so they come at the beginning of the string
 Doju: now you're checking them after E and W
 Doju: Then whatever d is after checking north and south you just add E or W to the end if needed
 KiwiTae: im stuck at 83char in power of thor
 WOLFRAHH: hey i do it
 KiwiTae: gg

 WOLFRAHH: Doju
 Doju: Nice!
 KiwiTae: WOLFRAHH u can try the episode 2 now
 WOLFRAHH: thanks for help
 WOLFRAHH: after some time
 WOLFRAHH: KiwiTae
 WOLFRAHH: thanks for help Doju
 jacek: :3
 Doju: Now i need some help :d
 Doju: How is it possible that ptr is always the same?
 Doju:                 Node child{current_node, value};
 Doju: that is in a loop and ptr is always the same address
 magaiti: is this c++?
 Doju: yes, magaiti
 magaiti: you are constructing a temporary object on the stack, then taking address of it
 magaiti: you should create the object on the heap, or something
 magaiti: use operator new
 jacek: i think he knows that. but he wonders why it has the same address
 Doju: i did not know that
 magaiti: like Node* ptr = new Node{current_node, value};
 magaiti: because it's the address of the object on the stack
 magaiti: which happens to be the same 
 magaiti: because it's recreated over and over 
 Doju: ohh
 Doju: this is a really unfriendly language for beginners :p
 Doju: thanks
 magaiti: it is
 Doju: now it works
 magaiti: remember to delete your tree when you dont need it 
 Doju: Right
 magaiti: using operator delete. or you could use smart pointers, which is another huge chunk of knowledge
 Doju: Erm
 magaiti: or you could manage your nodes in an array, and store array index instead of a pointer
 jacek: or dont delete at all on CG, no wasted time
 Doju: so i need to somehow loop though each node and delete it
 magaiti: yeah, kinda, you can do it recursively
 Doju: oh yeah i can take the last nodes and do it recursively there, true
 jacek: virtual ~MctsMove() { for (auto &amp; m&#160;: children) { delete m; } }
 Doju: I'm storing the parent instead of the children
 Doju: but yeah i think i got it
 jacek: oO
 magaiti: how do you walk your tree then?
 Mil27Coder: hi
 Doju: i don't really need to go from the root outwards ever
 Doju: i'm storing the last "layer" of nodes
 Doju: and when i run out of time
 magaiti: then i humbly assume it's something different from mcts
 Doju: just breadth first pretty much
 Doju: hahah
 Doju: when i run out of time i just evaluate the last nodes, grab the best one and then go towards the root to get the first child node
 magaiti: hmm, but 
 magaiti: your opponent will not make bad moves
 magaiti: hopefully for him
 magaiti: how do you account for that
 magaiti: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax</a>
 Doju: The opponent doesn't even exist in my program :D
 Doju: This is for the fall challenge
 magaiti: ahh well then
 Doju: I think considering the opponent's moves is not important enough for me 
 Doju: given that i'm a beginner in c++
 Doju: and i just want to make something that works
 magaiti: depends on your definition of "works"
 Doju: it has taken me 3 or 4 days just to translate my 500 lines of python to  c++
 magaiti: compile and doesn't crash&#160;!= works
 Doju: Makes somewhat sensible moves = works
 magaiti: "somewhat sensible"
 Doju: and can go beyond 3 moves in depth (unlike the python version) :p
 jacek: do you have pragmas?
 Doju: err
 Doju: i'm not really sure what they are but i have #pragma once in all of my headers
 Doju: which doesnt really matter since this is all one file now
 jacek: as first lines
 jacek: #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast,unroll-loops,omit-frame-pointer,inline"
 jacek: to tell compiler to compile with optimizations
 Doju: thanks
 magaiti: do you need popcnt? i think it's included in bmi2
 Doju: i'll plug that in and see
 Doju: WOAH
 jacek: i copy pasted mindlessly
 Doju: it's 5 times faster
 Doju: hahah
 jacek: as everything
 magaiti: also i doubt a beginner would use  avx and bmi2
 jacek: well the compiler could translate some loops to avx itself
 magaiti: maybe, doesn't really happens thet much
 magaiti: welp i stand corrected,
 magaiti: "avx" just increased my rollouts count in clobber from 60k to 100k
 Doju: Hmm
 Doju: why should I need to manually delete my tree?
 Doju: if it gets out of scope on every turn in the game
 magaiti: nodes created by operator new dont get out of scope, only their pointers do
 JSboss: for those who were asking for more solutions to be published for the weekly challenge, i just posted a JS one
 Doju: oh, alright
 Doju: Ouch, deleting the nodes is gonna be rather difficult without storing the children
 magaiti: i recommend using array instead
 magaiti: use push_back() to add node, and store index istead of pointer. then just clear the array
 magaiti: as a rule of thumb, you should not use poerator new in modern c++, unless you know what you are doing
 Doju: okay
 magaiti: so just grow your array of nodes, and store index of parent
 Doju: I guess i'll do that
 magaiti: then clear the array (resize to 0) when you dont need them any more
 magaiti: std::vector&lt;MYNODE&gt;
 Doju: got it
 Doju: oh dear
 Doju: my string, which is supposed to be one of these: "BREW", "CAST", "LEARN", "REST"
 Doju: is "-1100793648"
 jacek: how do you assign it
 Rens2005: fuck &lt;- is this filtered
 Rens2005: no

 Insta-x: help, want to solve mars lander using GA but couldn't meet time limit of 100ms, is it even possible?
 zukarinkuari2: hmmmm 
 zukarinkuari2: idek 
 darkhorse64: If your GA works properly, it will converge towards a good first move. Use that and keep on searching
 darkhorse64: If I recall correctly, I find an answer within the first second with ML2
 _Jeffry_: You can run the GA for as long as you can (like 98ms) each turn to get the best possible "first move" every time. Just restart your GA every turn with new starting settings from inputs  
 Insta-x: so reset GA and use the best first move every turn?
 Insta-x: in the blog that i read about solving mars lander with GA, i think that the code solve everything in the first turn and use that solution. though its funny that the blog said the time limit is several seconds
 Insta-x: thx for the help
 warsameabdalla: i am really stuck on the chuck norris problem
 warsameabdalla: can somebody check my code i keep getting a bus error
 Alshock: Insta-x the blog made everything in the first turn, but you can delay. You can also reause your poppulation from the previous turn in your search, try stuff and keep what works
 Alshock: @warsameabdalla you're probably writing something that's out of bound
 Alshock: You can dump your code in this chat and it should give you a nice pastebin for it
 Insta-x: ok, thx for the tips
 warsameabdalla: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/99395a86-6d10-4354-8939-06435f6216b3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/99395a86-6d10-4354-8939-06435f6216b3</a>
 Uljahn: the first turn time limit is 1 second btw
 Alshock: the best tip I can give you is: look at what your AI is doing. And if it fails to converge or converges too fast, try to find out why. Try to stay calm and tolerant in your fitness though, you don't want to accentuate local minima
 warsameabdalla: thanks Alshock i just posted it
 Alshock: xD just a note from first glance warsameabdalla: *(p+t) = 1 + '0' &lt;=&gt; p[t] = '1'
 Alshock: not your actual issue though
 warsameabdalla: I literally just got the function from the internet lol
 warsameabdalla: the bus error seems to be coming from this line 
 warsameabdalla: char asciiNumber = MESSAGE[j];
 Alshock: there's too much I don't understand in your code, for instance, why do you use strtok to split words? I thought CN was about characters
 Alshock: Oh mb I was reading commented bits, should get the highlighting in an editor rather than pastebins xD
 warsameabdalla: i am new to this ill try post it without the commented bits 
 warsameabdalla: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0c3f257e-1932-4cb0-b6ca-76681cc9118e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0c3f257e-1932-4cb0-b6ca-76681cc9118e</a>
 warsameabdalla: i hope this is easier to read
 RoboStac: your scanf doesn't do anything (it doesn't support regex and even if it did that still wouldn't match)
 Alshock: for some reason, it does. That's what I don't understand.
 warsameabdalla: thanks for that guys the bus error has gone,
 warsameabdalla: however the game came with that scanf("%[^\n]", MESSAGE);
 warsameabdalla: i changed it to this now scanf("%s", MESSAGE);
 RoboStac: oh wow, apparently that is actually a thing
 Alshock: AH AH AH LMFAO you manage to put stuff in MESSAGE somehow
 RoboStac: looks like your str[] array isn't big enough so you overwrite other variables
 Alshock: There's a lot of stuff that gets overwritten, j included
 Alshock: btw all your decimal_to_binary are leaking memory, but that's a secondary issue at this point)
 warsameabdalla: im really confused lool
 Alshock: When I write j and MESSAGE[j] at every step I get this:
 Alshock: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c3ac45a0-e59e-4911-8217-0ccd112c2b73">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c3ac45a0-e59e-4911-8217-0ccd112c2b73</a>
 Alshock: That's kinda wrong
 Alshock: ooooh I get it
 Alshock: the strcat
 Alshock: you're not giving a pointer as second param
 Alshock: you're actually also writing a pointer in a char to begin with
 BlaiseEbuth: Alshock&#160;! Stop annoying people on world&#160;! Go back on FR&#160;!
 warsameabdalla: i know ive been asking alot of questions but what shall i change alshock
 AntiSquid: why? it's ok, less users on FR more for World 
 Tuo: warsameabdalla you are trying to add to str (length 9) multiple return values of decimal_to_binary(length 8?)
 Tuo: also string variable is a char ** for some reason. thats why you need to dereference it, *string in code
 2kpro: hey
 2kpro: good morning everyone\
 tax0801: Hi!
 MasterCoderxD: hey guys
 MasterCoderxD: help
 Qyxi: Morning. I'm new here. I read the weekly puzzle and I'm not sure I understand the question as the author intended. I look at the possible solutions to the example, and 3 isn't the highest number of nuggets that can not be served. Buying a 5 and a 1 isn't possible, so 6. But even more so, 20 x 5 + 1, infinity * 5 +1 is the highest that can not be served. Since there is not a 1 pack. 
 MasterCoderxD: Can somebody edit and fix the errors in this Java code? 
 MasterCoderxD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/35008b02-2922-4c6e-9d8f-f75016874fb3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/35008b02-2922-4c6e-9d8f-f75016874fb3</a>
 MasterCoderxD: I am trying to create a range() function, like the one in python3
 jacek: Qyxi you can buy 5 and 2. you can buy 6 by buying 3 x 2 nuggets
 MasterCoderxD: Just experimenting as i am a noob in Java
 jacek: MasterCoderxD there is no default values in java methods
 MasterCoderxD: The problem is the part where i set default values for my functional parameters (like in C++)
 jacek: use range(int a,int b,int c)
 MasterCoderxD: But how do i set default values
 Qyxi: Indeed, overlooked that.  So, infinity * 5 + 1 if it's odd becomes the answer.
 jacek: the only way to achieve this in java is to overload method
 MasterCoderxD: i know i googles it, but i don't quite get it
 MasterCoderxD: can u plz just rewrite the code? if u have time?
 MasterCoderxD: it's open to everyone btw
 linjoehan: I'm need to learn how to write tests in java quick. any helps?
 MasterCoderxD: *googled not googles
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4080e302-cd78-41f1-b838-3223be96e783">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4080e302-cd78-41f1-b838-3223be96e783</a>
 jacek: junit tests?
 Tuo: int[] l = new int[b]; is too big. real size is b - a
 MasterCoderxD: that works?
 jacek: dunno
 MasterCoderxD: yeah thanks for that TUO
 MasterCoderxD: oh ok
 jacek: but should give you idea how this would work
 MasterCoderxD: but the problem is with that, it makes it compulsory to enter all the 3 parameters, for example; range(0,10,1) works but not range(10) (this is what i want)
 jacek: oh right for one
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/920983f3-32e6-4be6-8a37-fc6e8a893210">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/920983f3-32e6-4be6-8a37-fc6e8a893210</a>

 MasterCoderxD: wait i got it
 darkhorse64: gg jacek
 jacek: hm?
 darkhorse64: clobber
 jacek: quite lucky submit
 jacek: leaderboard small so much oscillations
 darkhorse64: You did such a big jump that you surely improve something 
 jacek: why yes, new net
 jacek: and i still think p1 has advantage
 jacek: its about 60% win in my tests
 ill-be-waiting-outside: hey
 darkhorse64: Definitely time to wok on new weapons. 
 darkhorse64: I have been reading a lot of things lately on NNUE, design and implementation
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 jacek: well someone got increased speed when he added avx to pragma
 darkhorse64: I wrote avx code for clobber with no effect (actually it was slower). I also did that for C4 and gained nothing. But I already got the pragma
 darkhorse64: Fun fact, my eval = 57%, your eval = 75% at one point in a game. You won ...
 jacek: look for games when i lose
 jacek: i get 0.8 then suddenly loss
 darkhorse64: I see you won a game where your eval was 0.04 at one point. You have got some bias
 jacek: or opponent made mistake
 jacek: i know theres something wrong when i evaluate high and lose anyway
 darkhorse64: At the same point, I see 50%. Tbh, I sometimes get the impression that my bot is clueless until the solver takes over
 jacek: thats vanilla mcts for ya
 Ordonnateur: Hi, can someone explain me more clearly the puzzle of the week&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/nuggets-numbers">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/nuggets-numbers</a>
 darkhorse64: yep. No eval in sight and no winning moves for heavy rollouts
 jacek: Ordonnateur whats the problem?
 Ordonnateur: I don't understand why the 68 portion part have no maximum ç_ç
 Ordonnateur: 6/8*
 Qyxi: I keep failing first test case. 20 * 5 + 3 = 103 nuggets. That's the max I cannot buy.
 darkhorse64: I'd look for diophantian equation of the first degree
 jacek: Ordonnateur because you cant buy any odd nuggets. you cant buy 10001, 255545, 5762347856348765348799 and more
 jacek: so its infinity
 Qyxi: I agree jacek, however, when I run it it expects 3.
 Ordonnateur: yes but you can't buy 1 or 3 in the first case what's the diff&#160;? the fact there is no stop&#160;?
 jacek: 3 is max you cant buy. from 2 and 5 you can buy 4,5,6,7,8,9... and so on
 Qyxi: Ordonnateur 6 and 8 are both even, there can never be an odd number generated from those values.
 darkhorse64: Only Chuck Norris can buy any number of nuggets
 jacek: Qyxi 17 * 5 + 4 * 2
 jacek: wait, 19 * 5
 Ordonnateur: Ok, I have to found how to manage the infinity part (to avoid endless loop) and I think I understand what I should do&#160;:)
 Ordonnateur: thank you Jacek&#160;:)

 AntiSquid: 2kpro &gt;/dev/null
 ill-be-waiting-outside: stop
 ill-be-waiting-outside: chill
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh thx AntiSquid.
 2kpro: im chil 
 2kpro: :relieved:
 liunique: hey
 2kpro: hey
 _Coding_Princess_: hi:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 2kpro: yo
 2kpro: antisquid can you give me some pointers i wish i was experianced like you
 jacek: he can give you only nullptr
 2kpro: ok thanks for teling me jacek
 2kpro: im so stupid i wished i started coding  a year or2 ago but im just a child
 ZarthaxX: you got a lifetime still
 2kpro: but you and other people are experianced  and i just started 
 2kpro: :disappointed:
 2kpro: i wish i was  older
 jacek: just wait and you will be
 jacek: [solved]
 _Coding_Princess_: yeah im new too
 _Coding_Princess_: i just finished intro
 jacek: onboarding?
 2kpro: im just stupid
 JLukeSkywalker: no, im stupid
 _Coding_Princess_: im super stupid
 _Coding_Princess_: i am so stupid i cant figure out Coders Strike Back... lol
 _Coding_Princess_: :grimacing:
 2kpro: i wished someone like antisquid could give me pointers but his probaly busy
 2kpro: :disappointed:
 _Coding_Princess_: yeah 
 JLukeSkywalker: most people that talk on here can give you pointers like that
 2kpro: but antisquid is busy and jonny 7 is busy
 JLukeSkywalker: just ask the questions you would ask them in here
 2kpro: so who can give me pointers
 Stormalix: everyone
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^
 jacek: int *x; here you go
 JLukeSkywalker: how dare you not use python
 YunoSama: Guys.. I really need help with something'
 Stormalix: how dare you not use JavaScript
 Stormalix: what do u need help with
 YunoSama: I am in the-descent and I don't see the GUI of the mountains nor anything
 YunoSama: In addition to
 2kpro: i wished i hade my dad
 YunoSama: I can't print in console
 jacek: restart browser
 YunoSama: I mean.. It only shows the goal and notes etc. 
 YunoSama: I guess there might be an option somewhere where I view the animation instead&#160;?
 2kpro: :sob:
 JLukeSkywalker: what puzzle
 JLukeSkywalker: can u link the url?
 rip0806: lol
 YunoSama: the-descent
 YunoSama: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent</a>
 jacek: you should see the viewer normally
 YunoSama: Hm..
 JLukeSkywalker: have you hit run?
 YunoSama: Play all testcases? or submit?
 JLukeSkywalker: just play the first test case
 JLukeSkywalker: does the console pop up?
 YunoSama: It turns green
 2kpro: :worried::disappointed::sob: im a piece of trash im nothing but a loser
 jacek: can you screenshot?
 YunoSama: Yes.. The console is there but it's totally empty
 YunoSama: Alright one second
 YunoSama: I don't think I can send any pictures here ..
 _Coding_Princess_: 2kpro you are not a loser, nor a piece of trash
 jacek: try imgur.com
 YunoSama: omw
 _Coding_Princess_: you are just learning 2kpro
 _Coding_Princess_: nothing to feel bad about
 Stormalix: ^
 JLukeSkywalker: thought we had a thing on here that captured images like code?
 2kpro: :disappointed: ok 
 2kpro: :worried:
 _Coding_Princess_: :grin:
 _Coding_Princess_: BE HAPPY
 2kpro: ok
 ErrorRazor: Lol I just discovered the button that shows the input and expected output of test cases. I've been printing the inputs to error output until now....
 YunoSama: Can I send it in discord instead? It requires registration and I am pretty lazy tbh xD
 jacek: so send it to discord
 jacek: but imgur doesnt require registration oO
 YunoSama: general&#160;?
 YunoSama: It asked me to register when I tried to add new post&#160;:/
 2kpro: :relieved:
 _Coding_Princess_: yes
 _Coding_Princess_: good
 YunoSama: It's in general
 _Coding_Princess_: :grin: happy is fun
 2kpro: thanks _coding_princess_
 2kpro: :relaxed:
 Messi100: Hi 
 _Coding_Princess_: :clap_tone1:
 _Coding_Princess_: Hi
 Messi100: how are you doing today
 _Coding_Princess_: Fine, you?
 Messi100: do you know how to code
 Messi100: I am a begginer
 _Coding_Princess_: SAME
 Stormalix: try Khan Acadenmy
 Stormalix: Academy
 Stormalix: its very helpful
 Stormalix: i learn JavaScript from KA
 Stormalix: learned
 Messi100: thank you man 
 Stormalix: it was very easy for me to understand 
 _Coding_Princess_: i use..... idk
 Messi100: your the best 
 _Coding_Princess_: i will brb
 2kpro: try code academy not khan academy
 Stormalix: if you have any questions u can hmu on KA I'm xXMoonLightXx
 Stormalix: nahh KA is better imo
 2kpro: are you a youtuber
 Messi100: no
 Stormalix: you can take a look at my projects here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/xXMoonLightXx/projects">https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/xXMoonLightXx/projects</a>
 rip0806: fuck u all
 rip0806: i'm the supreme god
 Stormalix: The community is also very helpful so if you have any questions ask anyone 
 Stormalix: nobody asked rip0906 stfu
 2kpro: :joy:
 Messi100: that was grat man 
 Messi100: I like at 
 2kpro: ye
 2kpro:  me to
 _Coding_Princess_: nobody supreme god rip0906
 JLukeSkywalker: the way to learn is totally pick a project you want to do, pick a language, and google the shit out of it
 _Coding_Princess_: and if there was one it would DEFINITELY not be you
 JLukeSkywalker: thats how i learn new languages
 Messi100: I will try that idea thank you 
 Stormalix: JLukeSkywalkerFor beginners i think its better to have a teacher rather than googling information that may or may not be relevant and may not be the best practive
 Stormalix: practice
 _Coding_Princess_: yea
 _Coding_Princess_: practice makes perfect
 2kpro: you got that right
 Stormalix: practice also makes permanent so dont learn the wrong way xD
 _Coding_Princess_: yes
 _Coding_Princess_: i gtg
 Messi100: do you the YouTuber Mark Rober
 Stormalix: yes
 _Coding_Princess_: YES I LOVE HIM
 _Coding_Princess_: he awesome
 orangesnowfox: I'd argue practice doesn't really make *perfect* as much as *progress*
 _Coding_Princess_: but i gtg
 _Coding_Princess_: so bye
 Stormalix: cya
 2kpro: cyu
 2kpro: cya
 Messi100: do you know dude perfect fromm youtube 
 Stormalix: yepp
 Stormalix: do u know Mr. Beast
 Messi100: Mrbeast 
 Stormalix: mrbeast
 Stormalix: am i the only one who read that as mr breast
 jacek: oO
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: helllo everyone
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: can anyone help with this&#160;: 
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: the first digit of a really big number using javascript
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: 123**15
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: should be 7
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: any takers&#160;??
 AntiSquid: nah i am good
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: naaaa
 ErrorRazor: Can't remember any javascript sorry
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 22313961097670283270314823109107
 ErrorRazor: Also it's not 7
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: PatrickMcGinnisII how did you do it
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: it should be rounded up
 ErrorRazor: You mean least significant digit right?
 jacek: in python its just 123**15
 jacek: i bet there is some mathematical trick to that
 jacek: could it be you only need to power the last digit, so its 3**15&#160;?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: that would be greate
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: is it
 ErrorRazor: Oh yea
 ErrorRazor: Actually no
 N-ONE: @Yessine_EL_HOSNI can you send the problem link&#160;?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i dont have it anymore
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: it was a clash of code
 N-ONE: oh 
 ErrorRazor: Does the calculation time out if you just do 123**15 etc?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: nop
 ErrorRazor: So what's the problem
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: for me in javascript it shows ...e+31
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/451883b077fe733859abfc66885dff5debc2">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/451883b077fe733859abfc66885dff5debc2</a>
 ErrorRazor: Convert to a string, output the last character
 N-ONE: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3f5e317-e25a-45c7-a2b6-4526624da7eb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3f5e317-e25a-45c7-a2b6-4526624da7eb</a>
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: ErrorRazor it did not work in javascript 
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: at least for me
 N-ONE: any help
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: thank you jacek
 jacek: is this puzzle?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: yap
 ErrorRazor: @Yassine_EL_HOSNI what if you check if the string contains "e", and if it does, take the last digit before e?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: true
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: but it was a "shortest" mode
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: and my solution was as followed&#160;:
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: r=readline,[n,p]=[+r(),+r()]print((n**p)%10)
 N-ONE: use mod
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i did
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI:&#160;% is mod in javascript
 ErrorRazor: Is there a language in which&#160;% is not mod
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i guess there is
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: 90% sure
 jacek: pascal?
 ErrorRazor: Assembly?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: hhhh guys 
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: stop
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: task at hand
 jacek: N-ONE well there is O(n) solution for that
 N-ONE: hmm really&#160;?
 N-ONE: any tips 
 N-ONE: yassine ,, try computing the power 
 jacek: i use for loop from n+1 to 2*n
 N-ONE: i mean manually 
 ErrorRazor: I don't understand the problem
 N-ONE: which one&#160;? mine&#160;?
 N-ONE: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/unit-fractions">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/unit-fractions</a>
 ErrorRazor: Ok so it's 1/n
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: NO-ONE i did
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: anyways i give up
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: next clash
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: have fun everyone
 N-ONE: i still don't know how did u do it in o(n)
 jacek: for i in [...]: if n*i&#160;% (i-n) == 0: magic happens
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://kekpe.pe/i/60637b12cc32a.png">https://kekpe.pe/i/60637b12cc32a.png</a>
 jacek: Oo
 N-ONE: yoo @Yassine_EL_HOSNI
 N-ONE: check this out 
 orangesnowfox: jacek, why does everyone use *that* solution?
 jacek: is there other no brute-force one?
 N-ONE: yes 
 orangesnowfox: Yeah... `i` is a factor `n^2`
 orangesnowfox: *of
 jacek: too mathy, do not want
 N-ONE: but i don't understand the math lol
 orangesnowfox: jacek "i&#160;% (n**2 == 0"
 orangesnowfox: err, with the closing paren
 orangesnowfox: and you go from 1 to n
 jacek: syntax error :c
 orangesnowfox: well just fix it :p
 ErrorRazor: me no understand
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: hhhhhhhhh
 N-ONE: i wonder how to copy code when using vim here&#160;?
 Messi100: hi
 Messi100: can someone tell me how they learn Jave coding please
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: look for a tutorial online, google is your best friend
 Messi100: ok
 N-ONE: there is a book called&#160;: Object-Oriented Programming and Java
 N-ONE: check it out 
 Messi100: ok
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: or dont
 Messi100: why
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: books get old
 ErrorRazor: You don't need to buy books, you'll learn best by doing tutorials and projects on your pc
 Messi100: oh ok
 N-ONE: it's free i guess ,,, i know it from college lol
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: new thing come up..
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: *things
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: look for "learn java 2020" or "learn java 2021" .. you might get lucky
 Messi100: ok
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: dont forget to have fun
 Messi100: ok
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: and if you have chosen Java as your first language every, you might what to rethink that 
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: *ever
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: *want
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: god damn
 Messi100: ok
 jacek: kree java!
 jacek: AutomatonNN what do you think of java
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to read the example of a starting point in the middle of a different pl
 Messi100: is khan Academy good
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: no clue
 jacek: someone was recommending khan today :thinking:
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: who was it i am guessing
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: was it you?? 
 jacek: no, i dont use any courses
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: naaaa 
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: you sure
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI:&#160;???
 Messi100: do you know how to use this website In a iPad because my ground want to chat what us so we can answer question for hem
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i dont understand the question
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: logically i would say "use a mobile browser"
 Messi100: so he can't chat like we do
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: ow i see 
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: you mean use the codingame chat&#160;??
 Messi100: so do you know how 
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: in mobile
 Messi100: ipad
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: can you download discord on ipad?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: if so.. and just join the codingame discord
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: this is link
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i think
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: can someone elaborate? 
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: ~and~
 Messi100: do you need a account
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: discord probably not.. but the CodinGame server.. i am guessing it is a must
 Stormalix: In my opinion Khan Academy is really good, you can learn HTML and JavaScript from there and the tutorials are very clear (the object oriented tutorial was a bit confusing for me but i understood it on the second run) 
 Stormalix: There's also a large community willing to help. Its also free sooo why not? lol
 0MNIP0TENT: i liked java as my first language. i learned it on a free app called solo learn. i went from that to cloning the classic 2d games within 2months
 therealbeef: is it a known bug of CSB that in the first turn you always get -1 as the angle of all pods?
 ErrorRazor: Yeah
 ErrorRazor: It's actually not a bug, you can go any direction on the first turn, after that you'll be limited to an angle that is within 18 degrees of your previous angle
 AntiSquid: there was something you could hardcode in that regard, for player 1 and player 2
 AntiSquid: for first turn
 therealbeef: i think it's a bug because it's a protocol violation
 therealbeef: (and search race doesnt have this)
 AntiSquid: alright good night
 ErrorRazor: gn
 therealbeef: who will ban the kiddies now?
 davilla: haha I was a bronze level coding speed yesterday
 davilla: today I'm "legend"
 Messi100: Hi do someone know a way to learn Jave programming  
 davilla: you've come to the right place

 Chillink: damn this website is still alive
 Chillink: I just found this from an old reddit post
 Salted: It's not only alive, it's awesome
 Salted: I also found this through reddit
 Saad-py: Hi all
 Saad-py: Sup
 DaBestest: Hey!
 Saad-py: I am new here
 Saad-py: They should add like a level thing in clash of code
 Saad-py: somthing that lets you pick the dificulty
 DaBestest: lol, they should
 Saad-py: haha I am a begineer
 DaBestest: coc is super fun though
 Saad-py: ikr
 DaBestest: what are ur main coding languages?
 Saad-py: python and python and pythn
 DaBestest: I wasn't even going to try that one lol
 DaBestest: same lmoa
 DaBestest: *lmao
 DaBestest: I'm trying to learn c# (it's kinda like python I guess), but I haven't gotten very far
 Saad-py: i recommend that you learn C
 Saad-py: or JS
 DaBestest: I also do css and html (not considered languages, but whatever) and a tad of js, but that be it
 Saad-py: yeah
 Saad-py: whats your age or approx age
 DaBestest: like i can figure out js with stack overflow and w3schools
 DaBestest: between 13-17
 DaBestest: you
 Saad-py: I am very small for programming
 Saad-py: I am -14
 DaBestest: oh nice! I started when i was abt 8 with like Scratch and stuff. hopefully you stick with it lol
 Saad-py: yep
 Skwerl23: you guys are entertaining
 DaBestest: oh thx lmao
 Skwerl23: lol
 Skwerl23: I know python, java, sql, powershell - i've been doing this for a little over 3 years, but have been in IT for 11
 Skwerl23: I wish i could get my 10 year old into it... I have to find a way, the future IS programming
 Saad-py: Try arduino, which will incourage them more
 DaBestest: Ik. My parents keep saying that all the programming jobs are moving to India (some of them are sure), but not ALL of them. Tech is always going to be around and it is  always going to keep advancing
 Skwerl23: National security will always keep it in country. Besides that, the future is literally automation. You're either an engineer and design the robots, or a programmer and control the robots. 
 DaBestest: Get ur kid a raspberry pi (or arduino) they are super cheap and fun to mess around with. i got one for Christmas when I was abt that age (being the nerdy kid I was, I asked for one lol) 
 DaBestest: Yeah, honestly
 DaBestest: And there is always going to be a custome
 DaBestest: customer
 Skwerl23: I got him a lego boost, and he made the cat. And played with the cat, and it just sits there
 DaBestest: lol
 Skwerl23: a raspberry pi is far beyond him. He'd maybe enjoy that other battle site for coding. Um, code combat
 DaBestest: I guess don't make it something forced tho bc then they'll really hate it
 Skwerl23: IKR
 Skwerl23: i really should just go fix a bunch of shit and have him do the labor
 DaBestest: there's mincraft on it and you can mess around with python on it
 Skwerl23: I grew up around car mechanics and electricians, and picked up a TON of skills as a kid
 DaBestest: yeah, i feel like some of that has been lost through the generation
 Skwerl23: Sadly, he's more interested in talking to people than i was
 DaBestest: especially gen z
 DaBestest: lol
 Skwerl23: It depends, but it can be weird. Today he was asking me what linux was cause i saw the short circuit on the librem 5
 TerribleBill: how in the world do your reference the variables? I tried VSpeed v_speed, S and s crazy?
 Skwerl23: in js?
 DaBestest: My brother is that age and all he does is go on scratch and play games.
 TerribleBill: py 3
 DaBestest: v = 4

 Skwerl23: oh
 Skwerl23: so variables in python
 Saad-py: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cf65288a-0d37-4220-9eb8-f0db05ac5dc6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cf65288a-0d37-4220-9eb8-f0db05ac5dc6</a>
 DaBestest: or something like that, super easy
 Skwerl23: they are just english words
 Skwerl23: so like
 Saad-py: bruh
 TerribleBill: yeah simple lander thing
 Skwerl23: v=5
 Skwerl23: print(v)
 TerribleBill: if v_speed &lt; -41
 Saad-py: Help the robot boy reach his destination. Given the number of tiles N, calculate the minimum number of jumps required for the robot to reach his destination. Here are the constraints: 1) The robot can jump up to 4 tiles at any point (say current tile is 2, then the robot can reach 3, 4, 5, 6 tiles in the next jump). 2) The destination is at Nth tile. 3) Assume Robot is on 1st tile.
 Skwerl23: if v==5: print(v)
 Saad-py: PLs hepl me
 Saad-py: pls help me
 Skwerl23: I will
 DaBestest: I don't do that stuff on here bc it makes me mad, I just do coc lol
 Skwerl23: but your links don't work
 Skwerl23: CoC is fun, but i enjoy the puzzles
 Skwerl23: it's very rewarding to finish one
 Skwerl23: i need the puzzle link
 DaBestest: they didn't work for me either, but im on my school computer so i didn't know if thatwas just me
 Skwerl23: not you it's personal to his account or something
 DaBestest: yeah, but insanely hard to get started/finish
 DaBestest: in my opinion
 Saad-py: Help the robot boy reach his destination. Given the number of tiles N, calculate the minimum number of jumps required for the robot to reach his destination.

 Saad-py: Excuse me
 DaBestest: Not to brag or anything, but I just won a coc against people that normally beat me by like 10 minutes <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/155747530deb7e8c35fc40b1bebb2bd09685ea6">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/155747530deb7e8c35fc40b1bebb2bd09685ea6</a>
 Skwerl23: bitwolf and the second one are for sure bots
 Skwerl23: they aren't the same skill each round
 DaBestest: yeah, ik lol
 Skwerl23: lol
 Skwerl23: your answer, may be used next time around as a bot
 DaBestest: yeah
 Skwerl23: @saad i need the direct puzzle link
 Skwerl23: i have no idea how to "help" with out seeing it 
 DaBestest: I have a suspicion, and I want to see if it is true: in hs, which did you all like better, algebra or geometry?
 Skwerl23: Well considering, I wrote calculator games (1998-2000) and aced my tests with out paying attention
 Skwerl23: senior year, i only went on test days, cause it was after lunch, and still got a 92
 DaBestest: that's irresponsible lmao 
 Saad-py: hey any good yt channel for learning algorithms, these competetive programming questions and intermediate python function
 Skwerl23: it was highschool
 Skwerl23: i calculated the minimum grade i needed to pass my other classes
 DaBestest: did that not lower ur gpa by a ton tho?
 Skwerl23: i'd say algebra was easier, and geometry was more fun to play around with.
 Skwerl23: no
 Skwerl23: 1 i was my teachers favorite cause i aced most the math tests, 
 Skwerl23: but 2, most math classes the tests were around 90% of the class grade
 Skwerl23: That was my highschool at least
 Skwerl23: that was 20 years ago, so forgive me if i don't remember it all that well
 DaBestest: ok, yeah I really liked algebra but dislike geometry (probably bc it is more abt rules and algebra  is more problem solving)
 Skwerl23: iirc tests were 90% and homework was 10% of the grades
 DaBestest: i was just wondering if the problem solving aspect had aything to do with the coding part yaknow
 Skwerl23: i liked graphing random shit but i wasn't super good at geometry
 DaBestest: oh, i hate graphing
 Skwerl23: i'm a security researcher, so problem solving is my thing
 DaBestest: yeah lol
 DaBestest: so then did you enjoy the problem solving side of like proofs?
 Skwerl23: i took an IQ test in HS - like 8 hours of time - and scored around 130. But my problem solving was like top of the charts, and my vocabulary was lowest "average" score
 DaBestest: that's awful to have tests as 90% of ur final grade
 Skwerl23: I would say, it came easy to me, so i didn't dislike it. Math is fun, I do it in my head a lot, even to this day. but it's not "fun" it's like breathing to me
 Saad-py: binary string to hexadecimal string in pyton
 Skwerl23: i'd say i enjoyed word problems though
 Saad-py: any idea on binary string to hexadecimal string in pyton
 Skwerl23: saad-py i know your young, but you can use better grammar than that
 Skwerl23: but yes
 eulerscheZahl: you're* :P
 Saad-py: IKR
 Skwerl23: for i in string: print(ord(i))
 Saad-py: my typing sucks
 Skwerl23: touche
 Skwerl23: ord("s") will turn s into hex
 DaBestest: i like word problems too and I really enjoy the problem solving side of math
 Skwerl23: I enjoy the problem solving of scripting a ton
 DaBestest: yeah, same
 Skwerl23: like trying to figure out how to ask 300k computers how to give me x data as fast as possible
 DaBestest: yeah
 Skwerl23: i'd rather spend 24 hours writing a script that completes in 5 mins with all the answers, than 1 hour and have a 24 hour script
 DaBestest: I don't really have any clue abt what i want to do in the cs field, idrk
 Skwerl23: a couple months ago, I had to scrape data from AD and it took over an hour to do the job, but after lots of tweaking and learning i got it down to 10ish minutes, and it had to be reused, so simplicity helped
 Skwerl23: compsci cs?
 DaBestest: Like i would either go full web-dev, front end stuff, or full cs idk
 DaBestest: oh wow that's cool
 Skwerl23: @saad - ord turns strings into hex, and chr turns them back to str's
 Saad-py: Bye guys
 Saad-py: I gtg
 DaBestest: bye
 Skwerl23: bye
 Saad-py: I got to prepare for my exam tomorrow
 Skwerl23: whats full cs
 Skwerl23: i'm in cyber security
 Skwerl23: so i program for scripting mostly
 DaBestest: i just mean like scripting
 Skwerl23: but let me tell you
 Saad-py: I have exams but still I am playing coc
 Skwerl23: if you like problem solving, go full pentester
 DaBestest: what's that?
 Skwerl23: ok
 Skwerl23: lets say google
 eulerscheZahl: penetration testing
 Skwerl23: creates a new tool
 eulerscheZahl: find security holes
 DaBestest: wait, tomorrow's sat (at least for me) lol
 Skwerl23: well you go in and find flaws by poking at it. and they pay you for breaking their stuff
 Saad-py: lmao 
 Skwerl23: it's the ultimate problem solving
 DaBestest: ah, so like white hat hacking almost-ish
 Skwerl23: not almost
 Skwerl23: 100%
 Skwerl23: white hat hackers are pen testers
 DaBestest: oh that's cool
 Skwerl23: but if you REALLY like algorithm's then CS might be right for you
 Skwerl23: pen testing is more about simple scripts that break things
 DaBestest: yeah, i know im doing cs, i just don't know what lol
 Skwerl23: like it's not complicated to form a packet 
 DaBestest: oh that's cool
 Skwerl23: it's complicated to create youtube
 DaBestest: lol
 Skwerl23: whats your favorite prog language
 DaBestest: python
 Skwerl23: why?
 DaBestest: that's practically all I know
 DaBestest: i know a tad of C#
 DaBestest: some js
 Skwerl23: python is backend
 Skwerl23: js is front end
 DaBestest: and then like html css (web dev stuff)
 Skwerl23: c# is a mixture but more backend
 Skwerl23: yea who doesnt ... LMAO jk
 eulerscheZahl: now we have node.js for server-side JS :scream:
 DaBestest: oh yeah for sure
 Skwerl23: js needs to die in a fire
 DaBestest: that' why ik js
 Skwerl23: only thing worse than js is java 
 DaBestest: lol, i tried but gave up on java
 Skwerl23: java is c++ mini
 DaBestest: what's wrongwith js, is it just outdated?
 Skwerl23: and java is just awful.
 Skwerl23: no
 Skwerl23: js is broken af
 Skwerl23: one second
 DaBestest: oh lmao

 Skwerl23: there's funny ones but i can't find it. Javascript is beyond weird and super broken
 DaBestest: oh, yep that's annoying lol
 Skwerl23: pentesters - the best- are good at python, but mostly powershell and cmdline and linux cmdline
 DaBestest: how does cmdline help?
 Skwerl23: what if i hack into your server
 Skwerl23: how do i do things?
 DaBestest: ah
 Skwerl23: i understand a TON of languages, but i can't code in most
 Saad-py: that wunnrfull
 DaBestest: that sucks
 DaBestest: @saad-py didn't you have an exam lol
 Skwerl23: OSCP was tough as hell, i had to read PHP, SQL, NOSQL, C++, Python, Java, Perl, and so on
 Skwerl23: but when i sent my exploits, either they were 90% pre-built and i tweaked, or i created them in python. Then used cmdline windows/linux to maneuver and exploit further
 Skwerl23: you need to udnerstand a ton of tools, like netcat, nmap, and so on
 DaBestest: yeah, i can understand js, java, php, c#,c, c++ (the easy guys), but I haven't really put in the effort to be able to code it w/correctsyntax
 Skwerl23: exactly
 Skwerl23: there's a fine line between CS and pentesting
 DaBestest: which is
 Skwerl23: but pentesters are wizards at commandline
 Skwerl23: and know the tools they can utilize.
 Skwerl23: but we all google for help
 DaBestest: I just heard this today and im kinda totally intrigued 
 DaBestest: oh google is the best hands down lol
 Skwerl23: the best thing about a pen test team, is that there are dozens of skillsets
 Skwerl23: you can be a god at door hacking. 
 Skwerl23: no joke, and you're invaluable
 DaBestest: which is?
 DaBestest: oh, duh
 Skwerl23: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YYvBLAF4T8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YYvBLAF4T8</a>
 Saad-py: are there any specific tools for hacking
 Saad-py: white hacking especially
 Skwerl23: yes
 Skwerl23: hundreds of them
 Saad-py: can you name some of the most important
 Skwerl23: Kali and Parrot are the linux distro's most white hat hackers start with
 Skwerl23: they are packed full of hacking tools
 Saad-py: what is Kali
 Skwerl23: a linux distro
 Saad-py: like a special linux based cm
 Saad-py: d
 Skwerl23: no
 Skwerl23: have you heard of ubuntu
 Skwerl23: or mint
 Skwerl23: or redhat
 DaBestest: yes mint, not ubuntu
 Skwerl23: you haven't heard of ubuntu
 Skwerl23: interesting
 Saad-py: yes I have heard of ubuntu
 eulerscheZahl: i always thought ubuntu is better known
 Skwerl23: exactly
 eulerscheZahl: than mint
 Skwerl23: kali is like ubuntu or mint
 Saad-py: it's a system like windows linux and mac
 Skwerl23: but it's built with hacking tools
 Saad-py: ok
 Saad-py: what do white hat hackers do
 DaBestest: I've heard of mint from some of my coding friends.. i haven't done/researched anyting linux basedwhatsoever
 Skwerl23: wanna crack wireless? use aircrack 
 Skwerl23: wanna crack passwords? use hashcat
 eulerscheZahl: or good old john
 Skwerl23: wanna scan ports? use nmap
 Skwerl23: I actually prefer john tbh
 Skwerl23: to pentest, you HAVE to know linux
 Saad-py: I want to do whitehat hacking or try to crack passwords. GUIDE ME M'Lord
 Skwerl23: lol
 Saad-py: I am serioud
 Skwerl23: there's way too much to just blurt out, but let me find a video course
 Saad-py: s
 Saad-py: Thanks M\Lord
 Skwerl23: this is probably the best place to start
 Skwerl23: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hacker101.com/">https://www.hacker101.com/</a>
 Skwerl23: but i need you to listen, and listen VERY closely
 Skwerl23: i am not joking my next few sentences can make or break your entire life
 Skwerl23: learn the laws. it boils down to that. but learn the laws
 Skwerl23: don't go poking into just any computer
 DaBestest: yeah
 Skwerl23: hacker101 is owned by hacker1 and they are a great place to start making money via white hat hacking. And you can do it totally legally and totally free
 Skwerl23: but every company you attack, requires you to follow rules
 eulerscheZahl: good point. my IT security prof reserved an entire lesson to discuss the relevant paragraphs in the law book
 Skwerl23: if you don't understand them, don't break them
 Skwerl23: i have 100's of hours in law training/guidance for this reason
 Skwerl23: but that doesn't mean you need that much.
 Skwerl23: just be extra cautious. And if you are NOT sure, spend time finding out what your limitations are
 DaBestest: yeah, see that's what concerns me..
 Skwerl23: if you accidentally break a law, don't panic. But if it's found that you did it intentionally, you're in a deep deep hole against million/billion dollar companies
 Skwerl23: I do not want to scare you
 Skwerl23: trust me
 DaBestest: yeah, noo ur good lol
 Skwerl23: most companies are more relaxed than you can ever imagine
 DaBestest: what do you do?
 Skwerl23: but if they say "don't do anything that hinders our customer access"
 Skwerl23: then don't do anything that might do that
 Skwerl23: I am actually military
 Saad-py: People Who don't like jail:  BRUH I don't care about hacking, I am good with my css
 Skwerl23: I do threat hunting
 Skwerl23: but in order to do threat hunting, you have to train on pen testing
 Saad-py: define
 Saad-py: i
 Saad-py: t
 Skwerl23: how do you find hackers, with out understanding how hackers work
 Saad-py: ok 
 Saad-py: I get it
 DaBestest: lol
 Saad-py: I want to start learning white hat 
 Skwerl23: i have probably over 2000 hours in hacking training and expertise alone
 Saad-py: so first I should learn kali linux
 Skwerl23: first i would learn linux
 Skwerl23: linux basics
 Saad-py: ok
 DaBestest: ok
 Saad-py: But I have a windows lapop
 Saad-py: laptop
 Skwerl23: then learn some windows command line basics
 Skwerl23: that's ok
 Skwerl23: windows has linux built in
 eulerscheZahl: you can use a virtual machine
 Skwerl23: one sec for link
 Saad-py: ok
 eulerscheZahl: WSL2?
 Skwerl23: yes
 kalier: use the vmware
 Skwerl23: for linux basics especially
 Skwerl23: I would use vmware for kali though
 Saad-py: When I learn this whitehat, if I have a spare laptop or computer can I test my hacking on it
 eulerscheZahl: or virtualbox, that one is free&#160;;)
 Saad-py: IS this legal
 Skwerl23: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10</a>
 Saad-py:&#160;??
 Skwerl23: if you own the device
 Skwerl23: it's yours to hack however you see fit
 Skwerl23: if you hack your neighbors, it's not
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hackerone.com/bug-bounty-programs">https://hackerone.com/bug-bounty-programs</a>check if there are bug bounties. then you can legally tinker (as long as you don't take their website offline or such)
 Skwerl23: this is how white hat hackers get great, they break their own stuff
 DaBestest: y'all have offically made me make a google doc of all this info. You honestly just made my day lol
 Saad-py: YEAH I KNOW
 Saad-py: lmao
 Skwerl23: hackerone and other bug bounties are legal ways to hack companies with lists of rules. to follow as to waht you can and can't do
 kalier: As long as you don't attack others maliciously, it's legal
 Skwerl23: like many companies have forums, and they will say "you must make a TEST forum post in order to test your attacks"
 Skwerl23: you can't go attacking other users intentionally. etc..
 Saad-py: do people build companies that are not real and let people practise their hacking??
 Skwerl23: hackthissite.org is one
 Skwerl23: it's a free for all
 Saad-py: ok
 Skwerl23: but it's web based hacking
 Skwerl23: so hacking is a multifaceted world
 Skwerl23: you can hack websites
 Skwerl23: you can hack services
 Skwerl23: like if you have heard of eternal blue
 Saad-py: One more question can I do this white hat hacking  on a WINDOWS 7
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.wechall.net/active_sites">http://www.wechall.net/active_sites</a>some are more about coding, others about crypo, ...
 eulerscheZahl: lots of resources and training exercises
 Skwerl23: against or with
 kalier: just like the penetration tester
 Saad-py: with
 Saad-py: an againt
 Saad-py: against
 hiljusti: you can hack a chicken if you're fast enough
 Skwerl23: there are tools in windows 7 i'm sure. but most of the good tools are in kali
 Skwerl23: windows 7 is so broken, it's a better target than base station
 kalier: you can，but kali has more tools
 Saad-py: Thank you very much 
 eulerscheZahl: another link with such events: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ctftime.org/event/list/upcoming">https://ctftime.org/event/list/upcoming</a>
 hiljusti: start learning wherever you are though
 Skwerl23: My best tip, is don't rush
 Saad-py: @Skwerl23
 Skwerl23: once you start learning kali
 Saad-py: yeah then
 Saad-py: Are you online like every day or something
 Skwerl23: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/">https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/</a> is a great site to practice linux on
 Skwerl23: and is more hackery than just personal terminals on your windows machine
 Skwerl23: no, not really
 Skwerl23: you can reach me at m.me/skwerl23
 Saad-py: ok thanks
 Saad-py: Thanks for guiding me
 Saad-py: I will be sure to learn these things
 Skwerl23: one pro tip
 kalier: You can look for examples on the Internet and follow them
 DaBestest: so like (one last question) how do you like "break into' a site, find weak spots
 Skwerl23: learn every foundation you can. THEN find out what you enjoy, and master that
 DaBestest: i know that is a VERY vague question
 Skwerl23: hacking has literally hundreds of areas to master. 
 Skwerl23: there are many ways dabestest
 Skwerl23: there are 3-4 main ways though
 DaBestest: i'm getting super jedi master vibes lol
 Skwerl23: 1. social engineering. Trick an employee to give you credentials
 kalier: It's not just the Internet
 Saad-py: Most people I know code to get better jobs but only some try to make the world a better place.
 Skwerl23: 2. find a known exploit and utilize it
 Skwerl23: 3. brute force it
 Skwerl23: 4. get the source code, and find your own way in
 kalier: Reverse engineering also needs learning
 DaBestest: ok, lets say i go to hackthissite.org, then what
 DaBestest: like how do i start?
 Skwerl23: Honestly
 Skwerl23: that's an easy one
 Saad-py: Now we talking bois
 Skwerl23: that site is super SUPER common
 Skwerl23: so follow a walkthrough
 Skwerl23: and question everything you're doing
 Saad-py: So users on this site can also get hacked
 Skwerl23: @saad, wait a second
 Saad-py: lol crazy logic
 Skwerl23: then once you've followed the walkthrough, try again without the walkthrough
 Saad-py: Yeah 
 kalier: learn to use the tools and You know how they works
 Skwerl23: until you can do it completely without the walkthrough
 Skwerl23: then once you have finished hackthissite
 Skwerl23: find anotherone
 Skwerl23: like
 Skwerl23: hackthis.co.uk
 Skwerl23: and do it without walkthroughs
 Skwerl23: in 6 months, you'll reallly be grasping a ton of it
 kalier: you can also buy a book
 DaBestest: omg, i am honestly so excited for tomorrow... yeah.. 
 Skwerl23: hacking into a company is usually a 4-5 part process
 Skwerl23: find the front hole
 Skwerl23: use it to get into a front server, or a second hole
 Skwerl23: get into a server, and move deeper in the network
 Skwerl23: once inside hte network
 Saad-py: what is pen tester
 Skwerl23: get admin rights
 Skwerl23: and so on
 kalier: but you shuold download vmware first
 Skwerl23: penetration tester- it's the legal job name bascially for white hat hacker
 Saad-py: so they just test something
 Skwerl23: no
 Skwerl23: they test for penetration 
 Skwerl23: can i penetrate your defenses
 Skwerl23: can i hack you
 Skwerl23: pentester is the short term for white hat hacker
 kalier: install kali on the vmware or the usb
 Saad-py: ok
 Skwerl23: if you have money. my recommendation is buy 4 or 5 used i3 laptops
 Skwerl23: set them up with different os's
 Skwerl23: and put kali on one
 Skwerl23: then try hacking them. setup services and hack them
 Skwerl23: get vm's from vulnhub and run them on different machines
 DaBestest: @kalier I tried looking for books at the library about hacking, but none were very helpful and it would look super weird if i was just chekcing out 15 books on hacking lol
 Skwerl23: hackers know a few main things. Linux command line, windows command line, tools used, and networking
 Skwerl23: @dabestest
 Skwerl23: that's the problem
 Skwerl23: we WANT you to hack
 Skwerl23: go get 500 books on it
 Skwerl23: Just hack for good, not evil
 kalier: Kali2020 does not have root permission,you should get it on kali BIOS
 Skwerl23: do not EVER worry abotu some ones opinion. 
 Skwerl23: Think about cops
 Skwerl23: and bank robbers
 Skwerl23: banks hire people to steal their money
 Skwerl23: so that they can improve their security
 Skwerl23: it's the same thing
 DaBestest: i was kidding, i check out the 20 csbooks from the library abt every time lol.. I got a whole shelf of coding libary books rn lmoa
 Skwerl23: i'll find you a video on a red team stealing legally, and why
 Skwerl23: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL9q2lOZ1Fw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL9q2lOZ1Fw</a>
 Skwerl23: you HAVE to watch that
 Skwerl23: you'll understand better,
 DaBestest: k, it's on my google doc lol
 Skwerl23: then watch everything defcon and blackhat you can
 Skwerl23: have you ever watched the lockpicking lawyer?
 DaBestest: @skwerl23 I'm pretty sure you've done ur promotions for the day lol. Thank you so much, you've really sparked an intrest. (im not leaving, just saying thankyou_
 DaBestest: nope
 Skwerl23: he hacks locks on youtube
 Skwerl23: and that's the same job
 Skwerl23: hacking locks
 Skwerl23: hacking doors
 Skwerl23: hacking people
 Skwerl23: hacking computers
 Skwerl23: hacking cameras
 Skwerl23: hacking dogs
 DaBestest: oh that's cool
 Skwerl23: you think about it, you can hack it
 Skwerl23: it's why i say, learn a ton of fundamentals
 Skwerl23: find something you LOVE and learn to hack That
 DaBestest: ok, yeah that makes sense
 Skwerl23: don't hack 300 things, hack 10-15 and be REALLY good at it
 DaBestest: people lol
 Skwerl23: derren brown
 Skwerl23: look him up on youtube
 Skwerl23: he hacks people
 Skwerl23: has a few netflix specials
 DaBestest: ok, that is weird... lol social hacking, scamming?
 Skwerl23: yea basically
 kalier: It's important to know the principle, otherwise you will only use tools.You can learn c++ hacker technology.
 Skwerl23: if i call your mom, and say you're in jail, and i'm from the jail house, and i need x info
 Skwerl23: she might fall for it
 Skwerl23: but even worse
 Skwerl23: if i tell your front door man that i'm IT and need to fix the servers
 Skwerl23: they're gonna glass eye and say ok come in
 DaBestest: yeah, that's in the paper all the time lol..
 Skwerl23: wear a verizon shirt, and people let you in
 Skwerl23: a team of hackers has specialists in each area
 Skwerl23: but everyone can do any of the jobs, jsut not very good
 DaBestest: Tho the fake phone ones are always the best. i get ones abt my car insurance being due,but i don't  own a car.. those just make me laugh, but ik they can work
 Skwerl23: so maybe the front man hacks people, but you know what he's doing, and you hack computers. and your buddy hacks doors 
 Skwerl23: you make it to the server room and steal billions
 DaBestest: yeah
 Skwerl23: wanna hear a crazy true story
 DaBestest: yep
 Skwerl23: so this team went in after a investing firm
 Skwerl23: and he saw they had "insurance" you could buy, and that it was 5 bucks. and if you wanted you could refund it
 Skwerl23: so he said "what if i refund it with out owning it"
 Skwerl23: and sent some packets via python
 Skwerl23: it gave his account 5 bucks
 Skwerl23: so he set a script to do it as fast as possible
 Skwerl23: he went to lunch
 Skwerl23: came back and checked on it
 Skwerl23: his account had 25 million dollars
 Saad-py: OMG
 Skwerl23: he asked them if they noticed anything weird
 DaBestest: tyat is crazy
 Skwerl23: they didn't
 DaBestest: oh odd...
 Skwerl23: after a week of searching (he explained what he did)
 Skwerl23: they found the account it came from
 Skwerl23: the interest it made, in that week was more than the cost of the team
 Saad-py: oof
 DaBestest: wow
 Saad-py: did he get arrested
 Skwerl23: he really debated not telling them and moving to mexico
 Skwerl23: no
 Skwerl23: it was his job
 Saad-py: ok
 Skwerl23: he was PAID to find that stuff
 Saad-py: So he has the money
 Skwerl23: no, he had to give the 25m back
 Saad-py: oh ok
 DaBestest: that stinks lmao
 Skwerl23: lol
 Saad-py: lol
 Skwerl23: but he wasn't in trouble at all, because he was in the "AOR" area of responsibility, of what he was asked to do
 Skwerl23: it took them a WEEK to find the flaw, when he explained it
 Skwerl23: imagine if REAL hackers got it
 Skwerl23: they could have stole billions
 DaBestest: oh.. that's awesome that that is something you can get paid for
 Skwerl23: 1 hour gave him 25m
 Saad-py: again what should I start with windows command line then linux and then kali linux
 Skwerl23: start wtih hacker101
 Skwerl23: follow their basic tutorials
 Skwerl23: it's free
 Saad-py: ok
 Skwerl23: when you have questions branch out
 Saad-py: wanna do a private clash
 DaBestest: sure, how
 Saad-py:  will tell
 Skwerl23: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1557530c2a4ed1ce2773ed080f1b5968afd408d">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1557530c2a4ed1ce2773ed080f1b5968afd408d</a>
 Saad-py: yes thx
 Saad-py: start
 Saad-py: wtf
 Saad-py: I dont understand what to do
 Skwerl23:&#160;:)
 Skwerl23: let me know when you have 10 minutes left
 Saad-py: what to do here, HINT
 Saad-py:&#160;??
 Skwerl23: add the left digits
 Saad-py: what there is a digit only
 Skwerl23: add the left individual digits
 DaBestest: yeah... i'm working on that lol
 Saad-py: 1 + 2 == 9
 Skwerl23: 1+2==3
 DaBestest: 1+2=3
 Skwerl23: 1+1 = 2
 Skwerl23: 2+0+2+0
 DaBestest: 3*number of digits 
 Saad-py: I know
 DaBestest: wait, nvm i said that wrong
 Saad-py: BRUH the number is 12 so result would be 3
 Skwerl23: how does the sum of the left digits correlate to the right digit
 Skwerl23: how does 3 relate to 9
 Saad-py: yes 
 Skwerl23: think about it
 Skwerl23: 9/3 =&#160;?
 Skwerl23: you guys are getting close
 Skwerl23: add the left individual digits
 Skwerl23: the right side is a square of the left sum
 DaBestest: I JUST WANT TO SPLIT THE DUMB INTEGER BUT I CAN"T
 Skwerl23: print(sum([int(i) for i in input()]**2)
 Skwerl23: use a string
 Skwerl23: instead of integer
 Skwerl23: python can iterate strings
 DaBestest: i tried that...i'm working on that
 Skwerl23: sorry my syntax is broken
 Skwerl23: print(sum([int(i) for i in input()])**2)
 Skwerl23: or 
 DaBestest: no, ur good... i'm bad at putting it all in one line likethat...
 Skwerl23: n = input()
 DaBestest: yep, rn I have
 Saad-py: Thanks for the answer
 DaBestest: n=str(input()).split()
 Skwerl23: y=0
 Skwerl23: for i in x:y+=x
 kalier: Python？
 Skwerl23: print(y**2)
 Skwerl23: yea it's python
 Saad-py: yessir
 DaBestest: but my strs and ints aren't converting well lol
 Saad-py: lol
 Skwerl23: for i in x: y+=int(x)
 Saad-py: reclash
 DaBestest: OH... I just looked at ur code
 Skwerl23: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/155753301dd04d36d1b2248fc8ca48ab29a44a5">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/155753301dd04d36d1b2248fc8ca48ab29a44a5</a>

 Saad-py: BYE
 jrke: happy caturday
 Skwerl23: took me s econd
 Skwerl23: oh it was shortest?
 Skwerl23: dammit
 Skwerl23: lmao
 DaBestest: yeah...
 DaBestest: i didn't realize either
 Skwerl23: i would have owned lmao
 DaBestest: yep, lol
 DaBestest: i just normally delete all the extra trash out of there for simplicity lol
 Skwerl23: math.floor == //2
 DaBestest:&#160;?
 Skwerl23: so whats 7/2
 DaBestest: I was wondering why you did // instead of just /
 DaBestest: 3.5..?
 Skwerl23: i'm teaching you
 Skwerl23: yea
 DaBestest: ok
 Skwerl23: 7//2 = 3
 DaBestest: oh... i knew that... way back in my deep files of my brain lmao
 Skwerl23: lmao
 Skwerl23: i wish i knew it was shortest
 Skwerl23: i would have probably gotten 95ish
 DaBestest: welp that the easier way to do it
 Skwerl23: if not way less
 Skwerl23: dammit
 DaBestest: 95ish what?
 Skwerl23: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/155753951a250bdac24d4debbd34bb6547b8414">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/155753951a250bdac24d4debbd34bb6547b8414</a>
 Skwerl23: characters
 Skwerl23: that one is shortest guaranteed
 Skwerl23: anyone else wanna join? mr. caturday?
 DaBestest: oh
 Saad-py: backed up
 Saad-py: DAbestest any way I can talk yo u
 DaBestest: i just sent you a priv saad
 Saad-py: How
 Saad-py: Whee
 Saad-py: how I am new to coc
 DaBestest: lol
 Saad-py: ok
 Saad-py: i got it
 Skwerl23: 104 characters
 Saad-py: bruh I can't find a way to do this
 DaBestest: I'm slowly but surely plodding along lol
 DaBestest: if ur using python, this helps: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=display">http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=display</a>
 Saad-py: 9 chars
 DaBestest: it works when i plug it into a visualizer, but not in the coc
 Saad-py: but 25%
 DaBestest: but only 25%
 Saad-py: print(35)    #LMAO
 Skwerl23: lol
 Skwerl23: not a good coding practice
 Saad-py: HAHAHAH
 DaBestest: that used to be me all the time tho
 Saad-py: Imma try this
 DaBestest: now i think abt the problem all day lol
 Saad-py: lol
 Saad-py: hacker101.com
 Skwerl23: true hacking is problem solving
 cantcodehelp: i think the second testcase is wrong @DaBestest
 Skwerl23: it's not
 DaBestest:&#160;?

 Saad-py: oof
 Saad-py: Bye\
 DaBestest: oof
 cantcodehelp: i've done it manually, that sum isn't 147 
 DaBestest: oh,funny
 Skwerl23: well, my code got it 
 DaBestest: omg lol
 cantcodehelp: not well, dunno 
 DaBestest: mine kept getting an EOF error and idek why lol
 cantcodehelp: not really a python guy, but seems like the same idea, however mine didn't get it right
 Skwerl23: that happens When you ask for too many inputs
 Skwerl23: you had input() in a loop on n didn't you
 Skwerl23: or two loops
 DaBestest: yeah, but that's how it was from the very beginnign
 Skwerl23: range(s)
 Skwerl23: not n
 Skwerl23: it was poorly written
 DaBestest: oh, duh that's why it kept getting it wrong
 DaBestest: yeah, ik
 Skwerl23: maybe i did it wrong
 DaBestest: wait, my code or the problem?
 Skwerl23: i'm drunk
 DaBestest: classy
 Skwerl23: the second number was likely length of strings
 DaBestest: probably my code
 DaBestest: oh
 Skwerl23: and i got lucky he had the same length as lines or something
 DaBestest: ohh
 Skwerl23: he probably made squares
 Skwerl23: it was probably n-1
 Skwerl23: in his logic
 DaBestest: i tried doing that but i still got errors
 Skwerl23: rate it poorly
 Skwerl23: i used s and got 100%
 DaBestest: k
 Skwerl23: for shortest
 Skwerl23: replace tabs with spaces
 Skwerl23: one single space per tab
 DaBestest: oh
 DaBestest: that makes sense
 DaBestest: i just try to combine stuff on to one line if i can
 Skwerl23: you would have had 21 less characters
 Skwerl23: yea, CoC made me a LOT better at single line
 DaBestest: yeah, but it didn't really matter
 Skwerl23: but not perfect
 Skwerl23: don't try to beat me
 Skwerl23: try to beat you
 DaBestest: i'm awful at single line and code golf stuff

 Skwerl23: you didn't learn the stuff i just taught you on your own
 DaBestest: :joy:
 DaBestest: Guys, this has been fun, but it's late and I can't think straight abt code rn. This truly made my day though, and I can't wait to check out some of that hacking stuff.
 Saad-py: Same here
 Skwerl23: find me on m.me/skwerl23
 DaBestest: Alrighty, see ya later.
 DaBestest: i don't do messenger, I will talk to you through the priv codingame chats tho
 Skwerl23: hold on
 Skwerl23: pm me
 vincent-blyat: yo
 Skwerl23: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/">https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/</a>
 Skwerl23: that's the roadmap to white hat hacking/analyst certifications
 cantcodehelp: looks like at least 2 days worth of studying
 Skwerl23: at least
 Skwerl23: i have OSCP
 Skwerl23: and that alone took 450 hours to earn
 DaBestest: bye guys, talk to you agin sometime soon... I'll probably be on more often now
 Skwerl23: i have 3 sans certs, 1 of them was easy, but the other 2 took probably 200-225 hours
 Skwerl23: each
 Skwerl23: the easy one was around 80 hours
 Skwerl23: with college, i've never done the math but around 5000 hours of training.
 Skwerl23: it never ends in cyber security
 cantcodehelp: i don't think it ever ends in anything really 
 cantcodehelp: you're constantly learning
 Skwerl23: in IT, if you're good
 Skwerl23: yes
 Skwerl23: trust me, i have had plenty of subordinates that didn't go far, because they didn't want to learn
 Skwerl23: but Cyber Security requires infinite training, it's why i tell people to learn all the basics, and find what you love, then specialize, cause you'll drive yourself mad with training
 cantcodehelp: everyone learns daily, to what extent is up to them :sweat_smile:
 Skwerl23: lies
 Skwerl23: people CAN learn daily
 Skwerl23: and many do
 Skwerl23: but trust me, many don't
 Skwerl23: otherwise we wouldn't have people attacking the capitol
 cantcodehelp: cybersecurity might be a special case tbh, i assume you have to be up to date with everything in order to be efficient 
 Skwerl23: the stuff they're learning is not knowledge
 Skwerl23: it's not as crazy as you think
 cantcodehelp: ha, you're from us? :sweat_smile:
 Skwerl23: many of the up to date stuff is automated
 cantcodehelp: that capitol stuff was crazy 
 Skwerl23: yes, and if you think those people learn daily, oh man
 kalier: haha
 philRG: @Skwerl23 nice roadmap, but this is a no-go imho or if you have 30 years in learning.
 philRG: these acronyms have been created for organizations specialized in e-learning

 Saad-py: Hey
 Saad-py: @Skewrl
 jacek: finally someone at chess is trying
 eulerscheZahl: and that someone isn't you it seems
 WoIf: anyone help with code4life
 egaetan: Wolf&#160;? maybe i can
 egaetan: what's your question&#160;?
 WoIf: connect what for lab
 WoIf: what input is id for lab
 WoIf: I used sampleIid but error invalid connect you are not carrying sample 2
 egaetan: it is sampleId
 egaetan: you should have something wrong with the ids you are carrying
 Angecide: I feel like the uttt leaderboard might be a bit too random
 Angecide: it feels like I am submitting the same bot, but now I am 29th for some reason
 Angecide: but before I was like 40 or something
 Angecide: I guess, with random moves and some people getting timeouts and such, luck is a small factor in placement as well
 MSmits: Angecide it's not the random moves
 MSmits: it's mostly that bots are close in strength
 MSmits: the moves aren't actually random, the random rollouts are random, but the statistics gathered from this can be quite deterministic, only having 2 or 3 reasonable options each turn
 MSmits: imagine if you have 30 bots close to eachother on the leaderboard that are exactly equally strong. What rank would one get?
 Angecide: yeah that's true, when people are placed too close to each other, even small changes can have big impact in placement
 MSmits: thats what happens. Mostly it's because creativity in the search algorithm has only a small impact on the bot
 MSmits: a few people stand out because they found some heuristics that help, but most people just stick with basic mcts
 MSmits: and the difference is then mostly due to performance and even if you have 10-20% more sims, it will not affect winrate all that much
 MSmits: from my tests, if i halved my simcount vs myself, the bot would go from 50% to 40% winrate
 geppoz: python question: it is safe to call .remove in a for loop on the same looping object?
 geppoz: the loop will iterate any item still?
 MSmits: not sure if it is allowed, but it's not safe
 MSmits: generally if you have to do that, make sure to count backwards
 geppoz: i mean without counting:
 geppoz: for item in array:
 MSmits: that's not gonna work
 MSmits: i think
 jacek: :scream:
 geppoz:   if ...: array.remove(item)
 jacek: im gonna call python police
 geppoz: for item in array:
 geppoz: if ...: array.remove(item)
 geppoz: :D
 eulerscheZahl: jacek he stole your #1 troll spot right there
 geppoz: it seems to work fine
 geppoz: just wondering if always safe
 MSmits: thats even worse imho
 MSmits: it works but you dont know why :P
 VizGhar: :D 
 BlaiseEbuth: Like the whole python...
 geppoz: :D
 eulerscheZahl: JS is more of a mystery to me
 MSmits: Why === that?
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course, js has the palm
 MSmits: you mean like a tree BlaiseEbuth?
 MSmits: :palm_tree:&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: Meh. I have to verify words before using them in english... ^^'
 jacek: has the palm - leading the way&#160;:?
 BlaiseEbuth: Doesn't 'palm' used to designate a prestigious prize in english&#160;? like  "academic palm"
 MSmits: sounds vaguely familiar
 MSmits: js has the market, you probably meant
 MSmits: or the monopoly
 Astrobytes: Medal BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: I meant the "gold medal" in the mysteries category.
 geppoz: or crown
 eulerscheZahl: my first thought when I read "palm": ":palm_tree: or :hand:?
 eulerscheZahl: :hand:
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: :hand_splayed:

 eulerscheZahl: i would completely fail in any quiz show like "who wants to be a millionaire"
 MSmits: thats an easy question  euler, just say me
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that show has more questions for you
 MSmits: owww
 eulerscheZahl: about movies, music and such culture stuff
 MSmits: its weird for me to watch those
 MSmits: i dont know half the answers at least
 MSmits: and then comes a physics or math question and i am disgusted by how easy it is
 eulerscheZahl: i would ace some of the questions where contestants really struggle
 eulerscheZahl: and then at the "easy" ones that they can quickly answer, i would fail hard
 MSmits: well i can probably answer the easy ones, I live with a normal person
 MSmits: sometimes we socialize and i learn this stuff
 geppoz: in Italy it is a shame to ignore everything, but the math/physics&#160;:(
 MSmits: thats why you're here geppoz
 MSmits: we love you here
 geppoz: I mean for example our managers, they will be ashamed if they didnt know the year of the America's discovery
 geppoz: but they naturally said "I know anything of math"
 eulerscheZahl: i go with 1498
 geppoz: without shame
 geppoz: wrong man :D
 eulerscheZahl: but close :P
 eulerscheZahl: if you see Columbus as the discoverer
 eulerscheZahl: October 12, 1492
 geppoz: he was just someone got lost :D
 eulerscheZahl: just 1 click away. but understanding how maths works is a much longer process
 eulerscheZahl: and more fruitful to do something with the understanding
 MSmits: very true
 geppoz: oops, I meant: but they naturally said "I know nothing of math"
 geppoz: without shame
 geppoz: sad story
 eulerscheZahl: I got the message after a short confusion
 geppoz: :D
 eulerscheZahl: you failed logic :P
 geppoz: I failed english&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but it's common for major parts of our society&#160;:(perfectly acceptable to say that you hated math in school while you get odd looks for some other subjects
 geppoz: that's another thing to be ashemed of, and here it is not so much
 geppoz: (to fail english)
 eulerscheZahl: my mom helped my niece with 2nd grade math homework, i coincidentally saw it
 eulerscheZahl: and my mom was like "that's a hard one, you probably won't get it"
 eulerscheZahl: how encouraging
 geppoz: :D in 8 minutes I'm going to teach geometry to my niece too
 eulerscheZahl: which grade? old enough to be slightly interesting?
 geppoz: I mean, university geometry (vector spaces)
 eulerscheZahl: ok, that's fine
 eulerscheZahl: I admire teachers willing to explain the most basic things year after year
 geppoz: geometry was the first exam in my electronic engineering studies, wonderful teacher
 Rddevelop: is there a way to get back to a clash of code after time is over?

 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: imagine someone copying the full statement and the search taking 15s to process the query
 MSmits: ow
 MSmits: just cap it
 MSmits: who would need more than 5 words anyway
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds like a hacky way
 MSmits: ignore everything after 5
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i'd rather do a proper search but i don't feel like it
 geppoz: the meaning of more words is "AND" or "OR"&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: right now i search the full database (1400 contributions) for each of the words in the query
 eulerscheZahl: and then do an AND after
 MSmits: well bubblesort also works fine for small numbers&#160;: )
 MSmits: dont overengineer it
 eulerscheZahl: and creepy stalking toad tells you that Rddevelop searched for "tower"
 geppoz: (no, that was mine try)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 geppoz: (dunno why it was the word that came into my mind???)
 jacek: so you would fail the efficient search clash
 MSmits: your towering intellect geppoz
 geppoz: no it is from the puzzle of the week
 eulerscheZahl: at least i finally migrated from sqlite to postgres
 derjack: 1900 :tada: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/info/player.jsp?plid=140575">https://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/info/player.jsp?plid=140575</a>
 trictrac: well done jacek&#160;!!
 eulerscheZahl: niceis it allowed to use bots there?
 jacek: dunno, i havent been banned yet
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: it does say "derjack-bot"
 MSmits: it's not like you're hiding it :P
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os4DcbpL0Nc&amp;ab_channel=CodeBullet">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os4DcbpL0Nc&amp;ab_channel=CodeBullet</a>
 jacek: i saw other _bots
 eulerscheZahl: did you fight those bots?
 jacek: no, i dont know how
 eulerscheZahl: and how do you communicate with bot-website?manual process?
 jacek: if possible
 jacek: html parsing
 jacek: its 'correspondence' only 24h to move, but i use only about 10 seconds per move
 eulerscheZahl: ah. so nothing close to real time
 jacek: no&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: how many games can you start at once?
 jacek: at most i had 5 games
 jacek: registered august last year and played 36 games so far
 eulerscheZahl: those are noob numbers :P
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.sokobanonline.com/community/profile/eulerschezahl">https://www.sokobanonline.com/community/profile/eulerschezahl</a>
 eulerscheZahl: 1560 boards solved in 5h of playtime
 MSmits: werent you sokobanned from there?
 eulerscheZahl: no, i stopped because i realized that i'm violating their ToS
 jacek: you dont read ToS?
 eulerscheZahl: stopping before entering top10 and getting noticed
 eulerscheZahl: i read them while my bot was solving
 eulerscheZahl: tried to use my bot on sokoban.info first
 eulerscheZahl: but managed to send an invalid solution with an extremely short path and get #1
 eulerscheZahl: so that was boring
 MSmits: ahh I see
 struct: hello
 MSmits: hi
 struct: Just need to make player ui now I think
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/YesAHCk.png">https://i.imgur.com/YesAHCk.png</a>
 MSmits: looks like funky checkers
 1400179: I suggest to use texture instead of primitives
 1400179: Your circles are extremely pixelated
 struct: I guess I can do that
 struct: you are right
 1400179: Sorry if it's harsh criticism, you wouldn't believe the time I spent getting the chess pieces just right :p
 1400179: OCD or something
 MSmits: well if they are placeholders for something else, it's ok right?
 struct: Well I wouldnt have changed
 struct: but criticism is good
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: i thought you were going with queens
 1400179: I would also make the squares more distinguished from the background
 MSmits: yeah
 1400179: Maybe a less depressing color palette too
 struct: I also agree with that, I need to find something else for background
 trictrac: Hello reCurse, in chess it seems that all the taken material is not fully displayed in the ui&#160;?
 1400179: Uh? Do you have an example?
 trictrac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/523806459">https://www.codingame.com/replay/523806459</a>
 1400179: Ohh
 1400179: Got it
 1400179: I only display the deltas
 trictrac: ok fine
 1400179: If both sides captured 2 pawns I don't see the point of displaying them
 1400179: Maybe should have made that an option
 jacek: what a mess. who aproved it
 1400179: That's how many chess websites do it...
 trictrac: I just not see that was the delta only. It's OK like that
 MSmits: reCurse, upgrade troll recognition software
 MSmits: include a heuristic: If(sender == jacek)
 1400179: Meh
 MSmits: that chess replay looks like a serious chess game now
 1400179: Getting there&#160;:)
 MSmits: other replays i saw looked worse than noob :P
 MSmits: not easy to make a chess bot
 1400179: There is so much information out there though it kind of balances out
 jacek: i still need to implement castling, en passant and draw by repetition
 jacek: and switch to birboards
 jacek: bitboards even
 MSmits: bitboards are a lot harder too, in chess
 MSmits: compared to those simpler board games
 1400179: Depends
 MSmits: i should say, a lot more work, not necessarily hard
 1400179: If you want to make them as efficient as possible sure
 1400179: Just to get something basic going, not much harder than othello
 MSmits: just more bitboards. All I need for othello is two uint64_t
 1400179: Sure
 1400179: I'm kind of stumped, my NN is kind of mediocre at evaluating positions
 1400179: Could be a lot of things
 jacek: just like human
 MSmits: well... chess is a far more complicated game. 
 1400179: You know it's funny
 1400179: I get the impression my NN would do better at chess than othello
 struct: How do NNs handle end games on chess?
 struct: without tablebases
 1400179: Probably badly
 MSmits: that seems really hard
 1400179: But by then you don't need an eval anymore
 MSmits: depends on the endgame and how close it is
 MSmits: some endgames take 100 moves to finish
 MSmits: or more
 trictrac: the problem is to put NN coef in 100 Ko char with so much char to do the move generator in bitboard
 1400179: Man I really don't understand why this keeps getting brought up
 1400179: There is no issue with code size
 1400179: You'll hit runtime issues way before you fill that size
 MSmits: mmh in your case
 MSmits: maybe you just did it better
 MSmits: Robo did mention using the full amount
 MSmits: could be with chess the bottleneck is runtime issues and if you had more resources, it would also have problems with codesize. 
 1400179: Well if you do NNUE I guess you could hit size issues
 MSmits: and if you had more codesize, it would have problems training and making use of it 
 1400179: But really the basis is with 50 or 100 ms on a single cpu core
 1400179: You really can't do much
 MSmits: yeah, i keep hearing about 3k sims or something
 1400179: By the time you hit code size you'll have like 10 sims or something lol
 1400179: Of course you need to abuse CG as much as possible but still
 MSmits: hmm so there is actually a tradeoff here
 MSmits: do you try to make your NN smaller so it is faster?
 MSmits: less nodes, more sims
 1400179: Not a committed decision but yes
 1400179: I could fit much larger NNs in my bots
 1400179: But the number of sims would drop so much I don't think it's worth it
 MSmits: it might be worth experimenting though
 MSmits: to be sure where the optimum lies
 1400179: Sure
 1400179: The thing is
 1400179: There are so many such hyperparameters
 1400179: And you never really know whether more training would do it or not
 MSmits: yeah I suppose so
 1400179: So you always have way more possibilities than you have compute to experiment
 1400179: So you have to choose
 MSmits: so what you're saying actually. Is that I can both make a small NN and have an opening book too
 1400179: Only if you're despicable
 MSmits: got it
 jacek: well i could use more codesize
 jacek: my NN is sparse input and the speed vs size isnt issue (except maybe for some cache missing)
 jacek: its like having bigger n-tuples doesn't slow you down
 MSmits: having a 10 seed db instead of 9 seed db in oware did slow me down due to cache issues
 MSmits: it looks up the win when a leaf hits the seed limit
 1400179: I think a lot of what makes CG unique is to work with very tight constraints
 MSmits: i kinda like that
 jacek: and many games on CG after all. littlegolem's correspodence games isnt enough
 1400179: I mean sure you have better bots with huge tablebases
 1400179: But it makes me kinda meh...
 1400179: Same with books
 MSmits: generating the tablebases themselves is a real skill also. for oware I generate them in first second
 MSmits: its not even in codesize
 1400179: I'm somehow fine with that?
 MSmits: I don't know, are you?
 1400179: Yeah
 MSmits: for bandas i generated them offline, the end game tables
 MSmits: its too complicated in that case to do it fast
 MSmits: fits in 27 kb so its fine
 1400179: Definition of tight constraint is arbitrary
 1400179: Fits mine though
 1400179: If you can make it run on CG
 MSmits: right
 1400179: Book is different because it destroys the generalization
 1400179: Though not sure why they would be different than tablebases fundamentally
 MSmits: depending on how you generate it imho
 MSmits: i do 2 kinds
 MSmits: general books (doing one for connect 4)
 MSmits: and targeted books
 MSmits: the second is somewhat cheesy yes
 1400179: I guess I'd have to be against hardcoded tablebase to also be against hardcoded books
 struct: I rather face tablebases than books
 MSmits: there's a grey area, but sometimes you can go so far into the grey its nearly black
 MSmits: thats what me in old john did to othello
 MSmits: me and
 MSmits: honestly, general books will never be enough to beat an obviously stronger bot
 MSmits: but focused books can beat any deterministic bot and even somewhat more random bots
 1400179: Yeah there's no question focused books are definitely dumb
 MSmits: some games on CG are so simple though, that even a focused book becomes general enough to beat even pretty random strong bots
 MSmits: because the amount of good moves is just too low
 1400179: Screw books, doesn't matter the kind
 MSmits: we should keep encouraging randomized starts when it is at all useful
 MSmits: like your chess 
 1400179: Not my chess tbh
 1400179: Chess players faced that issue way before bots existed :p
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: I remember kasparov complaining he didnt have the time to prepare vs deep blue
 MSmits: thats basically saying he didnt have time to generate a book
 MSmits: in his head
 MSmits: they gave him games played by an earlier version
 MSmits: which of course were different. The same way Robo changing a parameter screws up my hardcoded moves :P
 1400179: Well I can't speak for him but from what I gathered, it wasn't necessarily about conventional preparation
 1400179: He wanted to prepare unusual lines
 MSmits: oh right, anti-engine chess
 1400179: So countering deep blue book
 1400179: But not against deep blue preference
 1400179: Just to avoid that hardcoding advantage
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: well also the eval might be biased some way that can be exploited
 1400179: That he wouldn't know
 MSmits: thats probably hard indeed, he could find that the bot makes mistakes in certain situations though
 1400179: What you do know is a GM who remembers more theory can come out stronger in the midgame
 1400179: Even throwing curveball opening is a thing for the same reason
 MSmits: right
 1400179: Fischer basically claimed chess was dying because of all that opening theory
 1400179: That's why he invented 960
 MSmits: well it's not a particularly attractive part of the game imho.
 jacek: and the one saying that is... ^
 MSmits: me?
 MSmits: well there's two different things: A) what is effective and B) what is fun
 jacek: :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: solar glasses guy is B
 MSmits: the opening stuff, hardcoding moves etc. is very effective and makes you win, but notnecessarily fun
 MSmits: i like it for some games if they are particulary interesting, but not generally
 MSmits: so having to choose between winning and having fun is kind of annoying. Which is why i also prefer the random start games now
 1400179: Solar glasses guy?
 1400179: Oh nvm
 jacek: :B
 jrke: i am trying to run offline referee so how can i add cpp file as agent?
 struct: brutaltester?
 jrke: no 
 struct: you are using sdk for it?
 struct: just compile the cpp file
 jrke: offline referee
 jrke: gameRunner.setAgent("");
 jrke: what should be inside it
 struct: "path\compiled.exe"
 jrke: "/simulation.exe"
 jrke: not working ^^
 struct: thats not the entire path is it?
 jrke: its saved in same folder still it needs whole path?
 struct: try it
 jrke: oh thanks working now
 struct: Also you can run a batch of games easil

 struct: scroll to testing part
 jrke: thanks
 jrke: its showing me timeout in turn 1 everytime
 struct: does your bot use a lot of time?
 jrke: no 
 jrke: does it needs any libgcc_s_gwc2.dll
 struct: no idea, I use msvc on windows
 jrke: fixed 2 lib files were needed
 M3T4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/15582268e8b1748b13d3403b6d3da5deebd8270">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/15582268e8b1748b13d3403b6d3da5deebd8270</a>
 M3T4: anybody interested in c C++ clash
 jacek: c++ shortest?
 M3T4: as long as evrybody is using c++
 NotPiro: does any1 know how the score for CoC ranking is calculated?
 Skynse: in fastest mode, its based on who can finish the fastest
 Skynse: But the base ranking system is how far you complete the test cases
 NotPiro: i understand that the better you perform, the better the score, but is the algo for it public?
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill</a> 
 Skynse: only if you show your code
 struct: its based on your opponent rank
 NotPiro: ok thnx guys
 NotPiro: btw under what rank is usually considered decent?
 Skynse: In clash of code?
 NotPiro: yes
 Skynse: I usually aim for first
 NotPiro: not in a match, like the global leaderboard rank
 Skynse: oh
 Skynse: ohhh you mean that rank
 NotPiro: yeah
 Skynse: level or rank name? could you specify?
 NotPiro: ok when i go to the CoC compete page i see my ranking&#160;: 326(th)/206015
 eulerscheZahl: most of those 200k aren't actively clashing anymore
 eulerscheZahl: so they slowly drop
 NotPiro: my ranking is way too low, (mostly bcz of inactive users)  and that's why i was asking how low is good 
 eulerscheZahl: good is relative
 Skynse: my rank is 7,178
 Skynse: pretty decent I'd say
 NotPiro: true good is relative, so what's good for you? i just wanted opinions
 Skynse: Ive mostly been doing CoC so there's no huge change I think
 M3T4: so i have to clash with the best if i want to climb the ranks faster
 struct: yes
 M3T4: does provate clashes count&#160;?
 moshema: idk think so
 moshema: i see majority are in python
 M3T4: when the questions are too easy i don't stand a chance with c++
 moshema: How the question difficulty level measure? is it random?
 Wontonimo: Skynse: you can check out other users rank by clicking on their profile and seeing what there CoC rank is.  If it looks like it has dropped recently but otherwise they have high rankings in other things, then like euler said, they just haven't been active so don't count it.
 struct: if you wanna be competitive on coc you cant use c++
 struct: maybe in 1% of the clashes you might be as fast
 Wontonimo: M3T4: it's not just about clashing with the best to climb.  Losing against someone with a way lower trueskill will set you back a lot.  Generally, aim to be consistent and to do better than you did last week and you'll go up in rank.
 notofyourinterest: how do you become a mod?
 Wontonimo: have you checked out the profiles of the mods?  Pretty badass.  Focus on getting there first&#160;:) 
 struct: most of the mods are very active users
 M3T4: that's exacty what's happening to me i rise slowly to 1000th then i fall on shortest and i'm back to 2000
 M3T4: guess i'll keep playing hoping i dont get shortest code 
 Velcoro: I was exactly in that situation half a year ago (Kotlin, Java).. so I learned Perl, now I love shortest&#160;:)
 Totomns: same here, i'm used to writing in C/C++ at work, but after being defeated at code golf, i prefered js
 reCurse: Asking how to be mod is a guaranteed way to never become one
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: how to be a mod?
 jacek: how not to be a mod?
 Astrobytes: Be you.
 MSmits: trust jacek to make it shakespearean
 MSmits: yay my beamsearch works. I tested it on the 5 character validator
 MSmits: it had the same length though =/
 VizGhar: which puzzle?
 MSmits: code of the ring
 DomiKo: the worst one
 MSmits: I love it
 Astrobytes: Well, it works.
 VizGhar: oh nice I kinda hate optim... but working now on Mars3 maybe I'll find some little space in my heart for those
 MSmits: I like them, i am just not as good at them as botting
 VizGhar: but still congrats on every little achievement :P
 MSmits: less tools in the box
 VizGhar: ++
 reCurse: Kinda ironic coming from one of the most hardcoders
 reCurse: :P
 MSmits: mmh without NN I can beat you at uttt
 reCurse: Allegedly
 Astrobytes: Post-truth
 MSmits: you know I am unreasonably honest
 reCurse: Except you had no way to determine that
 MSmits: ah, well all i did was remove my book and do a cg bench vs your leaderboard version
 MSmits: small edge, not that much
 reCurse: My LB version was the most specific booked bot ever created
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: well it's not just uttt anyway, also beat every non NN on oware
 MSmits: without book
 reCurse: Besides where is that coming from anyway
 DomiKo: Ok how leaderboard work. Why there are so many battles with 10 bots in arena?
 Astrobytes: But NN-beating on Oware was the goal
 MSmits: still is Astrobytes
 reCurse: I was just saying you enjoy hardcoding stuff so it's kind of ironic you wouldn't enjoy optims
 jacek: what arena with 10 only?
 DomiKo: Chess
 Astrobytes: Indeed MSmits
 MSmits: reCurse it's the reverse, i dont enjoy hardcoding and i do enjoy optims&#160;:)
 jacek: it was always 90&#160;:?
 MSmits: the fact that i hardcode does not mean i enjoy it. I just do it cuz it wins :P
 jacek: said the biggest book(m)er ever
 reCurse: Yeah seriously lol
 reCurse: I call bs sorry
 MSmits: well to be completely fair, i like it with yavalath
 MSmits: dislike it with most other games, but it works
 Astrobytes: It wasn't Smits who said he didn't enjoy optims
 MSmits: no i loved numbershifting
 MSmits: and some others
 MSmits: also the hardcoding is different from doing it in bots imho
 MSmits: you're not trying to hardcode an entire game tree with optims
 MSmits: just a few solutions calculated offline
 MSmits: and sure, the fact that it is offline, creates a large advantage, but a smart algo is still hugely important
 MSmits: I ran samegame for 2 weeks or so and did not get a very good score at all
 MSmits: cuz my algo sucked
 DomiKo: 100% true
 DomiKo: jacek I can't checkmate you&#160;:(
 MSmits: oh I see the confusion now. I do like using meta mcts a lot. That's not the same as hardcoding though, the hardcoding is a product of it. But the meta mcts itself is interesting because you discover things about the game you're researching
 reCurse: I was using it as an umbrella term yes
 MSmits: ah ok, good that thats cleared up then
 Astrobytes: Still hardcoding though :P
 reCurse: Offline computing doesn't quite cut it because it includes training and such
 reCurse: So apologies for my limited vocabulary
 Astrobytes: Limited vocabulary my ass&#160;:)
 reCurse: Your posterior
 MSmits: no worries. Personally, I think creating a general opening book isn't any more cheesy than training a bot in any way. It's the targeting of specific opponents that is cheesy
 reCurse: It is though
 MSmits: how so
 jacek: mhm i wonder if othello had many more strong users your books would stand any chance
 MSmits: it would jacek, othello is so simple, i can encode probably the entire tree of good moves into it 
 MSmits: i am using 1% of codesize
 MSmits: currently
 reCurse: How is that not cheesy
 Astrobytes: Is struc t gonna do the forced openings
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 struct: I cant do it without breaking the bots
 Astrobytes: And yeah, that is 100% cheese
 MSmits: it is reCurse, but i am still targeting players when i do that, it's just that with 100 players, many of them would be using the same moves
 MSmits: they already do now
 Astrobytes: Even with a new league struct?
 reCurse: Well I'm assuming at that point it would become a generalized book
 reCurse: Which is where you draw the distinction
 reCurse: And where I don't see one
 jacek: i like making generalizing opening book
 MSmits: there is one for more complex games though
 MSmits: yeah and jaceks books are far less effective because of this
 MSmits: i think they are fine
 struct: I could open a new league sure
 jacek:&#160;:(
 struct: but still I dont want to release a very strong bot
 MSmits: i mean you're not doign cheesy stuff jacek
 struct: due to bug
 MSmits: thats good :P
 jacek: only chessy stuff
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: struct do you mean you're afraid the boss code will be stealable
 VizGhar: Hmm can somebody help me? writing simulator for mars lander. vSpeed and hSpeed are computed correctly, but X and Y coordinates not :thinking: why should possibly x += hSpeed be incorrect?
 reCurse: I'm not convinced othello is fixable anyway
 VizGhar: *not be correct
 reCurse: Something about input being completely wrong VizGhar
 reCurse: You have to ignore it
 reCurse: It uses float but gives you int
 VizGhar: yeez i fixed correct statement with statement with same meaning :D
 struct: yes MSmits
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/645/713/888.jpg">https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/645/713/888.jpg</a>
 MSmits: a reasonable fear i guess
 Astrobytes: On that note (stealable boss) can it not be obfuscated?
 MSmits: obfuscated still leaves it to be copy pastable
 reCurse: What bug, it's still downloadable even if you don't put the game as downloadable?
 struct: yes reCurse
 reCurse: Uh
 reCurse: Can someone steal chess boss and send it to me in PM
 struct: sure
 struct: one sec
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: well suddenly i am happy most bosses are weak :P
 struct: can i put it in a private apstebin reCurse?
 struct: and pm it?
 reCurse: Yes
 jacek: pm the hash
 zhoubou: Nice one
 1400179: lol what a joke
 1400179: ffs CG
 1400179: Glad I didn't put anything sensitive there
 jacek: huh
 struct: This was reported
 Astrobytes: oh you beat me
 Astrobytes:&#160;:(
 MSmits: struct be careful you dont post here how it works
 struct: long ago, first by euler if I recall
 struct: sure
 reCurse: Yeah and it was supposedly fixed after
 reCurse: smh
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: Yep. I think it happened during BR
 struct: the fix was to delete the code manually
 struct: by cg
 reCurse: Oh so it got fixed manually but not at the source
 reCurse: wow
 Astrobytes: Yeah, something about the princess is in the other castle or some other Mario reference
 struct: I was not aware of this when Ive asked for a boss code for othello
 struct: otherwise i would never have asked
 Astrobytes: (the text they replaced it with)
 Astrobytes: I wasn't aware until euler told me relatively recently.
 1400179: Whatever, 5% concerns anyway
 MSmits: should this be hard to fix?
 Astrobytes: Obfuscation?
 struct: Well I got an official answer
 struct: Not sure if I should say it though :S
 jacek: hm?
 struct: euler reported it first, but i also reported it
 struct: when I published othello boss
 BlaiseEbuth: Something like "Fix it yourself 5% guy&#160;!"&#160;? :3
 1400179: If it's official answer then
 1400179: Why hide it
 struct: Well it was on pm
 struct: Basicly its not an easy fix, they will see if it becomes problematic
 MSmits: it's problematic
 struct: no
 struct: because its 5%
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 Astrobytes: Heh.
 Astrobytes: Jeez.
 struct: I dont get on how its not an easy fix but w/e
 VizGhar: jeez, so newX position on mars is obviously not x+new_hsx but x+(old_hsx+new_hsx)/2
 DomiKo: What is it about this 5% thing?
 VizGhar: 5% are competitive guys
 Astrobytes: OK, huge influx of alt accounts abusing boss visibility incoming then? (I am joking, for the record)
 MSmits: DomiKo it's something that came out of the last brainstorm session
 1400179: Competition is more and more defocused because it only represents 5% of what people are interested in CG for, according to their survey
 DomiKo: I tried to read most of it
 1400179: So it became a meme
 DomiKo: nice
 struct: that worked for exp thing Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Not my style though.
 MSmits: doubt westicles would get away with it a second time either :P
 Astrobytes: Can't argue the apparent efficacy.
 Astrobytes: I now appreciate the 'making a lot of noise' thing.
 1400179: Doesn't always work
 1400179: I'm done with noise
 MSmits: no, dont shout "four more years" if you want it fixed quickly
 MSmits: "stop the steal" might work though
 Astrobytes: Agreed. Focused noise. I'm not a fan of doing it all in public tbh.
 Astrobytes: Even then, what's the point these days.
 struct: Well it wasnt my idea to discuss this in the chat
 struct: My fault
 MSmits: dont worry about it struct
 Astrobytes: Ah no, I didn't mean you or this chat struct
 Astrobytes: General methods of 'getting CG to listen' is what I mean.
 struct: I dont feel bad about it, I just think creator should be aware of it
 struct: creators*
 MSmits: yeah definitely
 MSmits: currently the guy creating connect4 is trying to write a strong bot
 MSmits: to make 2 leagues
 Astrobytes: Oh is that why he went quiet?
 jacek: it doesnt need to be strong
 reCurse: Hmm I think NN should be much easier on C4
 MSmits: yeah he put it back up 
 Astrobytes: Cool.
 MSmits: well you can test it now reCurse
 reCurse: I'm not done with othello yet
 reCurse: Almost though
 jacek: *5 years later*
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: i'm not counterbooking anyone on connect4, I promise
 Astrobytes: Echoes of UTTT....
 struct: just make an ai that beats random
 struct: its more than enough
 reCurse: No I think I've found the answers I was looking for as far as othello is concerned
 jacek: heuristics?
 MSmits: struct also needs to beat always picking lowest index move or some stuch
 MSmits: such
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: i would just pick 1 reasonable heuristic and then it will beat both those
 MSmits: for connect4, i would go with what i put in my random rollout. Finish wins and avoid giving away wins
 Astrobytes: With regards to which part reCurse? (If you want to say)
 MSmits: endgames i think
 reCurse: Why NN eval was weak
 MSmits: his NN had problems with that
 jacek: and why was that
 reCurse: I already mentioned all that yesterday
 reCurse: You were there I think
 MSmits: because the endgame is volatile and other bots can just solve it
 reCurse: Thanks
 jacek: so you added endgame solver?
 reCurse: Yes
 jacek: meh
 reCurse: Winrate went dramatically up
 MSmits: did you go with ab or PNS or something more creative you dont want to give away?
 Astrobytes: PNS?
 MSmits: proof number search
 reCurse: I didn't do PNS but the inspiration was very good
 reCurse: Thanks for that
 MSmits: np
 Astrobytes: MSmits: I know man ffs, I was in that convo, I was asking if he used it!
 reCurse: Good read, it's rare to see a paper so digestible
 MSmits: lol
 jacek: now read about mcts solver
 Astrobytes: It is a great paper.
 reCurse: I already know mcts solver
 jacek: from that paper right
 Astrobytes: Yeah but the paper is a Must Read,
 reCurse: Which one
 MSmits: the mcst solver paper is fine until you hit the pseudo code
 Astrobytes: ^
 reCurse: Which paper is a must read
 Astrobytes: It's worth looking at just for that.
 Astrobytes: The solver one.
 reCurse: mcts? PNS?
 jacek: a mod wouldnt troll you
 MSmits: mcts i guess
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf</a>
 MSmits: it was a good explanation
 Astrobytes: MCTS solver, sorry.
 reCurse: I thought the mcts solver paper to be quite poor tbh
 Astrobytes: Yes! That's why it's a Must Read.
 MSmits: well i thought the pseudocode was bad, but the explanation was easy to understand
 reCurse: Wait what
 jacek: maybe its just dutch people cant write good paper
 Astrobytes: I  couldn't believe it when I got to the pseudocode and questioned everything I'd thought I'd understood.
 MSmits: nah it's just these guys doing tons of research on these algorithms
 reCurse: lol
 reCurse: So those two papers came from the same guy
 reCurse: Interesting
 MSmits: i think their budget allocation accidentally has one or two zeroes added 
 MSmits: compared to other unis
 Astrobytes: Winands was it?
 reCurse: As much as I thought mcts solver to be meh the PNS one was pretty good
 MSmits: yeah its always winands
 Astrobytes: hehe
 therealbeef: Winands sounds like it could be Belgian too
 Astrobytes: You should meet up with him MSmits
 Astrobytes: Teach him some stuff
 MSmits: well he should come here and learn to use his stuff competitively
 Astrobytes: Yeah reCurse, the PNS paper is good for sure
 reCurse: I really don't think that's what they care about
 MSmits: well their loss
 MSmits: they just dont know what they're missing 
 Astrobytes: Since Rémi is here, maybe they'd listen...
 MSmits: I think they'd be better at their job if they tested their stuff here. Think about how quickly you learned to do stuff here in your free time
 MSmits: competition is  a great motivator
 reCurse: Remi cares about it, just at a much higher level than CG
 Astrobytes: True.
 reCurse: We're the schoolyard of AI
 reCurse: Fighting for king of the sandbox
 reCurse: (or queen, my bad)
 Astrobytes: Doesn't invalidate CG as a useful platform for them though.
 jacek: where else could i test my bots?
 MSmits: on littlegolem :P
 Astrobytes: I mean, CG could - you know - perhaps communicate with them and strike a deal... (nooooot)
 reCurse: Did you just assume their business model
 Astrobytes: Sorry, my bitterness is shining through.
 MSmits: some sciency stuff going on can beef up your reputation
 Astrobytes: Eh. Where's the fun in that.
 MSmits: you did not just say science isnt fun did you
 therealbeef: Half the work of a scientific article is finding the right problem for the theory
 jacek: science is fun except the physics
 Astrobytes: Read between the lines MSmits. For a scientist you do miss a lot :D
 MSmits: lol therealbeef
 reCurse: :thinking:
 MSmits: Astrobytes i cant, it was only 1 line
 Astrobytes: You pedantic little... :D
 MSmits: I try
 MSmits: therealbeef that sounds like mathematical theory
 Astrobytes: I'm also guilty of that particular crime rather often.
 MSmits: or actually no, mathematicians dont even care about practical applications :P
 Astrobytes: Just the mathematics is practical enough
 Astrobytes: Mathematics -&gt; MOAR MATHEMATICS
 Astrobytes: Like theoretical physicists
 MSmits: I dont mind highly abstract math stuff, but there has to be some kind of carrot at the end of the stick, even if the stick is very long
 Astrobytes: They're physicists in theory
 therealbeef: all the major algorithms that dominate on many problems have been found by now. now it's all about a variant on a well-known algorithm and finding the perfect problem on which it outperforms the generic algo by 1%
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/669/">https://xkcd.com/669/</a>
 Astrobytes: lol
 reCurse: I first read genetic algo and was on my way to get triggered, mission aborted
 Astrobytes: therealbeef: but on CG at least (I think it was reCurse who said it earlier? I was afk a lot earlier) the time constraint is the real hurdle.
 reCurse: Uh? I said that for NNs btw
 Astrobytes: It's true (generally) on CG imo
 Astrobytes: Problem-dependent ofc
 Astrobytes: I mean your offline alphabeta is gonna play much better chess with &gt; 50-100ms time limit right.So it pushes you to optimise, think outside the box etc
 Astrobytes: (Optims not included, unless you only do online solvers)
 therealbeef: CG benefits algos where you can tune the time/quality balance
 therealbeef: alphabeta is quite bad here
 reCurse:&#160;??
 jacek:&#160;!!
 Astrobytes: Heh heh heh
 Astrobytes: You're doing it wrong.
 MSmits: reCurse I completely agree on GA. I admit it works, but it repulses me. Much prefer SA
 MSmits: might be the biology themed description
 MSmits: not sure
 <b>**Astrobytes is triggered instantly</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: hehehe
 MSmits: I am supposed to prefer SA, it's physics themed
 Astrobytes: Cause materials/physical chem is SO much better eh! Tell that to a NN :P
 MSmits: mmh good point
 Astrobytes: I jest. I think they both have valid uses.
 MSmits: yeah, GA just doesnt seem appealing to me
 struct: minimax works very well in many games
 MSmits: yet i prefer mcts as well
 Astrobytes: SA can be more of a black art than GA sometimes. GA is good for tuning parameters imo
 DomiKo: GA here is so simple&#160;:( 
 Astrobytes: As opposed to being your main search algo. Again, situation dependent.
 DomiKo: nobody is talking about fancy stuff about GA&#160;:(
 MSmits: many people say GA is simple, but I think that's just because they learned it and used it a lot
 MSmits: SA is much simpler
 1400179: GA pretends to be so much smarter than it is
 therealbeef: with minimax/ab you tend to waste so many ms if you just fail to complete an extra ply within the time limit
 jacek: thats when jacekmax comes int *.*
 jacek: in even
 MSmits: mcts vs minimax is very domain dependent
 MSmits: also calculation time dependent
 MSmits: low calc time -&gt; minimax wins, there's a treshold somewhere
 MSmits: i think if you play uttt with 1ms then mcts would suck
 Astrobytes: 'GA' covers a lot of algorithms tbh, not just a straightup rolling horizon thingy
 Astrobytes: They can get quite sophisticated, not sure I see an application on CG for them though.
 DomiKo: But GA here is equal to RHEA
 DomiKo: that's a problem
 MSmits: whats RHEA again?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's what I'm saying DomiKo
 MSmits: and why is there a "GA here", what about GA is CG specific?
 Astrobytes: Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithm
 DomiKo: if someone is talking about GA
 DomiKo: he is actually talking about RHEA
 MSmits: ahh ok so just a misnomer
 Astrobytes: On here yes.
 MSmits: is either of those two more complicated
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MSmits: do we leave out features here?
 DomiKo: yes GA is more than one algorithm
 Astrobytes: WAy more.
 DomiKo: its like fammily of algorithms
 MSmits: so is RHEA not biology themed then?
 Astrobytes: And a whole field of research too.
 DomiKo: yap it isn't
 MSmits: i should give our "GA" another look at
 Astrobytes: Loosely biology-themed but not overly.
 MSmits: mmh are they rolling animals?
 Astrobytes: No.
 MSmits: mm ok
 DomiKo: more formaly GA is about {0, 1} only
 DomiKo: if I'm not mistaken
 MSmits: thats just binary
 DomiKo: yap
 MSmits: you just described all of computing
 DomiKo: I mean
 DomiKo: our function is {0, 1}^D
 MSmits: ow ok
 DomiKo: so only binnary strings
 DomiKo: yes
 MSmits: ah i see, you encode your solution in a binary string and your population is those strings
 DomiKo: then we got like ES (evolution strategies) which are R^D
 DomiKo: there is a lottttt
 DomiKo: but here(CG) 
 Astrobytes: It's a massive area of research
 MSmits: yeah when i was doing that AI course, the professor was working on that also
 DomiKo: most of problems have Integer Space of something like that
 DomiKo: and in most games more sims = better score&#160;:( 
 MSmits: is that really a fundamental difference, it being integer as opposed to any number?
 Astrobytes: aCat can talk about evolutionary algos if you're interested
 wjan: Question: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/07a1a579-39bc-4528-b6f9-ed30a2155564">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/07a1a579-39bc-4528-b6f9-ed30a2155564</a>
 Astrobytes: wjan: Pastebin isn't working right now
 MSmits: it's question though
 MSmits: perhaps it expired?
 wjan: I'm doing Chuck Norris - Code Golfbut I'm stuck on the third test where the input() is "%". when I do ord(%) i get 37, which in binary is 100101 which in this chuck norris code should be 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 0. However, this is not the right solution. My code worked for the first two tests (where Input() is "C" and "CC"). What am I doing wrong?
 MSmits: the padding
 MSmits: i think
 MSmits: needs to be 8 bit
 Astrobytes: Is this the padding thing? 7 bits
 MSmits: or 7
 MSmits: not sure
 Astrobytes: something like that
 MSmits: so add a zero on the left
 MSmits: or maybe two
 Astrobytes: (pad until required length :P )
 VizGhar: 7 is right
 MSmits: so 100101 becomes 0100101 or 00100101 either of those tow
 MSmits: 0100101 then
 DomiKo: the biggest fundamental difference is search space
 Astrobytes: S**te puzzle lol
 wjan: so every letter needs 8 bit. ok i get it.
 MSmits: it's kind of funny, but silly
 DomiKo: it's so hard to make good eval
 MSmits: the spaces might as well be ones
 DomiKo: that isn't "random"
 jacek: where
 Astrobytes: You mean generally or on CG DomiKo?
 MSmits: wjan it's 7 bits i think
 MSmits: but try both
 DomiKo: on CG
 MSmits: depends a lot on the game/optim doesnt it DomiKo?
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: but in genneral in games you can make like 10 moves and then one BAD move and that's it
 DomiKo: so good solutions aren't "close"
 MSmits: you're talking about the boardgames
 MSmits: or not?
 DomiKo: Mars Lander too
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: numbershifting is like that as well
 MSmits: if you make a mistake it becomes unsolvable
 MSmits: how to score an unsolvable  board?
 MSmits: it's kind of all or nothing
 Astrobytes: I think he's referring more to what makes a good evolvable solution.
 MSmits: yeah, but thats what i mean also
 MSmits: how do you evolve a ns solution
 MSmits: either it works or it doesnt
 DomiKo: that's true too
 MSmits: i'm sure it is possible, but i find it hard to imagine is all
 Astrobytes: I don't think I would use an evolutionary algo on NS tbh
 DomiKo: you can't really measure how far from solution it is
 MSmits: Astrobytes but people use SA and SA is also kind of evolving. You're making changes and scoring them
 MSmits: it's just a 1 population algo
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's not quite the same thing.
 MSmits: it's not, but it has some similar problems in common
 DomiKo: and the best thing CROSSOVER
 MSmits: like how, do you make small changes that do not completely kill any chance of finding a solution
 DomiKo: it's like crossover make only sense when two good solution make good solution
 DomiKo: butt it's most cases it don't
 Astrobytes: Yes. Crossing two excellent solutions often results in F**K ALL :D
 DomiKo: I think that's why most people don't like RHEA 
 DomiKo: and will go with SA
 DomiKo: beacuse it's "the same" but without crossover
 MSmits: i think more use RHEA here
 MSmits: it's more 5% that use SA
 MSmits: the
 MSmits: which is weird to me, because it seems simpler. GA (RHEA) has just been hyped too much
 jacek: use PSO [solved]
 Astrobytes: You did that and found no difference.
 jacek: me?
 MSmits: whats PSO again?
 MSmits: I googled it
 Astrobytes: Particle Swarm Optimisation
 MSmits: no luck
 MSmits: oh
 DomiKo: MSmits always add "algorithm" at the end
 MSmits: this has nothing to do with ants fungus or slime does it?
 MSmits: good point DomiKo
 Astrobytes: Yes jacek, you said you tried it on something on here a while ago
 jacek: ahh right, i think its like GA but more local
 jacek: so like SA
 MSmits: it also has Particle in the name
 MSmits: so might be physics themed?
 jacek: :unamused:
 Astrobytes: Swarms MSmits, swarms.
 MSmits: of particles
 MSmits: like in the LHC
 jacek: today i found nevergrad framework and i think im gonna use it to tune some parameter
 DomiKo: :joy:
 Astrobytes: "Bite my shiny metal ass"
 MSmits: oh thats a bender thing
 MSmits: i will try to do bender after cotr i think
 jacek: bender gender?
 MSmits: fender bender?
 Astrobytes: It's been on my list for some time MSmits. That and Space Maze.
 MSmits: but space maze is a puzzle?
 MSmits: right?
 Astrobytes: Yeah.
 MSmits: I guess puzzles are fun too. I do too few of them
 Astrobytes: But it's kinda optim-y
 MSmits: yeah because otherwise you time out
 Astrobytes: I prefer not-puzzles but it's a good one.
 MSmits: i need to fix my beamsearch. Tried it on a bigger spell in cotr, it does 24 characters correctly, then screws up the last 9
 MSmits: weird bug
 Astrobytes: off by one or something
 MSmits: yeah it might be something like that
 MSmits: but it already goes back and forth a bunch of time and goes over the edge too, no problems till 24
 MSmits: funny that the test case is the exact inverse of the validator and my solution is also the exact inverse. So whatever the bug is, it is quite symmetric
 Astrobytes: That's encouraging.
 struct: Should I make the pieces move always the same speed
 MSmits: I suppose so
 MSmits: good question struct
 struct: for example if it moves 1 squre it will move slowly, if it moves 10 it moves fast
 MSmits: choice between same speed or same move time
 MSmits: same move time gets annoying for small jumps
 MSmits: it would be moving really slowly
 Astrobytes: Yeah, some scaling would work for sure.
 struct: ok so same time should be better
 MSmits: no i meant that migth not be better
 jacek: isnt it the same?
 struct: oh right
 MSmits: small jumps would mean it moves really slow with same time
 struct: currently its same time
 struct: ok so based on distance
 jacek: the same speed per square
 struct: 1 square should take N milliseconds
 MSmits: distance per square
 MSmits: square per speed?
 MSmits: my physics is malfunctioning
 MSmits: help!
 Astrobytes: Scale the move speed with the distance
 MSmits: thats it
 MSmits: sometimes you just need a biologer for the simple physics
 struct: should be simple enough
 Astrobytes: MSmits: :rofl:
 MSmits: if you need me to point out a tiger, let me know Astrobytes
 <b>**Astrobytes goes back to supersymmetry</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: hahaha
 jacek: oh Caturday is over
 MSmits: not for Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: it's really weird you and I are in the same timezone jacek
 MSmits: we should be 2 hrs apart
 jacek: hm?
 struct: Is UK time always the same as portugal?
 MSmits: the distance
 MSmits: it's greater than 1/24 of the diameter of the Earth
 MSmits: circumference
 MSmits: srty
 struct: It seems it is
 Astrobytes: Yeah struct, UK, Portugal and Spain
 MSmits: well that makes sense
 struct: Not spain
 struct: Spain is +1 hour
 MSmits: like France
 Astrobytes: Yeah my bad
 MSmits: we had this discussion about daylight savings, which is called "summer time"and "winter time" here
 MSmits: for some reason people thought it would always be summer if we stopped switch
 MSmits: switching
 MSmits: that was literally the argument
 MSmits: "i like the summer, lets do that"
 struct: its gonna stop switching here
 struct: Or is it worldwide?
 Astrobytes: wtf. Here in Scotland we have the issue that it will be dark.
 Astrobytes: At the wrong time.
 MSmits: good you added that last bit
 MSmits: otherwise i would suggest the north pole
 MSmits: and south pole, depending on the season&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I'm not sure what the Brexiters signed up to in the agreement tbh
 Astrobytes: My ex worked in Antarctica for a season. I have a penguin feather :P
 MSmits: if they changed it here, it would be dark till 10 am or something
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: Yeah, 9am or thereabouts here.
 MSmits: iI read this as penguin father
 MSmits: at first
 MSmits: i was like... whoa confession
 Astrobytes: (Adélie penguin)
 Astrobytes: And lmao
 Astrobytes: "Penguin father" is amazing.
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i love penguins
 MSmits: I remember when i was young thats kind of the only animal i was interested in seeing in the zoo
 MSmits: they had these little ones
 MSmits: i dunno what it is about them, they're just cool
 Astrobytes: They are amazing. Incredible birds.
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: They are birds?
 MSmits: I dont even think of them as birds
 MSmits: but i suppose so
 Astrobytes: Yes they are.
 Astrobytes: Flightless and water-loveing
 Astrobytes: *loving
 Astrobytes: well, aquatic
 Angecide: it feels like I have reached my limit with traditional mcts solver on uttt and I wanna maybe try look into training an evaluation NN to replace my simulator and I was wondering if anyone could recommend a good paper training an eval nn?
 Astrobytes: I like Emperors and Rockhoppers
 MSmits: Angecide i dont think uttt is the best place to start learning that
 Astrobytes: ^
 Angecide: hmm
 MSmits: try oware instead
 MSmits: many have had succes 
 MSmits: uttt is notoriously hard 
 Angecide: I see, do u know a good paper on top of your head that you would recommend?
 MSmits: not a paper no
 MSmits: but if you find a good resource, please share with me 
 MSmits: there's tons of videos, little demos and assignments to find
 Angecide: I can try, I will start researching tomorrow, see if I can figure something out
 Angecide: or I guess it is today
 MSmits: you'll have to piece stuff together from various sources
 Angecide: ye I can imagine
 MSmits: people often start with basic tic tac toe, or something simpler
 MSmits: like a XOR operation
 Angecide: ye I know the gist of ML
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: i also think there are many valid ways to do it on CG
 MSmits: and the best way probably hasnt been found
 Angecide: I was thinking maybe training a model to emulate mcts, I believe that is what muzero is about if I understood it correctly
 MSmits: you can use tensorflow too
 Astrobytes: Talk to re Curse, robo, inory y (where is he anyway?), jacek... there are a lot of people who can give you some guidance on specific issues
 MSmits: mmh it doesnt emulate mcts i think?
 MSmits: it uses a similar treesearch
 Astrobytes: For CG I think it's a0 you want to be investigating based on my limited knowledge
 MSmits: and then uses a policy for choosing an action and a value from a state evaluation
 Angecide: I think more in the sense of predicting the best move like what an mcts would predict to be the best move, maybe the algo I was thinking about wasn't muzero
 MSmits: yes muzero is basically a0 except it figures out the game rules along with the best way to play the game
 MSmits: if i remember correctly
 MSmits: so it doesnt know the sim at all
 Astrobytes: Yeah something along those lines MSmits (re policy/value)
 MSmits: it just makes illegal moves and learns the rules from that
 Astrobytes: WAs that conversation from yesterday or day before? (Pretend it's Friday)
 struct: hmm, high distance seems slow, short distance seems fast 
 MSmits: not sure Astrobytes
 MSmits: struct use a power
 MSmits: make it nonlinear
 Astrobytes: ^^^^^^
 struct: So the reverse of power right?
 MSmits: between 0 and 1
 MSmits: i am guessing
 struct: oh ok
 MSmits: so, like a squareroot
 MSmits: at 0,5
 struct: The reverse :D
 MSmits: but try what works best
 MSmits: it's still a power, but if it helps to think of it as a reverse, sure :p
 Astrobytes: Angecide: mu/alpha zero conversation here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2021-01-21">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2021-01-21</a>
 Angecide: btw, assuming I have trained a NN, how does people even port the weights back to CG? Is there some clever serialization hacks for it?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: just pack it as small as possible and unpack in the first 1s
 MSmits: no need to go too far with that though
 Angecide: I see, perhaps it isn't too difficult once I get there
 MSmits: baby steps
 Astrobytes: Plenty people here that will help you with specific questions.
 struct: Square root seems to look good
 MSmits: nice
 struct: thanks
 MSmits: np
 Astrobytes: Have you fixed the colour-scheme yet struct?
 Angecide: yea I really like this community of bot competition, I get that u can't reveal all the secrets becasue of competetive edge and such, but just learning small bits and improving is very cool
 VizGhar: I plan to start with NNs later this year. I'll need you guys&#160;:) any recommendations for neither dumb nor wise guy where to start?
 MSmits: Angecide depending on who you ask, some people reveal too much :P
 VizGhar: MIT lectures seems nice

 struct: its not final
 struct: I dont know what to do for colors
 MSmits: much better than it was
 Astrobytes: That's way better struct
 MSmits: I always doubt the colors too
 struct: I need to change the yellow highlight to something else
 struct: The red is where wall will be placed
 struct: the current yellow is from and to 
 struct: where move was
 MSmits: a different shade of yellow?
 Astrobytes: A tint or something on the aquares?
 Astrobytes: *squares
 Astrobytes: Or a border?
 struct: I currently have something over the square
 struct: Might not be visible for colorblind people
 Astrobytes: I can see the highlighted squares
 Astrobytes: I mean rather than a colour change as such, change the hue or tint or whatever on the colour of the appropriate squares.
 Astrobytes: Transparency even
 Salted: Has anyone ever played with aws deep racer?
 Astrobytes: No. He cheated and I ran away.
 Astrobytes: Seriously though, I have never heard of that.
 struct: Cant change the tint of rectangles&#160;:(
 struct: only sprites
 Astrobytes: Consult re Curse
 struct: I can change the color though, currently i just put something over it
 struct: Like a yellow rectangle
 Salted: Ha! I just learned its a 1/18th scale rc car that amazon hosts for machine learning racing. 
 Astrobytes: You cannot even change the transparency?
 struct: I can
 struct: I can put a yellow over and change the transparency
 Astrobytes: That may work then struct.
 Astrobytes: Fairly high transparency
 struct: Of the highlight?
 struct: or the square itself
 Astrobytes: The highlight. You may need to adjust depending on square colour
 Astrobytes: (I'm just theorising here, I'm not acquainted enough with the SDK yet)
 struct: So I should make it more transparent?
 Astrobytes: Yes, for a start at least.
 Astrobytes: Salted: I'd never even seen this before 
 Astrobytes: Looks interesting
 Salted: I learned about it in an aws class. 
 struct: I guess I also will need to change color too, since the yellow will hide well
 Astrobytes: Yes struct, that's why I said adjust based on square colour
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Sorry, I should have been a little more concise.

 Astrobytes: And you get a cool personalised stamp for letters you send from Antarctica too
 MSmits: oh, nice
 MSmits: do they have e-mail servers on antarctica, i want a personalized stamp for my mails
 MSmits: mmh i can just put a penguin in them i suppose
 MSmits: at work, we without warning got the ability to use profile pics in our mails
 MSmits: so most used a real pic
 MSmits: and then one physics colleague used buzz lightyear
 MSmits: noone said anything about it
 MSmits: so i went with woody
 MSmits: but i forgot I often have meetings with the boss :P
 MSmits: and it showed on my ms teams thingy
 MSmits: so now he probably thinks i have a toy story obsession
 Astrobytes: hahahha
 Astrobytes: They do have a limited internet connection in Antarctica yeah
 Astrobytes: But it's reserved for family/urgent communication. Everything else is snail mail.
 MSmits: hmm what about that cat that refuses to be petted on YT?
 MSmits: that's urgent
 MSmits: mmh I will remember to download all my Norm on Conan episodes next time i go to Antarctica
 Astrobytes: Well, at least in the French station they have a lot of parties. Much eating and much drinking.
 MSmits: yeah that's a French thing

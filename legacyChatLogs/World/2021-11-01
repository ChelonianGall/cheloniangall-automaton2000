 JHBonarius: I found a nice dug in my code.Appearently using a backslash in comments is not a comment... but means the comment is continued on the next line
 JHBonarius: You can "fool" intellisense by typing a whitespace after the backslash
 JHBonarius: note: backslash at the end of the line, I mean
 JHBonarius: in my case the next line was changing a variable's value. Thus computation continued with the old value.. bug
 jacek: oh my

 NotGoodatall: what is a compiler
 NotGoodatall: in C#
 TheAvengingTurtle: :thinking:
 NotGoodatall: is this it A compiler is a program that transforms source code written in one programming language into another programming language. ... When you run the C# compiler, it takes your code as an input, does some processing, and then outputs your program in intermediate language (IL) code which is saved in *.exe or *. dll files.

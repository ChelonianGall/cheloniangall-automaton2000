 Darleanow: you're too good sir, sadly i'm not seeing you quite often in here
 Husoski: Im usually clashing or working on a puzzle.
 Husoski: Right now, I was just on the language version page to compare with what's on CodeWars and saw your question.
 Husoski: I'm disappearing now to get in a little guitar practice before bed.  Good night!
 Darleanow: Okay sir&#160;!! gn&#160;:)

 Koushikrr: cool
 Fady.Z: yeah i did it too technical assesement 
 Fady.Z: but it is not same as the exercises
 EtnoPolino: i find it hard to do for a job interview
 Fady.Z: i did a sql test, i am gd at sql i found mid level not too hard
 Fady.Z: but if someone don't have a gd skill i guess yes he will find it not easy
 Fady.Z: it is not the same as the practice, it was a general question about queries and results

 derjack: but can he?
 Astrobytes: I would presume not.
 Deimox: Heyo :slight_smile:
 MSmits: Today I learned what a secateur is
 Astrobytes: *what secateurs are
 nicola: Scissors to cut plants.
 MSmits: indeed, if you know 1, you know them all
 nicola: In French.
 MSmits: how do you cut a plant in French?
 MSmits: Special technique?
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: We use the same term in English nicola
 Deimox: With baguette&#160;?
 nicola: OK, I did not know that.
 nicola: Not secator?
 Astrobytes: Yet another word the English 'borrowed'
 Astrobytes: I think secator is the American English spelling
 MSmits: Do you know what it's called when you cut your plants but the result doesn't make sense?
 Astrobytes: God forbid they would spell it the same as the rest of the world
 MSmits: It's a non-secateur

 MSmits: you should just practice easy puzzles then
 MSmits: use an easy language
 Mred: ok
 Mred: thanks a lot
 MSmits: np
 derjack: easy puzzles like the descent, temperatures, power of thor or dual horse racing
 MSmits: if an easy puzzle is too hard, try a different one. Some require math skills or some kind of specific knowledge and you can get stuck on those
 Astrobytes: or learn something
 MSmits: sure, but if you can barely code at all, you don't want to have to deal with more than that
 Astrobytes: true

 5DN1L: What if all robots other than the one at position 20 faces right, and the robot at position 20 faces left?
 pols71634873: is there a vim mode here
 pols71634873: ah yes
 TINOUAINANI: that is thi big problem hi didnet say how i face the robots 
 5DN1L: you can do whatever you want
 5DN1L: you just have to calculate the longest time
 5DN1L: you aren't restricted on the facing directions
 5DN1L: "assume Bob is free to arrange every bot to face it either Left or Right before starting the show"
 5DN1L: The statement has already told you so
 TINOUAINANI: for example if i face all robots to lift the first test will be faulse 
 5DN1L: what do you mean?
 TINOUAINANI:     &gt;       &lt;+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  init state0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 TINOUAINANI: try all to the lift
 TINOUAINANI: like this
 TINOUAINANI:    &lt;       &lt;+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  init state0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 5DN1L: why
 TINOUAINANI: becouse you say any directions
 5DN1L: yes, but you have to calculate the maximum possible
 TINOUAINANI: What&#160;??? do you mean i test all posibeltis&#160;??
 5DN1L: Nope, there's a trick
 TINOUAINANI: what is it&#160;?
 5DN1L: the tag of the puzzle says "Strive for Simplicity"
 TINOUAINANI: mmmmm so i think complex
 5DN1L: try thinking about how to calculate the answer if there is just one bot
 5DN1L: then think about whether collisions make any difference to the answer
 TINOUAINANI: easy they make big difference
 Astrobytes: Don't overcomplicate it. This puzzle is far, far, far easier than it first looks.
 TINOUAINANI: i dont undestand if what i do faulse whay i have all correcte exapte test2
 5DN1L: your simulation may be correct, but it isn't the simulation that gives the maximum answer
 TINOUAINANI: i just whatch them fight antill last one exit thats it
 Big_Code: The guy who made the top answer for unary must be a wizard :joy: Such a simple solution..
 5DN1L: overcomplicating stuff may be a common problem of beginners :wink:
 5DN1L: but it's still good practice
 5DN1L: right? Big_Code
 Astrobytes: true enough&#160;:)
 TINOUAINANI: i will retry untill i get it , thanks guys
 Big_Code: :innocent: I've been told that in the past lol, Adding too many things that I think are useful, but aren't actually needed 
 5DN1L: but it's ok to learn more than you need&#160;:) that "something more" may be required in other problems
 5DN1L: you never know
 Big_Code: Good point!

 Wontonimo: how's your coding going TINOUAINANI&#160;?
 Wontonimo: did you get a simulation going?
 Wontonimo: or think about the collisions?
 Baskarapandi: hi
 OrdoAdChao: hi
 Baskarapandi: where are you from?
 OrdoAdChao: Canada
 Baskarapandi: great
 Wontonimo: white north
 OrdoAdChao: trying these bot games, they are a lot more fun than I expected
 Wontonimo: cool.  which one are you trying now?
 OrdoAdChao: Code4Life now, started with pod racing
 OrdoAdChao: some other ones looked fun or were fun, like the dice one, but its dissapointing when they don't have several leagues. I enjoy seeing the rules evolve
 eulerscheZahl: contest just started<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/9bb1c5e1-dbb3-4407-be0e-3cc0dc45bf1a">https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/9bb1c5e1-dbb3-4407-be0e-3cc0dc45bf1a</a>
 Wontonimo: what league did you get to in pod racing?
 OrdoAdChao: Gold, i took a break instead of adapting my code to two pods
 OrdoAdChao: my Bronze submission seemed to pass Silver without any edits. while I was busy putting in shield functions it passed me through x)
 Wontonimo: very nice.  Did you use PID controllers or some other method?
 OrdoAdChao: i don't know what a pid controller is. bookmarked an explanation for later
 Wontonimo: here is the best article that explains it that i've found <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf">https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf</a>
 OrdoAdChao: thanks
 Wontonimo: that's even more impressive that you got to Gold without PID 
 Wontonimo: did you do simulation or was it mostly hard-coded heuristic logic?
 Wontonimo: (heuristic is if/else statements that embody your way of solving the problem)
 OrdoAdChao: one section to collect data, then some if statements
 Wontonimo: cool.  After code4life, if you are looking for more heuristic multis check out Spring Challenge 2021 &amp; 2022, Code Royal, Botters of the Galaxy, and Space Shooter
 Wontonimo: in all those multis you can get pretty far with if statements and studying the game.
 OrdoAdChao: Thanks Wontonimo, took note.
 SriniV: taco
 Razovsky: @Wontonimo do you know how i can evolve from doing if/else codes (heuristic it seems to be) to more autonomous (IA-like) codes&#160;? Would like to learn it, but im kinda stucked on simple solutions each time
 Wontonimo: yeah, i have some ideas for you
 Razovsky: hello eulerscheZahl , is this contest just for fun&#160;?
 Razovsky: Wontonimo cool&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: fun and TCO points
 eulerscheZahl: collect points from april 1st till june 30th and win a tshirt or a trip to the finals
 Wontonimo: To do AI like code, you'll need a way for your program to play against itself 
 Wontonimo: this is generally called simulation Razovsky
 Razovsky: eulerscheZahl oh okay, not interested, im not a pro , no time to move ^^ but the problem is fun 
 Wontonimo: one fairly straight forward game to try and simulate is tic-tac-toe.  Would you be able to code the rules for tic-tac-toe&#160;?
 Razovsky: Wontonimo i guess i cant do it with if/else statements&#160;? ^^
 Wontonimo: yeah, you could code tic-tac-toe with if/else and a few loops
 Wontonimo: and an few arrays
 Wontonimo: are you familiar with 1D and 2D arrays?
 Razovsky: yeah i can do that
 Razovsky: did a lot of puzzles here in C++, forgot the language mostly in 3 year absence, but i'm quite okay with python now
 Wontonimo: cool.  So, if you code up the rules for something like TTT, you can make your program play itself
 Wontonimo: here is the tictactoe puzzle to get started <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/tictactoe">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/tictactoe</a>
 Wontonimo: and a coding train video <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTWrWM1UsnA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTWrWM1UsnA</a>
 Razovsky: Java erk
 Wontonimo: once you can code in the rules of a game (the simulation) then we can talk about adding AI
 Razovsky: (im joking)
 Razovsky: okay, ill do that
 Wontonimo: which effectively just searches over multiple games 
 jacek: :taco: derjack
 antiwonto: [auto] Spread the love.  Give tacos to someone else, not someone you spam with tacos.
 Wontonimo: some possible searches you can try are&#160;: minimax , beam , MC , MCTS , GA
 Wontonimo: I'd recommend MC to start with as it is dead simple
 Razovsky: gonna write this dwn asap
 Razovsky: thx a lot
 Razovsky: ill code the game and bother you again after
 Wontonimo: So, to summarize:  One way to make a game AI is to simulate the game in code, and then use the simulation to search for a good move (by using minimax, beam, MCTS, etc)
 Wontonimo: some of those searches need you to make an evaluation function and some do not.  An evaluation function is something your code that scores the board, in checkers that could be piece count - opponent piece count.
 Razovsky: okay&#160;! so each turn, i simulate several continuations of the game  starting from the status of the game, i evaluate the best move, and i play it 
 Wontonimo: I suggest MC (Monte Carlo) as your first search because it does not need an evaluation function and it is simple to code.
 Wontonimo: yes, that's pretty much it Razovsky
 Razovsky: hence the game rules are just a function in this code&#160;? Seems good, for complex games.
 Razovsky: but how to limitate the simulation&#160;?
 Razovsky: i mean, it can timeout in this platform, thats the trick
 SamuelLouise: any instructions over how to use structures on here?
 Scarfield: lol spread the love antiwonto
 Wontonimo: haha :D
 SamuelLouise: for c would be great
 Razovsky: (by the way thanks for the PID document, ive to learn this too)
 Wontonimo: very good question Razovsky regarding timeout.  You'll want your simulation to be effecient and run fast so you can do a lot of them.  You will limit the number of simulations you run by keeping track of time and halting before you run out of it
 Razovsky: as im not good in code optimization, but this will come later, when im able to do AI codes&#160;;)
 Razovsky: thanks a lot&#160;!
 Wontonimo: One of the benefits of MC is that it is an any-time algorithm and you can stop it whenever.  The longer it runs, the better answer you will get but you can get an answer from it anytitme.
 Razovsky: am very excited to try this, i wanted to before quitting codiingame, but now that im back its a new objective
 Razovsky: will be fun
 Razovsky: thanks again
 Scarfield: when i started with AI here on CG, i new very little python. made a MCTS for UTTT that had 200 sims per turn xD
 SamuelLouise: why am i getting aired....
 Wontonimo: are you up for looking at C++ again?  I have a tic tac toe example that shows simulation, MC, and code optimization for tic tac toe
 Scarfield: it was terrible(!!!) performance, but i learned a lot about MCTS, and then got motivated to learn about performance  
 Scarfield: new =knew
 Wontonimo: hey, i did the same thing Scarfield!
 Wontonimo: python is horrible for AI search
 Scarfield: for sure, and i was told several times when asking about MCTS to not do it in python. But that was what i knew then, and the motivation to learn C++ only came after knowing i understood MCTS, and my python version sucked xD
 putibuzu: some things have to be learned the hard way :D 
 jacek: SamuelLouise you mean struct?
 Scarfield: :taco: jacek
 antiwonto: [auto] Scarfield has awarded jacek 10 tacos. jacek now has 31 taco. Scarfield now has 30 taco
 SamuelLouise: jacek yes
 Razovsky: Wontonimo i heard about python being good only for simple things, hence i'll go back to C++, ive to study it a bit again
 Razovsky: an example would be great, to make faster progress, but i can learn solo too, dont worry
 Scarfield: that was kind of my point Razovsky, if you want to learn about the AI algo, you can use the language you are most confident in, afterwards go to a faster language for performance. Having to both study the language and algo might not be as rewarding&#160;:)
 jacek: SamuelLouise smoething like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_structures.htm">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_structures.htm</a>&#160;?
 Scarfield: VB.NET xD jacek
 SamuelLouise: Jacek tried using this on codingame but wasnt working... il try again
 jacek: what vb.net?
 Scarfield: your backgammon bot
 jacek: :taco: Scarfield
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Scarfield 10 tacos. Scarfield now has 40 taco. jacek now has 32 taco
 jacek: ah
 jacek: isnt it strong
 Scarfield: much power
 Scarfield: just started reading the statement for backgammon struct xD
 eulerscheZahl: when you finished, go read #de
 eulerscheZahl: great poem, world-class literature
 Scarfield: sigh
 struct: I didnt have time yet to write it
 struct: ...
 Scarfield: started learning german on duolingo, found out Eule means owl 
 eulerscheZahl: that's correct
 struct: and I need to fix the viewer
 struct: still dont know how I will fit so much missing stuff
 struct: on the space I have
 struct: I need to add player messages, pip score
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/Be2A2E5">https://imgur.com/a/Be2A2E5</a>
 struct: Someone already managed to draw a game...
 Scarfield: "Your actions have an effect." and other great phrases&#160;:)
 struct: so pip score will be needed Scarfield
 eulerscheZahl: that's the default template
 struct: whats the score of a piece on the bar Scarfield?
 eulerscheZahl: the aim of the game is to win
 eulerscheZahl: i can quote that without looking it up
 Scarfield: oh, thought that was struct being funny 
 eulerscheZahl: that's jupoulton being funny
 Scarfield: hmm, good question struct, i guess 25, since its one space away from 24
 struct: how did someone managed to draw with 300 outputs...
 struct: so its minimum 600 moves
 struct: oh not really 600 because sometimes you can play only 1
 Westicles: google human-level AI!
 Westicles: run for the hills
 nicola: Run for your life.
 Scarfield: pip count on bar should be 25 (tested in a very popular backgammon software)
 struct: thanks
 jacek: very popular backgammon software?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: new LOCM, green on pink...can't read the damn thing
 Scarfield: since you gave me tacos; xgammon or extremegammon
 eulerscheZahl: i agree PatrickMcGinnisII. i take that as a physical assault
 jacek: so popular i never heard of it
 Scarfield: but have you hear about the bird?
 Scarfield: heard *
 jacek: the word?
 eulerscheZahl: head*
 eulerscheZahl: bird is a word? now i see Peter Griffin singing that
 Scarfield: b-b-b-b-bird

 eulerscheZahl: at least you tried
 Scarfield: same for me
 struct: I know xgammon because its where I saw opening books
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
 Scarfield: i like that link has xqc as the last 3 chars
 eulerscheZahl: but not in that order
 Scarfield: its a shame
 pluieciel: Hi, anyone knows how to use clojure.core.matrix here, if I need the linalg functions? Thanke
 pluieciel: (:require [clojure.core.matrix :as mx]) doesn't work. and I am not familiar with library/package/module things..
 jacek: is this some standard library?
 Scarfield: looking at the faq (which is weird atm) it seems there are no libraries for clojure <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/c856Hhk">https://imgur.com/a/c856Hhk</a>
 pluieciel: ok i understand, thanks
 pluieciel: i'll try python then:grin:
 jacek: oO
 RandomStuffDev: Why
 RandomStuffDev: What are you trying to do
 RandomStuffDev: if it is game development I would say to choose C#
 XJDream: haloooo
 OrdoAdChao: :wave:
 XJDream: i'm new here
 OrdoAdChao: I joined last week, welcome to the site
 XJDream: thanks! I found it very interesting

 MAWAAW: lets go
 jacek: oO
 MAWAAW: jacek where were you between 18 and 20pm
 MAWAAW: :D
 MSmits: He was in the village!
 jacek: you have nice background image
 MSmits: You mean it's the same color as the chat?
 MSmits: like yours
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Manchi_o6o7: Hey guys. Has anyone some tips on the most efficient way to find the longest walk between two nodes in a acyclic diagraph
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Manchi_o6o7, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 12 tacos
 MSmits: :taco: antiwonto
 antiwonto: [auto] That's a bot.  Bots don't eat tacos
 jacek: how about BFS/dijkstra for shortest, but the path weights would be negative?
 Manchi_o6o7: The graph is unweighted
 Manchi_o6o7: by walk I mean the longest distance between that two nodes
 Mohamed_Zkaria: Is there a way to download the text of any of the clash of codes problems? 
 Manchi_o6o7: a-b-c-d-e-f would be the length of 6
 Manchi_o6o7: sorry, 5
 Manchi_o6o7: there are 5 edges

 ImSeaFu: Dangit, I forget what I was supposed to be doing with the machine learning xD
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey ImSeaFu, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 16 tacos
 ImSeaFu: Someone had recommended something to me and I forget what it was
 Wontonimo: hey ImSeaFu
 Wontonimo: do you remember the context or topic or problem?
 ImSeaFu: figured it out, it was the neural network from scratch book/videos
 Espequair: Just had the worst CoC ever
 Espequair: reverse mode
 Espequair: examples aren't really helpful
 Wontonimo: 7x+3 = 2x-88
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Wontonimo, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 25 tacos
 Wontonimo: 7x+3 = 2x-88
 ImSeaFu: lol
 Wontonimo: solve 7x+3 = 2x-88
 ImSeaFu: he's rebelling xD
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 Wontonimo: yeah he is
 Wontonimo: 7*x+3 = 2*x-88
 antiwonto: [auto] x = -18.199999999816164
 Wontonimo: there we go
 PatrickMcGinnisII: solve 7^x=49
 PatrickMcGinnisII: solve 7**x=49
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I rebel too
 Husoski: 7x + 2 = 7x + 3
 Wontonimo: you need a * between 7 and x
 Wontonimo: 7^x = 49
 antiwonto: [auto] x = 2
 Husoski: 7*x + 2 = 2*x + 3
 antiwonto: [auto] x = end of the universe
 Husoski: 7*x  = 2*x - 3
 antiwonto: [auto] x = -0.6000000000025484
 Husoski: 7*x  = 7*x - 3
 antiwonto: [auto] x = end of the universe
 Wontonimo: 1/x = x
 Husoski: I was expecting "beginning of the universe" for minus infinity.
 antiwonto: [auto] x = 1
 Husoski: what happened to x = -1?
 Wontonimo: i tried to get it to solve multiple answers but ... i failed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tacos are always positive
 Husoski: heh.  Nice job anyway.
 Wontonimo: it just finds one then is just so proud of itself
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :taco: Husoski
 antiwonto: [auto] PatrickMcGinnisII has awarded Husoski 10 tacos. Husoski now has 21 taco. PatrickMcGinnisII now has 30 taco
 Husoski: Thanks Patrick
 PatrickMcGinnisII: antiwonto Di you taco_max me?
 Husoski: ...and you too, McGinnisII
 Husoski: x*x = x + 1
 antiwonto: [auto] x = end of the universe
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 0
 Husoski: oops, the golden ratio just went away
 Husoski: x = 1 + 1/x
 antiwonto: [auto] x = -0.6180339887396737
 Husoski: It's back, but in extraneous solution form!
 Wontonimo: it has a hard time with negative numbers it seems
 Wontonimo: x*x = x + 1
 antiwonto: [auto] x = end of the universe
 Wontonimo:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: x*x-x = 1
 antiwonto: [auto] x = end of the universe
 Wontonimo: x-1=1/x
 antiwonto: [auto] x = -0.6180339887471816
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Wontonimo: antiwonto you have failed me for the last time
 struct: x-2 = 1/x
 antiwonto: [auto] x = -0.4142135623720634
 struct: isnt it right Wontonimo?
 Mai-Hoang-Dang: hello vietnam
 Mai-Hoang-Dang:&#160;:)))
 Wontonimo: yeah, it's right struct but it couldn't figure out the x*x = x+1
 waterproofsodium: kill me I had to work with java
 waterproofsodium: 5 hours - nothing learned - no progress
 NinjaZMY: @blueArtemis is a genius 
 waterproofsodium: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 waterproofsodium: there's a strong correlation on whether you're a genius to whether you're not using java
 Wontonimo: Einstein didn't use java.  Coincidence? 
 NinjaZMY: I hate java but I love js 
 waterproofsodium: well they have nothing in common lol
 Wontonimo: first 4 letters
 Wontonimo: they were both intended to be run on the web

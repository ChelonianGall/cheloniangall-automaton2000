 King007: Hi
 Thorcode: hi
 Thorcode: play some private clash?
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/20026946414a0bb766ee179f2da3b5a27133d9b">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/20026946414a0bb766ee179f2da3b5a27133d9b</a>
 Thorcode:&#160;:( bored
 DonFruendo: the clash has been cancelled
 FBF_Luis: I'd be up for a clash&#160;:)
 a3: asilas
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: I cancelled cuz no one join&#160;:(
 FBF_Luis: anyone knows which version of c++ this site is using?
 Thorcode: no
 FBF_Luis: hum... I getting an error when using ":" in a for loop
 Thorcode: I use python :grin:
 TheBlueBias:&#160;: works
 FBF_Luis: I prefer python aswell, but work exists
 FBF_Luis: I know ":" should work, must be something else then&#160;:/
 TheBlueBias: Well since you asked for the C++ version I wanted to confirm that you can use it on the site.
 TheBlueBias: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions</a>
 FBF_Luis: yes, thanks&#160;:)
 FBF_Luis: I think the problem is that I want to loop through a queue but the queue is not well initialized
 FBF_Luis: and I have no idea why xD
 FBF_Luis: I deleted the code, wrote it again and the error dissapeared. Great
 TheBlueBias: Are you sure? You shouldn't be able to itterate over a std::queue...
 FBF_Luis: well, I have no red line now
 TheBlueBias: Yeah, but did you ran the code?
 FBF_Luis: not yet
 FBF_Luis: oh, the line is back
 TheBlueBias: ^^
 FBF_Luis: :sob:
 StaySafe:&#160;;(
 ProCoder03: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 TheBlueBias: You don't want to itterate over a queue. Or you don't want a queue.
 FBF_Luis: if I want to print the elements, do I have to pop them?
 ProCoder03: yup
 ProCoder03: you have to pop them till the queue length is zero
 ProCoder03: that need loop
 FBF_Luis: ok, then I can't print it for debug
 FBF_Luis: unless I save a copy somewhere
 ProCoder03: yup... 
 TheBlueBias: Or you can use a deque instead.
 FBF_Luis: that is probably a good idea, but I want to practice queues ^^
 ProCoder03: wait shit, my bad... , queues has dequeue only, pop is for stacks 
 ProCoder03: :sweat_smile:
 TheBlueBias: So just copy it before printing.
 FBF_Luis: queues also have pop according to c++ documentation
 TheBlueBias: Yup
 TheBlueBias: Btw queue use an underlying container that can be a deque. So you could create a deque, use it with queue in your code, but iterate directly over the deque when you want to print it.
 FBF_Luis: you mean using a deque but only use functions of queue? (except the iteration)
 TheBlueBias: You can do that.But in fact I'm not sure of what I said before... :thinking:
 TheBlueBias: Yeah. No standard way to do that. My bad.
 FBF_Luis: oh man, had to restart my pc and my code is gone
 FBF_Luis: fml
 TheBlueBias: The code is saved only when tou run it.
 FBF_Luis: I can confirm I had not run it
 TheBlueBias:&#160;:/
 Husoski: FWIW, a (proper) deque doesn't let you read the contents without emptying it any more than a queue does.  
 TheBlueBias: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/deque">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/deque</a>
 TheBlueBias: Meant std::deque not theorical deque.
 Husoski: Yeah, but that's C++'s idea of a deque.  Python's collections.deque also has extras.
 Husoski: Like I said, FWIW...doesn't guarantee being worth anything...&#160;:)
 Husoski: Anyway, I do the same thing as you  in C++, use a std::deque directly instead of wrapping with std::queue.  I'll put up with push_back instead of push as a small price to pay for being able to get debug output.
 TheBlueBias: Didn't know the acronym. ^^Another way to do is to inherit priority_queue to get access to its underlying container which is protected. So you can have your queue class with an extra "print" method for instance.
 Husoski: I should have read farther back.  I didn't see that the queue was a priority queue.  
 TheBlueBias: *queue
 TheBlueBias: Sorry ^^'

 Vintarel: oO indeed it's not written, i could never have guessed alone. Thanks for the answer though
 darkhorse64: I made a post on the forum to explain this rule. Sorry for missing that in the review. 
 Shrimpster: so... in a MCTS, if Im playing against an opponent, do I need to switch the average value in the UCB to (1-average) so that my opponent takes the best move for him?
 darkhorse64: No, you should rather store the result from the point of view of the player: my loss/ your win. If you score 0, I score 1
 darkhorse64: This way the UCB formula is not dependant of the player
 Shrimpster: and reverse the result as I return it up the tree?
 darkhorse64: yes
 darkhorse64: A very common error is to back propagate the wrong value. If it's your first MCTS, it's likely it will happen. Everyone has done it wrong the first time:sweat_smile:
 Shrimpster: theoretically those should give the same result right? Switching the result and the UCB I mean
 darkhorse64: yes
 Shrimpster: Yeah its my first how did you guess xD I did it wring at start and then just switched the UCB (instead of the result), I don't see the error. Is it incorrect?
 darkhorse64: no, just inefficient. I advised to use -1/0/1 for L/D/W. This way, when you backprop, you just have to reverse the sign
 darkhorse64: s/advised/advise/
 Shrimpster: Ahh okay thanks ^.^  will do
 alhiane: hello
 darkhorse64: :raised_hand:
 alhiane: how are you doimg bro
 Uljahn: great, we are practicing coding here, you?
 alhiane: yeah 
 Drag0nEye: :pray:
 derjack: code? here!?
 alhiane: Shadows of the Knight - Episode 1
 Uljahn: use binary search there, one dimensional case is easy but you should extend it to 2D
 derjack: Shrimpster if changing value to -1/0/1 dont forget to adjust exploration constant
 eefunn.uwu: ayo i dunno anything about coding lmfao
 Snovud: hello Yarik
 FBF_Luis: so, what should I do when I pass all the tests except one where the game has 1262 rounds and the problem is somewhere around round 250?
 Uljahn: hope for telepaths to decrypt your message
 miszu: I guess for GA chosing a random angle between 0 to 359 is too much
 miszu: can't figure out the base case even
 Uljahn: use predefined angles, like 0, 18, 36 etc
 miszu: yeah this is where I am going towards
 Uljahn: it's called discretization
 miszu: I am sad that you need to use discretization
 miszu: I thought that he will be able to figure something out
 Uljahn: it's not a requirement though, just some optimization technique
 miszu: but when you do crossover, I guess averaging them should be fine
 miszu: is it truely optimization?
 miszu: or more a hack?
 Uljahn: yeah, you trade precision for speed
 Uljahn: it's better to find a suboptimal solution than nothing
 miszu: and I guess same thing for distance
 miszu: instead from 0 to 1000 use discretization
 Uljahn: sure thing
 miszu: I truely believe GA &gt; MC
 Uljahn: also there is SA
 miszu: SA = Silent Assassin?
 Uljahn: simulated annealing
 miszu: too much hitman I played :P
 miszu: is it good?
 Uljahn: i mean the underlying concept of lowering a temperature (or e.g. a mutation rate) is not very hard to understand but it could enrich your mindset i guess
 miszu: no fore sure

 19WEBBER: hi
 miszu: Uljahn for crossover for two floats you would simply do an average?
 Uljahn: it depends
 Uljahn: there is a substitution strategy where you take either one or the other
 miszu: so if I have two floats you take one from each different parent
 Uljahn: i don't know what are those floats
 miszu: angle and distance sorry
 Uljahn: averaging could be a good idea, you need to test both
 miszu: yeah gonna do that
 miszu: start simple

 Kairu111: I need to count the sum of all digits of a number until there is one character left. 192 = 1 + 9 + 2 = 12 = 1 + 2 = 3.(n-1)% 9 + 1 does it successfully, but how and why? Can anyone explain?
 jzen: What language are you using? And what have you tried so far?
 Kairu111: Python
 jzen: Oh I missed the last part, my bad
 jzen: Have you tried going through and proving it on paper?
 Kairu111: This method works for sure, but I don’t even come close to understanding why.
 miszu: my GA does super well for combos but when he can only make one good move which is going straight line to the other end of the map, he fails to see that
 Uljahn: that's why MC with heuristics is a viable choice
 derjack: so use GA when there are many good choices and nonGA if there is one. [solved] :x
 miszu: flat MC
 Uljahn: guess it's not very flat when there are heuristics involved
 miszu: also it's because he starts in a corner, so the deltas go out of bounce and only output as you lost. I should give a bigger negative score if you are out of bound
 miszu: if he starts in middle of map let's say then he can figure it out
 miszu: I will show you two scenarios

 Uljahn: i like how CMA-ES guides the search, another amazing concept to learn
 Uljahn: consider adding angles directed towards humans to the genome, should be better
 Uljahn: i mean with slightly higer probability
 miszu: what  Iwill do in my eval function is if you are out of bound I give an exponential negative value
 miszu: so the earlier the move you are out of bound, the bigger the number
 miszu: so if you are in a corner, moves that go out will be out of calculations
 struct: what do you mean out of bounds?
 struct: ah
 struct: I just limit the position to
 struct: max(0, min(x, 16000))
 struct: out of bounds move is still legal I think?
 Uljahn: Constraints:0 ≤ x &lt; 160000 ≤ y &lt; 9000

 Wontonimo: there issuccessful hack = +100unsuccessful hack = -50
 eulerscheZahl: that's for puzzle contests
 eulerscheZahl: there are some, but incomplete tests during the contest when you submit
 eulerscheZahl: so you might fail the final system test
 Wontonimo: ah.  nice, like a validation set
 eulerscheZahl: but when you solved a problem, you can lock it. that gives you access to solutions from others. you can read their code and check for mistakes, corner cases that they will fail
 eulerscheZahl: so you try to "hack" it by giving an input that you think causes the other program to timeout, print a wrong result, ...
 TheBlueBias: :smiling_imp:
 eulerscheZahl: if you rightfully claimed the other program to be faulty, you get those 100 points
 Wontonimo: oh, i like that
 eulerscheZahl: the code is given to you as something like a picture. you can't just copy it and run it offline
 Saunuri: is there any way of seeing the validators for the code golf puzzles? I'm clearing the tests but getting 60% on submit

 eulerscheZahl: when you found it, open it on codingame to see the validators
 Wontonimo: resist Saunuri, resist!
 Wontonimo: which puzzle are you trying?
 eulerscheZahl: codeforces also has a concept of rooms. you can't hack everyone but just your room of about 50 users. random distribution to rooms
 eulerscheZahl: to prevent your buddy adding a bug on purpose that you can then hack
 Wontonimo: you will learn more about how to find corner cases Saunuri if you try it yourself instead of looking up the answer.  It is a very valuable skill.
 Saunuri: I am doing the temperatures one
 jacek: did you do the non code golf temperatures first
 Saunuri: Yeah I have done it with C# just wanted to see if could get a bit shorter one done with JS

 NiamNiam: Is it me or is this website puzzles / games kinda hard? I feel like you already need to have a solid understanding of a lot of things before starting&#160;:/
 fkberthold: NiamNiam, yeah, it's a common problem. This site is geared toward people who already have a solid grasp of at least one programming language.
 MiyamuraIzumi: Hello guys
 fkberthold: Greetings!
 NiamNiam: Yeah, I did notice a trend in websites introducing "let's help you land the job / help with puzzles / etc", but the barrier to entry or to enjoy it is high. 
 jacek: you need at least some basics, it isnt complete beginner's tutorial site
 fkberthold: I can't blame you for your frustration. I'll be honest, I code for a living, I use this site to relax and have a bit of fun.  So this is perfect for where I'm at.
 fkberthold: So, for you, why do you want to learn. Did you have a language in mind?
 NiamNiam: lol I didn't say I was a beginner. I am working on frontend side of things, so JS is not used that extensively, unless a certain feature needs implementing
 jacek: also depends what you do at work. frankly i almost never touch pure algorithmic stuff at work
 NiamNiam: Same here. Which is why I wanted to come here and learn at a leisurely pace.  But I am finding the puzzles UI tiresome to look at - maybe it's just something to get used to haha
 jacek: i/o of this site was the biggest stuggle for me at first
 NiamNiam: not familiar with "i/o" abbreviation
 jacek: input output
 fkberthold: Alright, so what part of the UI is giving you trouble?
 eulerscheZahl: i've always seen the UI as one of the main arguments pro CG. of course it's useless and total overkill for the onboarding. but really helps to visually debug multiplayer games
 fkberthold: And honestly makes them more fun (for me at least).
 jacek: ui is fun. maybe ui-less puzzles trouble him
 eulerscheZahl: talking about the interactive viewer here, in case you mean other parts of the UI
 NiamNiam: "Check your codeDo you think you fixed the problem? Run your code to check if it works!" &lt;- this is annoying. No way to close it either or remove it for good. 
 fkberthold: Are you on the onboarding puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: the onboarding with all the tooltips. yes, that's too much if you have a bit of knowledge or common sense
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry, only 2 games/puzzles have these
 eulerscheZahl: the rest of the website is free of them
 jacek: tutorial game like onitama doesnt have it oO
 NiamNiam: I am past onboarding, was trying things out with bots / pods
 jacek: coders strike back?
 NiamNiam: yeah
 jacek: this is another 'onboarding' game
 eulerscheZahl: the multiplayer onboarding
 eulerscheZahl: move to (x,y) instead of (y,y)then set thrust to 100and you are done with the annoying part
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not a fan of coders strike back, as the input format changes a few times between leagues. CSB is the only game that does this nonsense
 NiamNiam: I suppose I'll stick to it for a bit and see what happens  :) 
 Arridian: Just when I get back, people happen to be talking about that game again, 
 Arridian: What insight have you gained, Niam Niam?
 fkberthold: Just my opinion on this, CG pushes the competitions pretty hard (with good reason), but I'd suggest hanging out on the puzzles for a while first, especially if you want to focus on sharpening your algorithmic skills.
 Arridian: okay, 
 jacek: CG pushes to escape now :F
 NiamNiam: So far? That it has potential to be fun for me - but maybe further down the line... Also, I like to skim read a lot and that didn't help. :D
 TheBlueBias: "CG pushes the competitions pretty hard" :rofl:
 Arridian: Does anyone have any tips on how to beat boss 4 in the pod racing? Bronze league? I asked yesterday and didn't get any good answers.
 fkberthold: Yeah yeah, I know, everyone hates escape. I can only figure they're hoping to find a way to make money off the corps.
 NiamNiam: @fkberthold - fair enough! I'll stick around for a bit
 Arridian: It is the one where they turn on colliding. 
 Arridian: They kind of stopped telling me how to improve my pod, so I'm not sure how to proceed.
 jacek: Arridian target - 3 * velocity
 jacek: find the current velocity of your pod (hint: current position - last position) and substract from the next checkpoint
 Wontonimo: I'm not giving that hint away anymore
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: instead I tell people to read up about PID controllers
 Wontonimo: and maybe direct them to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf">https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf</a>
 NiamNiam: is it just me or does the animation of our code gets frozen after X attempts? 
 Wontonimo: yes, it's a known issue
 Arridian: What is a PID controller, wontomino?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf">https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf</a>
 Wontonimo: it's the same thing that cruise control and autopilot uses
 Wontonimo: it really isn't advanced code, it's fairly doable control system code with really fancy names
 Wontonimo: like jacek said, one part of it is to correct for velocity
 Wontonimo: imagine you are driving up to a red light.  Depending on your velocity as you approach the light you will press on the break with more or less force
 Arridian: Okay, I will read the pdf.
 Arridian: If I have any questions, can I ask you wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: I sent you a PM with an example of PID in action
 Wontonimo: yeah, sure
 Arridian: okay, thanks
 jacek: math :unamused: physics :unamused: who needs them

 olaf_surgut: does anyone know how to find timeouts on CG? when i measure code localy with sanitizers vs himself and random enemy it works perfectly
 olaf_surgut: reading and printing output is reliable
 DomiKo: at which game?
 olaf_surgut: clobber
 jacek: timeout could mean a crash
 olaf_surgut: sanitizers would detect it localy
 DomiKo: hmm I can use 145ms without any problems
 jacek: only thing you could do on CG is put cerr lines here and there and narrow it down
 DomiKo: it could be too much memory too

 TheBlueBias: +s
 LiquidBacon: ur mom &gt; c#
 TheBlueBias: A man came on #fr to ask for a python starter code like the SC2021 one, but without sayin' for what. And I got scolded for sayin' I can't guess for what multi he wanted it, 'cause it was obviously for the new contest: Code vs Zombies. :3
 jacek: those toxic #fr people ~
 TheBlueBias: Nyoro~n
 Arridian: Does anyone know any other easy puzzles for noobs? Other than coder strikes back?
 Arridian: For bot programming specifically.
 jacek: connect 4
 miszu: ghost in the cell
 Arridian: Okay, thanks guys.
 Arridian: Which one of the two is easier?
 Westicles: These guys think all the 8x8 and 9x7 grid games are easy since it is the same approach over and over
 Arridian: Do you disagree with that?
 jacek: easy to learn, hard to master
 Westicles: I guess it depends if you are in an mcts mood or not.
 jacek: gitc can be done in few lines of code
 Arridian: Okay, thanks.
 jacek: connect 4 is easy 'classic' board game, but top leaderboard require some knowledge of minimax and/or mcts, nn stuff
 Arridian: okay, lol
 Arridian: I have no clue what those are.
 Arridian: I just need to get bronze so I can progress with quest
 jacek: ghost in the cell it is then
 jacek: ahh, connect 4 has no bronze
 Arridian: oh, rip
 Westicles: might as well go for two silvers since you'll need it later.  FWIW, the only two I have are CSB and FC2020
 Arridian: What is FC2020?
 Westicles: fall challenge
 Arridian: Oh, okay
 Arridian: How should I get started with ghost in the cell? I have no clue what to do.
 jacek: miszu ^
 jacek: first, read the statement
 Kingooooo: How do I use the variables defined in a for loop outside the for loop?
 Schwase: define them before the loop
 Schwase: set their values inside the loop
 Schwase: what language btw?
 Schwase: if java that is what you have to do
 Kingooooo: JavaScript
 Schwase: im not sure idk JS but in java you would need to do that
 Schwase: like

 Kingooooo: thanks
 Arridian: I sent you a PM jacek
 Arridian: What is the max number of links a facotry can have in Ghost in teh shell?
 Arridian: *cell
 struct: max number of planets -1?
 struct: so would be 14
 Arridian: lol, this challenge is showing me how bad at coding I am
 Arridian: The coder strike back one was easy tho
 Kingooooo: This whole website shows me how much I suck
 Shrimpster: alright... so ive made a fairly descent MCTS algo for tictactoe that got me to top 100 in gold, to beat the bot what do I have to do? Just optimize machine circles? 
 Kingooooo: I can't complete this  apparently super easy CoC
 Schwase: which one?
 Schwase: was i in it or no?
 Kingooooo: nope
 Schwase: what mode
 Kingooooo: shortest
 Schwase: f
 Void9080: How did u do it so fast goddam
 Westicles: never fear, I have been steadily adding many high quality clashes.  eventually all clashes will be by me
 Kingooooo: Can I look at other people's solutions?
 Kingooooo: oh yeah nvm
 Void9080: wait how u do that
 Kingooooo: these people doing moon runes the frick
 jacek: Shrimpster how many simulations per turn do you get
 jacek: yes, uttt is optimization fest. though some universal mcts enhancements apply
 Void9080: How do you see other people solution?
 jacek: like C exploeration tuning,; checking for mate-in-one in tree and/or simulations every turn; mcts solver
 jacek: Void9080 if you solve puzzle you can see others people solutions
 Void9080: well f
 Void9080: im not gonna solve this hahaha
 jacek: oO
 Schwase: yo i levelled up yooo
 jacek: :tada:
 Arridian: How do I solve the error: not in a function on line 25?
 Arridian:  I tried googling it, nothing comes up.
 Arridian: Like 25 simple is while True:
 jacek: whats on line 25
 Arridian: It is just a "while True:"
 TheBlueBias: problem's before
 jacek: whats before and after
 jacek: is indentation ok
 Arridian: Before is the stuff they gave me when I started, I haven't changed it:
 Arridian: for i in range(link_count):
 Arridian: idk what could cause it
 Arridian: ima just reset the code
 Arridian: Okay, I got it to work, but for some reason after the first two turns it just stops working and just sits there. LEtting the enemy win.
 Arridian: This is my code:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/jLV4IYG">https://tech.io/snippet/jLV4IYG</a>
 darkhorse64: reset troops
 Arridian: wdym?
 jacek: what error do you get?
 Arridian: After a few minutes I get the error: Can't send a troop from a factory you don't control (7).
 jacek: you have biggest_factory before the loop. what if there is no biggest factory?
 Arridian: But for some reason my troops just stop sending after two turns
 Arridian: Then shouldn't it just use 0? as default value?
 darkhorse64: I mean that 'troops' keeps on growing
 Arridian: Oh, I see what you mean
 Westicles: Hey blaise, tell your french buddies to try my DAWG puzzle
 Arridian: What?
 TheBlueBias: DAWG?
 Westicles: just a contrib, don't want to spam it here

 Astrobytes:  /ban :P
 jacek: oh, a nine men's morris yet again on cotributions
 struct: i had to scroll so much
 struct: to get to the bottom
 Arridian: lol
 TheBlueBias: Graphs! Graphs are cool :heart_eyes:
 Westicles: I hate graphs.  I was just trying to fit in
 Arridian: lol
 Schwase: graphs *shudders*
 jacek: graphs?
 Schwase: physics major. PTSD. dont wanna talk about it
 jacek: physics?
 Schwase: what is...
 Schwase: PHYSICS?!?!
 Arridian: Does anyone know how I can solve the "Can't send troop from factory you don't control" in Ghost in the cell? My answer didn't work.
 Arridian: My answer was here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/7hcA6jv">https://tech.io/snippet/7hcA6jv</a>
 jacek: umm Westicles is this phone numbers thing?
 TheBlueBias: Was thinking about this too.
 struct: target_factory is not updated
 struct: is always 0
 Arridian: Oh, good point.
 Arridian: ty

 JHowell: Is there a way to go back to see the problem on a Code Clash after submission?
 SNEEDSTER: I don't think so
 JHowell: I thought I saw some one post some sort of database with all the clash problems but not solutions.
 StanleyKubricker: Waheeeey
 JHowell: Found it: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Arridian: Does anyone know a simple way to find whicever one of my factories has the most cyborgs in ghost in the cell?
 Dren: depends on how you store data
 Dren: i would imagine
 Arridian: Well, yeah.
 Arridian: I currently just have an array of "myfactories" and an array of "oppfactories"
 Arridian: And in each array is a tuple for factory id, cyborgs, and rate of creation
 Arridian: I tried to make a for statement that loops through and finds biggest, but it returns at Answer.py. not in a function on line 31 
 Arridian: idk how to fix it, because nothing comes up when you google it
 JHowell: so the cyborg count is the second value in each tuple? Are you recreating your array on each game loop, or updating an array created outside the loop?
 Arridian: I am rewriting with classes now, because I think it will be better. 
 Arridian: But thanks!
 JHowell: Yeah, I'd just suggest printing debugs to make sure the values you think you're comparing are what you think they are.
 Arridian: Okay thanks
 Westicles: ddawg

 Cyber_Glitch: um can anyone help me with this  one

 Dren: depends on the language i guess
 Dren: what do you need help with
 Westicles: I can tell you the validators are the same as the tests
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1e7cb8d5-5ae9-409e-b86d-3aa738e8ec48">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1e7cb8d5-5ae9-409e-b86d-3aa738e8ec48</a>
 Wontonimo: ^^ Cyber_Glitch that is for you
 Westicles: ooh, me next.  escaping the cat please
 Wontonimo: there exists a distance from the middle such that the mouse is able to make a revolution around the pool faster than the cat but just barely.  stay at that distance and revolve until the cat and mouse are on opposite side, then head straight to the outside
 Wontonimo: the distance is pool_radius * mouse_speed / cat_speed
 Wontonimo: just shy of that
 miszu: datastructure question for c++. Let's say you have an array of something and you want to get rid of the middle one, how could you do it so you don't compromise the array? Like I want to replace my vector with array
 Westicles: okay, I guess I should try it.  I hate 360 degree trig problems... always so many sign errors
 Wontonimo: are you going to insert something later?
 miszu: no, either iterate it or remove it
 Wontonimo: if it is a list of large sized classes, i manipulate a list of ints instead that point to their ordinal
 Wontonimo: i'm sure there is a better way
 Wontonimo: if it is a linked list, just change the link pointers.  again, ints can be used instead of hard pointers
 Wontonimo: for most CG games I don't do garbage collection in c++
 Wontonimo: no need
 miszu: alright
 miszu: I want to improve my speed at some point
 Wontonimo: i used singly linked list in UTTT for a very long time and it was pretty fast for dynamic addition and subtraction of elements.  Now I only add elements.
 Wontonimo: Westicles, I just finished <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/escaping-the-cat">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/escaping-the-cat</a>
 Wontonimo: thanks for suggesting that puzzle
 Westicles: nice
 Wontonimo: it wasn't as straight forward as my write up made it sound.  There were 2 hyper parameters that I had to tune because of the 350 frame limit
 Wontonimo: at a high level, certainly my original hypothesis was correct, just that the mouse radius has to be closer than I suggested so that it is solved in time.
 Wontonimo: there was a numberphile on this exact problem a couple years ago and I just remembered it.  Otherwise I wouldn't have had a clue 
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF_-ob9vseM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF_-ob9vseM</a>
 Wontonimo: found it
 Westicles: Yeah, I saw that.  Others said at the time you can run for the edge and zigzag and that works as well
 Westicles: Make the cat continually change directions

 Wontonimo: which one was that?
 Westicles: not sure, that was from an old chat by Uljahn
 Wontonimo: oh, that wasn't your replay
 Thorcode: Given a list of integers, multiply the even integers by 3 and the odd integers with 5. Return the sum of all the items after the multiplication.
 Thorcode: this puzzle is like an old puzzle yesterday a guy asking on this channel
 Thorcode: oh fortget it
 Westicles: the one you approved without solving it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: die(array_sum(array_map(function ($a) { $a*=($a%2?5:3);},$list)));

 Westicles: and everyone complained because it was clearly not ready
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did i not solve it right?
 Westicles: I meant Thorcode
 Thorcode: I solved it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i forgot the return
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh well, i don't CoC
 Thorcode: I forgot the question
 Westicles: it was a big scandal.  the validators and testcases are the same
 Thorcode: oh yeah so pp can use alot if
 Thorcode: well this puzzle could be shortest

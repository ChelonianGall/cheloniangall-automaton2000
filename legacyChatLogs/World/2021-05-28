 Greg_3141: Why isn't unlambda supported as a language? It's almost like codingame doesn't want to support readable and performant code

 sprkrd: I was just kidding, it's the first time I hear about that language
 sprkrd: So many languages today
 sprkrd: And still the best one is C :wink:
 Uljahn: i guess adding support for a new language is non-trivial, even updating current set of languages is hard for CG admins due to legacy architecture decisions

 KiwiTae: u can access the chat lvl1 if u good
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Scarfield: the minimum lvl for world chat was changed during a contest i think euler said, then never changed back - also hi&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: oh
 ZarthaxX: HAI scarfo
 Scarfield: oi
 Scarfield: trying to fix UTTT, was my first attempt at MCTS. Damn its a mess xD
 ZarthaxX: haha
 ZarthaxX: im gonna try that one soon i think
 MSmits: just keep it really really simple at first. 500-600 lines is possible
 struct: mine is under 500
 MSmits: my current version is 2k lines
 struct: im rewriting it atm
 struct: 2k o.o
 MSmits: but i think it's 300 lines of just different expansion functions :P
 ZarthaxX: legend with 500 lines??
 MSmits: yeah possible
 MSmits: easily
 ZarthaxX: for real
 ZarthaxX: i guess you need an optimized board tho
 MSmits: well easily if you're good at optimizing
 ZarthaxX: uttt performance was key right?
 ZarthaxX: just to have in mind
 struct: took me like 2-3 days
 MSmits: it's not enough though, if you want top 20
 ZarthaxX: struct you are too good
 MSmits: if you optimize to the max and do nothing else, you will not hit top 20 i think
 ZarthaxX: MSmits talking about getting into legend at least
 MSmits: yeah optimization is enough for that
 ZarthaxX: i guess you need to modify rollouts tho
 MSmits: I got in with C#
 struct: is solver + the teccles + fast good enough for top 20?
 MSmits: and it was vanilla
 MSmits: struct, might be
 struct: + reutilizing tree
 struct: I dont do any of that atm
 MSmits: well i dont really reuse tree
 Scarfield: :o
 MSmits: well the thing is i have reuse code
 struct: why not?
 MSmits: coded
 MSmits: but i make assumptions about the opponent
 Scarfield: all that pressious data
 MSmits: if the assumptions are wrong, tree is reset
 KalamariKing: precious*
 MSmits: and they are often wrong
 struct: ah
 struct: you prune enemy actions?
 MSmits: i assume opponent uses teccles
 MSmits: so if he doesnt, i have no tree to reuse
 ZarthaxX: oh c# legend
 struct: Does it play worse if you dont assume he plays teccles?
 ZarthaxX: nice then
 Scarfield: was about to look up the spelling, but figured you would know what i meant KalamariKing, but ty&#160;:)
 MSmits: not sure struct, but the idea is that you assume your opponent plays well, if you think teccles is optimal play, why not assume your opponent uses it
 struct: because you will be able to reuse tree more often
 struct: everytime*
 MSmits: yes but that seems pointless, i mean the whole idea is to explore with mcts. If your opponent is going to pick a bad move, you're not going to have much of a tree to use either
 MSmits: you're just extending that idea to not having  a tree at all
 MSmits: and having more of a tree from the teccles node
 struct: well cant you have larger exploration factor while you are still playing teccles?
 MSmits: sure, but why?
 MSmits: every visit that goes outside of the teccles branch is not going to the teccles branch
 MSmits: so it weakens the teccles branch reuse
 MSmits: and thats the most likely move
 struct: ah I see
 struct: but are the others that much worse?
 MSmits: maybe not, but even if they are just as good, the gain by placing a visit in a different branch is 0
 MSmits: only if the other branches are better, is it different
 MSmits: also remember that the effect of tree reuse is minimal
 MSmits: you lose most of the visits anyway
 struct: I think it would be worth it
 MSmits: oh, tree reuse is worth it, but the gain is around 10% or so
 MSmits: if your guess about teccles is correct, then the gain is 100%
 MSmits: because you keep the full tree
 MSmits: if it's not correct, it's a small loss
 MSmits: since almost every top player uses teccles...
 MSmits: even the NN's use it most of the time
 RoboStac: just checking a random game on mine (I've got no pruning) the teccles moves get 90% of the visits 
 MSmits: yeah, that kinda makes sense
 MSmits: that means tree reuse for the other moves does almost nothing
 struct: yours is NN too?
 RoboStac: so at most the tree reuse is starting with 400 visits which is basically just noise once you get past the enemy turn
 struct: oh I see you climbed, nice
 MSmits: oh hey RoboStac, this is for sure a NN
 MSmits: right?
 RoboStac: yeah
 KalamariKing: whats it called when a nn plays itself to train
 KalamariKing: rl + ___
 RoboStac: I finally worked out what I was doing wrong
 RoboStac: selfplay
 KalamariKing: yeah
 KalamariKing: how high would rl+selfplay get
 MSmits: what were you doing wrong RoboStac?
 MSmits: KalamariKing in most boardgames, rank 1
 MSmits: if you do it better than others
 RoboStac: a few things - I'd reused my original code so it was pruning moves. Also changing the input format so small boards didn't have the leftover moves on helped a lot.
 MSmits: what are leftover moves?
 RoboStac: the final state of the small board
 RoboStac: it's irrelevant to the eval
 RoboStac: other than win / loss / draw
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: all this NN action only shows how amazing karliso's bot is :P
 struct: MSmits do you take into account if the miniboard can still be finished by either player?
 1415495: selfplay may or may not converge to a stable policy or cycle through multiple policies, I think that if it does converge to a stable policy, then it is a nash equilibirum but I am unsure that I have correctly understood the theory on that point
 MSmits: yeah struct
 MSmits: i do
 ddreams: which game are you talking about?
 MSmits: ultimate tic tac toe ddreams
 struct: thanks, I was thinking on also adding that
 MSmits: I have a really slow expansion function that checks all that stuff
 ddreams: right, never tried
 MSmits: is a win still possible for p1, for p2 etc.
 struct: yeah, makes sense
 MSmits: only have like 60k-65k rollouts now
 struct: "only"
 MSmits: well at one time i could get 130k on a good cpu&#160;:)
 MSmits: when expanding i also exclude moves where the opponent could get a win if you made them
 MSmits: so if a winning board is in the top left corner for opponent
 MSmits: then i never allow any top left moves in any miniboard, nor do i allow moves giving a free move
 MSmits: unless they are winning moves
 MSmits: expansion is almost like a ply 2 mimimax
 struct: even if the opponent move would allow you to place anywhere in the board?
 struct: ah I see
 MSmits: no i mean a game winning move
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: so if the opponent can get 3 boards in a row by winning top left and he can win there with 1 opporunity to move
 struct: Understood, thanks
 MSmits: kk
 MSmits: all these checks are quite slow
 MSmits: which is why i have different expansion functions
 MSmits: one for early game and one for mid game
 MSmits: so &lt; 2 boards finished, i use the early game expansion which is fast
 KalamariKing: could you somehow use online matches for rl?
 struct: I see
 MSmits: kinda KalamariKing
 MSmits: you can download json files and use the gamestates for learning
 MSmits: it's more supervised though
 MSmits: well not sure, in any case, you can use the information
 MSmits: however, this is *very* similar to counterbooking
 MSmits: because you're learning to counter that specific player you're downloading matches against
 MSmits: probably, if the other player submits a new version, all that learning is wasted
 MSmits: proper self-play learning that guarantees generalization is better
 KalamariKing: ok true
 MSmits: but i proved that that can be counterbooked against also, because these bots usually become deterministic to some extent. my conclusion is that we should just avoid counterbooking. It's unbeatable
 KiwiTae: u use cg api to download the matches streams?
 KalamariKing: but if both players in self-play converge to an 'ideal' play-style, then the games will all be exactly the same and no learning will be done
 KalamariKing: if that makes sense
 KalamariKing: the 'ideal' playstyle would only be ideal when playing itself
 MSmits: KalamariKing the problem is that a NN never becomes perfect. It almost always makes at least one mistake
 RoboStac: you need some sort of noise/randomness in selfplay to stop it being deterministic
 MSmits: and from a solved game perspective, a single mistake is enough to turn a win in  a loss
 MSmits: into
 MSmits: RoboStac yeah, but this is not easy to do. Jacek mostly manages it, but if I want to, I can still counter it to a 50+&#160;% win
 RoboStac: yeah, but thats  the submitted versions
 MSmits: yes, and he can always resubmit
 RoboStac: the learning in selfplay has a lot more randomness
 MSmits: it has to
 MSmits: or it wont be generalized
 RoboStac: yeah
 MSmits: RoboStac do you think if you knew for every gamestate in oware, what the solved value is, you'd be able to make a better NN?
 MSmits: say assuming there are infinite turns (thats more doable)
 MSmits: turn limit complicates things
 MSmits: I'm just wondering if a supervised learning bot using these values would do better than a good selflplay bot
 MSmits: you could make it do selfplay anyways, but instead of using values from the rollout, you just take the states and look up the game-theoretical value
 RoboStac: I've no idea. I'd be worried about really long sequences of moves that lead to a win but are hard to find 
 RoboStac: because you'd be teaching it this state is good, but it might not be able to find out why
 MSmits: this is from a policy perspective right
 MSmits: i should clarify, you have the solved seed counts, not just the WLD
 RoboStac: value too - it won't be perfectly accurate so you might get some states on the way that eval slightly lower
 MSmits: right, so you're saying selfplay would value states that win much later, lower, so that you will be able to win sooner
 RoboStac: well, it would probably just never find the long sequence of exactly perfect moves
 RoboStac: I'm not sure how much that is an issue in oware 
 MSmits: right, it's a valid concern
 RoboStac: I think it would probably work quite well though
 MSmits: I want to set up supervised learning for oware. Trying to enlarge my endgame db to 30 seeds or so and use a well searched meta mcts for the 31-48 seeds
 MSmits: ingame, it would have a 9 or 10 endgame db, so it doesnt need to learn on that part
 MSmits: still not sure about the one-hot part
 MSmits: i get why you and jacek use one-hot, but ... soooo many inputs
 MSmits: for my TTT, one hot wasnt better. Not that that proves anything
 Uljahn: just more features for nn to choose from
 MSmits: yeah, oware is special because specific seed counts do different thing
 Uljahn: also RL with expert demonstrations (replay data) is called Imitation Learning<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://smartlabai.medium.com/a-brief-overview-of-imitation-learning-8a8a75c44a9c">https://smartlabai.medium.com/a-brief-overview-of-imitation-learning-8a8a75c44a9c</a>
 MSmits: so it makes sense to one-hot them
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: isnt RL a huge umbrella term?
 MSmits: requiring clarification every time?
 Uljahn: true
 -oa-: hi all!
 MSmits: hi -oa-
 derjack: moshi moshi
 KalamariKing: MSmits you say rl is an umbrella term... what's under it?
 derjack: well is alphazero-like really RL? or more like self supervised learning but it gets labels from searched self
 MSmits: KalamariKing I am not an expert, but when i google RL I find tons and tons of different things
 MSmits: TD learning is RL for example
 KalamariKing: td?
 MSmits: temporal difference
 herrmann: Generally, if you learn a function Q(S,A) "what's the value of applying action A in state S" it's RL
 MSmits: but that's Q learning
 MSmits: isnt it?
 derjack: q learning is rl
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: so that was my point :P
 MSmits: it's all RL
 herrmann: AlphaZero has V(S) and a policy pi(S) -&gt; A
 herrmann: V(S) is the marginalized Q(S,A)
 KalamariKing: What IS q-learning
 Uljahn: what is learning
 MSmits: i can tell you the simples possible form of Q learning
 herrmann: These things are "RLish", but, yes, it's a large sub-area
 derjack: but it periodically gathers experience into buffer and then learns from it in supervised fashion
 KalamariKing: learn a func to predict gamestate at next timesetep?
 MSmits: play games, learn for every possible state what the best action was
 KalamariKing: I see
 MSmits: put it all in a table
 MSmits: and play games using that table
 KalamariKing: That doesnt seem very nn tho
 MSmits: it's not
 KalamariKing: oh ok
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: it doesnt have neurons
 MSmits: it's ML though
 KalamariKing: how does it learn?
 KalamariKing: as in how does it update past experience
 derjack: you can change table into nn
 KalamariKing: but then is it q learning
 herrmann: Experience Replay is also a form of making supervised learning into reinforcement learning
 MSmits: every time it plays a game, it checks all states it has seen and updates with the endgame value
 KalamariKing: or just rl
 MSmits: i can give you an example of Q learning, sec
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://trinket.io/python/6cd0e1872a?outputOnly=true">https://trinket.io/python/6cd0e1872a?outputOnly=true</a>
 MSmits: play like 10 games or so
 MSmits: and you will start losing
 MSmits: because it is q-learning
 herrmann: Tabular Q-learning is RL without a NN, but if that table is huge you won't be able to have values for every cell, so you need to generalize, and for that you can use a NN or something else
 MSmits: btw, the goal of the game is using pawn moves and reaching the other side, if you cant move, you lose
 MSmits: rules are close to breakthrough, but not exactly
 KalamariKing: I see your point MSmits its starting to learn
 MSmits: if you change the adress to outputonly = false, you can see the code
 MSmits: but it's probably not easy to read
 MSmits: it's basically using a table of states and their possible moves
 KalamariKing: yeah
 MSmits: remembering the succes of earlier games sort of
 KalamariKing: interesting
 KalamariKing: so that's q learning you said?
 MSmits: it takes current value * (1 - lr) + latest result * lr
 MSmits: lr being learning rate
 MSmits: it has 50% learning rate or s
 MSmits: o
 MSmits: yes its q learning
 MSmits: but super simple, because it only works for simple games
 MSmits: you cant do this for a game with billions of states or more
 herrmann: Q-learning is for when you don't know the dynamics... here the dynamics are usually given in the form of te game's rules
 MSmits: yeah it is, but you can use it also when you do know the dynamics
 MSmits: you can even use it to solve a maze
 herrmann: Yes, but usually not the full Q(S,A) learning
 MSmits: instead of a pathfinding algorithm
 herrmann: AlphaZero is an example too
 MSmits: could that be considered Q learning?
 herrmann: Not Q-learning, but "yes RL"&#160;;-)
 MSmits: ah yes
 MSmits: it's all RL&#160;:)

 DominoSv: ok
 MSmits: other games usually dont have this, the game changes but the input stays the same
 DominoSv: i have reset
 MSmits: then you can start coding again&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: enjoy :hug:
 DominoSv: i dont know what to do
 derjack: oo
 Uljahn: think
 struct: There is a tutorial
 struct: I think
 MSmits: DominoSv I would suggest trying practice puzzles if you're just trying to get better at using code to solve problems
 MSmits: easy ones
 MSmits: try multiple different ones if you fail on a lot of them. If you can tsolve a single one, then you need more basic training in your language
 DominoSv: ok
 MSmits: it's ok to be stuck for an hour on an easy practice puzzle, if you're new, but not half a day
 MSmits: when i learned python with easy puzzles i sometimes took an hour because i couldnt figure out how to make python do what i wanted
 DominoSv: i am trying to learn c# 
 MSmits: that was my first language
 MSmits: its a good place to start
 DominoSv: thx
 DominoSv: any more pointers
 ddreams: those are more common in C/C++
 DominoSv: oh ok
 ddreams: :p
 ddreams: C# is a great language
 MSmits: ddreams is making a c++ joke DominoSv, pointers are a thing in c++
 MSmits: DominoSv use google a lot
 MSmits: in fact you can find whole solutions to the most common puzzles here, but try not to copy them, bette rto find it yourself

 Wontonimo: good morning (or afternoon for those on the other side of the planet)

 Wontonimo: being a student is very hard balance between real learning and performing on assignments and tests
 MSmits: yep
 ddreams: well, if you only focus on the first you should do well on the second
 MSmits: but might be more time intensive in the short term
 Wontonimo: but it takes much more effort.  yeah, what MSmits said ^^
 Wontonimo: i agree with you ddreams, and mostly tried to do that in uni
 Wontonimo: my grades weren't awesome, but man did i learn a lot
 ddreams: which is the only thing that matters in my opinion
 reCurse: Seems naive
 reCurse: The second is most important while you try to fit in the first through other means
 ddreams: What's naive?
 MSmits: from a effort vs immediate reward perspective you are right
 reCurse: Focusing on the first doing well on the second
 reCurse: Is naive imo
 MSmits: that's not a general truth. It depends a lot on the quality of education and quality of testing
 MSmits: if the education is bad or the test is bad, then you're right
 reCurse: I've yet to see that work out, but I won't pretend I know every education of course
 derjack: the point is: dont overfit to test&#160;:*
 MSmits: I'd like to think I mostly succeed in this in my physics or CS testing at least. 
 MSmits: well overfitting definitely happens&#160;:)
 reCurse: I might have just a strong bias against classes shrug
 Wontonimo: are we talking bias and overfitting again?  :D
 MSmits: I've mentored some students that told me they were pissed at their math teacher
 Wontonimo: why?
 MSmits: "He taught us how pentagons work and on the test he did a hexagon: 
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's sad
 derjack: bias against classes? so youre into struct?
 MSmits: struct &gt; class no typing public
 MSmits: less typing = good
 Wontonimo: lol
 MSmits: it's just confusing when coming from C#
 MSmits: structs are completely different there
 ddreams: I think formal education is a waste of time for many people.. with careful selection of subjects you could manage to pass the CS curriculum with a bare minimum of coding experience
 ddreams: at least at my uni
 reCurse: Still need to go through it to open the doors
 reCurse: Just need a side-study to do the learning that matters
 ddreams: for programmers, the door is quite open
 Greg_3141: Why would you go to university for practical coding experience? You can do that at a job; that way you get paid instead of paying a university
 jacek: bronze in code a la mode :tada:
 Greg_3141: your bot must be very advanced
 reCurse: Yeah good luck getting the job
 reCurse: You probably won't make it past the basic filters
 ddreams: I did it myself, worked for several years before going to uni
 Greg_3141: depends on the job, but even $30k/year is better than a negative salary (AKA tuition fees)
 MSmits: reCurse i think the bias in your experience is strong (not your fault), all my RL friends have the same experience. They did 5 years of computer science and at the end they barely learned to code
 reCurse: Not if you make a lot more after you're doing with tuition
 MSmits: my experience in physics is way different
 Wontonimo: i don't know what it is like now at uni, but there internet was very young when I went and Netscape just release the first browser.  Uni was very important then.  I imagine with so much online now, the education system is undergoing huge change and an existential crisis 
 Wontonimo: but I don't have first hand experience in this new era
 reCurse: It's still a basic filter to weed out thousands of resumes
 reCurse: You can still make do without, just on hard mode instead
 ddreams: really? I thought it'd be more important now.. I got hired in '00 after finishing high school 
 Greg_3141: From what I can tell, the point of a CS degree is to understand the theory of the subject (algorithms, grammars, etc). IMO complaining that you didn't get much coding experience as a CS major is like complaining that you didn't do a bunch of integrals by hand as a math major
 ddreams: I think the competition is much greater now
 jacek: nowadays in CS/IT studies, if you dont do almost all by yourself, youll learn nothing
 MSmits: I wonder how hard it would be for me to get a coding job
 ddreams: Very easy, I believe
 jacek: in other studies like physics it is less noticeable
 MSmits: I have a physics master and only CS teaching degree, not an actual CS bachelor or master
 reCurse: Greg you're correct in theory and technically
 reCurse: In practice tons of people go through that with the expectation of having a job, which is a reasonable one
 reCurse: And the system fails them
 Wontonimo: physics master gets you in.  it's a math background, grounded in logic and deduction
 MSmits: ah ok cool
 ddreams: even without your physics, you could probably have a job next week if you wanted
 MSmits: I guess it depends on how picky you are. Coders seem to be in short supply
 KalamariKing: There's a shortage of cs majors who actually know how to code
 KalamariKing: its all theoretical nowadays, and businesses can;t use that
 ddreams: Exactly
 reCurse: They want the degree and the relevant knowledge
 reCurse: That's why you need to do both
 reCurse: It sucks but that's how it is
 MSmits: we have a level of education thats below university, but still called higher education, it gives out bacherlors degrees. That's not theoretical at all. These guys know how to code
 ddreams: If you're good at coding, you don't need it, imo
 reCurse: You will close yourself a ton of doors
 reCurse: You might still go through
 reCurse: Just be warned
 Wontonimo: 2/3rds of our developers are front end.  make buttons clickable, format the page, get the right colours displayed.  Don't need a lot of algorithm theory for that, you need dedication to grind and speed 
 MSmits: this seems like a horrible job to me&#160;:(
 MSmits: well maybe not horrible
 Greg_3141: yeah probably is
 MSmits: but not fun
 Wontonimo: I am not in that group.  it would be a horrible job for me too
 ddreams: Backend is a much better place
 Greg_3141: you could probably get a job as a quantum computing researcher or something
 Greg_3141: if you wanted to
 MSmits: nahh too late for that Greg_3141&#160;:)
 MSmits: my masters was astrophysics
 MSmits: lots of computer science goes into that field as well
 MSmits: modelling and working with tons of data
 Wontonimo: then you are in.
 MSmits: probably some machine learning as well these days
 Greg_3141: They're starting to use machine learning at CERN, it's pretty interesting
 KalamariKing: Machine learning for? astrophysics?
 linjoehan: lol I got kicked from my last job because our team started doing frontend stuff. It's boring and I don't know how to do it.
 MSmits: I am pretty sure they created neural networks for spectral classification already
 MSmits: without needing to look that up
 KalamariKing: Wow alright
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8341">https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8341</a>
 MSmits: just looked it up :P
 Wontonimo: from 2014 none-the-less
 KalamariKing: Yeah, wow
 ddreams: perhaps you ML masters should join the cancer mole recognition competition 
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://siim.org/page/melanoma_classification_challenge">https://siim.org/page/melanoma_classification_challenge</a>
 MSmits: ye moles are a cancer, all those holes in your backyard
 Wontonimo: ML is just getting into anything to do with classification, clustering, and search
 jacek: who cares about cancer. im waiting for certain bioengineering task
 Wontonimo: which bioengineering task?
 KalamariKing: I saw something like that, that ml is used for detecting cancer and diabetes/kidney damage and stuff
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-79a3cbbe45b61891c1cab3435dfdb090.webp">https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-79a3cbbe45b61891c1cab3435dfdb090.webp</a>
 MSmits: biology has an entire field where they identify species and such. Those guys will be redundant unless they get into ML themselves
 reCurse: People seem to forget you still need datasets...
 Greg_3141: What certifications do recruiters on codingame look for? Silver? Gold? Legend?
 MSmits: yeah ofc
 ddreams: Datasets are part of the competition
 reCurse: I was responding to MSmits
 linjoehan: I think there was a dog trained to sniff for cancer so we've had the technology for a while
 ddreams: ah, right
 Wontonimo: i have no idea Greg_3141 .  I've not been contacted, so couldn't tell you.
 KalamariKing: Companies contact people on cg?
 reCurse: I don't think any recruiter cares at all about CG certifications
 reCurse: I wouldn't bother putting those
 KalamariKing: I knew they did for sponsored contests, etc
 MSmits: nah they just make you solve a puzzle here
 KalamariKing: oh ok cool
 MSmits: one time I got 69th out of 1000 on some sponsored contest and I accidentally checked the contact for jobs box
 MSmits: and got a phone call
 MSmits: from France...
 Bishwo: nice
 KalamariKing: lol looking to move
 MSmits: then I said I wasnt looking for a job in France
 reCurse: :french_bread:
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: and they called me back a few days later
 linjoehan: I'd mention CG but not to the recruiter though bring it up in your later interviews
 ZarthaxX: nice :O
 MSmits: with a job offer from England
 ZarthaxX: O.O
 MSmits: this is with 69th rank :P
 Wontonimo: there you go, why you asking if you can get a coding job?
 ZarthaxX: what contest was this
 MSmits: Amadeus i think
 MSmits: the gitc clone
 KalamariKing: you're not in the states right
 reCurse: Sponsored competition is different though, that was the whole point
 MSmits: I am in the Netherlands
 reCurse: CG certifications though, different altogether
 KalamariKing: y'all are weird. I heard something that you all won't drive 30-40 minutes for a good job opportunity... over here, living 2-3 hours from your job is normal
 jacek: sounds like US thing
 Wontonimo: that sir is weird
 MSmits:  you mean you *think* it's normal, but you're all out of your mind :P
 ddreams: and you drive there every day?
 ddreams: or do you have an apartment there?
 ZarthaxX: ah amadeus one, makes more sense then
 MSmits: I have to travel 60 min to my job, 35 min train 25 min walk
 Wontonimo: that is a significant portion of your life driving
 MSmits: people consider me to live far from work
 Wontonimo: 60 min is more reasonable, with a good amount being exercise
 ddreams: yeah, I have refused jobs 60 minutes driving away
 Greg_3141: may as well become a trucker then, if you drive 4 to 6 hours per day&#160;:)
 MSmits: Wontonimo yeah and i get to work/relax in train, using train wifi (that mostly works)
 Illedan: Being a trucker would give me more time for hobby coding though :D
 ddreams: I've basically worked mostly remotely since 2011 though
 Illedan: *more mental capacity
 MSmits: Illedan maybe when self driving cars get better :P
 MSmits: oh mental capacity.. sure
 Illedan: Where do you work ddreams?
 Wontonimo: i've been remote for the last 4 years.  It's been great.  I don't want to go back
 jacek: then release another virus
 jacek: [solved]
 ddreams: I work as a consultant in my own company
 MSmits: lol
 Greg_3141: nice
 Illedan: Chill
 Wontonimo: but you must have clients, or the revenue will be low
 ddreams: so for several different clients
 jacek: do you like your boss
 Illedan: I guess it's complicated
 ddreams: hehe
 MSmits: he doesnt have a boss, he's a consultant
 ddreams: currently writing ship simulators for Kongsberg Maritime
 Wontonimo: he has multiple bosses
 MSmits: nice
 Greg_3141: what software do you use for it, if any? Unity, maybe?
 MSmits: unreal engine?
 Wontonimo: what kind of things are you simulating with about the ships?  voyage, cargo, repairs and maintenance&#160;?
 Illedan: Maybe going full CG on the simulation? Meta MCTS ship search?
 ddreams: currently they're using an in-house engine
 MSmits: maybe it's one of those ships that is self-sustaining to house the last remaining survivors of the apocalypse
 Wontonimo: and is self aware
 MSmits: yeah
 Greg_3141: Interesting. Does it look good?
 ddreams: it looks pretty crap, compared to games
 MSmits: Greg_3141 goes straight to the center of the matter
 struct: it doesnt need to look good
 Greg_3141: come on, it can't look bad compared to roblox
 ddreams: all the focus have been on accuracy
 jacek: is this for ooc
 Illedan: I heard about that engine during a job interview last year
 Wontonimo: i would be worried if it looked awesome; sure sign that it is all smoke and mirrors in the backend cuz they spent all their money on flashy flash
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/videos/new-police-coast-guard-simulators-make-training-safer-more-13154072#.X3E5uGVxgdo.whatsapp">https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/videos/new-police-coast-guard-simulators-make-training-safer-more-13154072#.X3E5uGVxgdo.whatsapp</a>
 Greg_3141: looks kind of like roblox
 struct: so its a bot simulator
 struct: nice
 Wontonimo: oh, that kind of simulation.  I thought it was a logistics simulation not a pilot sim
 MSmits: that needs a lot of physics
 struct: im going to port it
 struct: to cg
 Illedan: OOC 3D?
 Greg_3141: I wonder how Roblox manages to charge such a high rate for people to use their shitty engine
 Westicles: can it sim going sideways in the suez canal?
 struct: you need suez dlc for that
 KalamariKing: There's plenty of 6yr olds to play roblox, so if the devs can get in-app purchases, they're making bank
 ddreams: haha, yes, would be fun to set up that exercise
 struct: Does it also generate real world?
 struct: like flight simulator
 MSmits: isnt flight simulator real world mostly used to find your house and crash it there&#160;?
 ddreams: generate? all the exercise areas are prepared in advance
 ddreams: there are some visuals generated
 struct: I think current flight simulator generates real map
 Greg_3141: You should make a somalian hijacker exercise
 struct: based on satelite image
 MSmits: yeah, so your house is on there
 sprkrd: Flight simulator 2020 simulates even real time weather
 sprkrd: It even has integration with a training platform for ATC
 sprkrd: So you get realistic dialog from ATC trainees
 sprkrd: However it has a bad reputation regarding the gigantic size of the game (around 120GB I believe, and then you have to download 100GB more for the first update)
 MSmits: ouch
 struct: dont you also download stuff while playing?
 sprkrd: real time satellite images, probably?
 struct: I guess so
 reCurse: Realistic visuals, small file size, pick one
 sprkrd: and weather info
 sprkrd: I think the bulk of the game is the map
 sprkrd: I guess it downloads a default map for the whole world for when you're playing offline
 sprkrd: Google Earth style
 reCurse: If that's the main complaint the game is doing very fine
 Westicles: about the same size as MS Word
 ddreams: yeah, would be a nonissue for me
 ddreams: assuming I'd be interested in flight sims
 sprkrd: I don't think it's too bad either
 sprkrd: But I'm not such a fan of planes either :joy:
 Wontonimo: is there multiplayer where you have to coordinate landing at the same airport?
 sprkrd: Yes
 Wontonimo: nice
 sprkrd: That's one of the selling points
 KalamariKing: :o
 KalamariKing: that sounds epic
 sprkrd: You share airspace and airports with other pilots and with ATC trainees
 Wontonimo: could also train as a ATC
 sprkrd: if you play online, that is
 sprkrd: But that was the case also in the previous FS
 sprkrd: Except ATCs were mostly regular Doufus and Roufus, not serious ATC trainees
 Wontonimo: compared to the cost of actual flight classes, it's a fantastic alternative
 sprkrd: And there are more trolls
 sprkrd: I mean, you should do both if you wanna fly real life :joy:
 sprkrd: Otherwise you won't get your licence
 Wontonimo: i've heard that US fighter pilots spend a lot of time in simulators vs real flights
 Greg_3141: flight simulators are fun
 sprkrd: For fighter planes there are better simulators than FS
 AntiSquid: you doing kaggle ddreams&#160;?
 ddreams: not really
 ddreams: you?
 ddreams: mentored a young guy for that melanoma competition I mentioned earlier
 ddreams: otherwise I've only been browsing them
 KalamariKing: splix.io with hexagons?
 KalamariKing: good idea for personal challenge or no
 KalamariKing: I've never done too much game dev so is there something rather complex I just can't see
 AntiSquid: ya that contest ended a long time ago ddreams 
 Westicles: Hexagons are passe.  Now everyone is doing Pentakis Icosidodecahedrons

 Smelty:&#160;:( i dropped 300 ranks in CoC
 KalamariKing: My rank dropped too, but only by a hundred or soA few dozen games later and we're back to 250ish
 Zimtime907: So sad:joy:
 linjoehan: man I dropped to mater gonna go do some practice problems to get back up
 ZarthaxX: linjoehan get that top 100!
 Westicles: It will just decay again.  A Sisyphean task
 DarrenLachance: i'm so bad at coding
 ddreams: Practice
 DarrenLachance: thanks. I will keep going
 KalamariKing: ddreams so inspirational
 ddreams: Thanks&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: you should look into motivational speaking
 KalamariKing: get a 2-hr block, walk on stage and say "practice", and leave
 ddreams: Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?
 KalamariKing: true

 KalamariKing: I don't think you can learn mips as fast as this says
 KalamariKing: it doesn't give a timestamp per se but still
 ddreams: Assembly is not so hard to learn, it's just incredibly tedious
 KalamariKing: I kinda wanna learn assembly
 1rre: I mean it depends, once you know C it's basically the same thing, and C isn't a huge step from C++/Rust, which isn't a huge step from Java etc
 KalamariKing: Furbies ran something similar to 6502s so I wanna make my own furby
 KalamariKing: That's the only reason, yep
 ddreams: The best way to write anything big in assembly is to write it in C and then use the output as a starting point
 1rre: Big brain learn assembly by writing your own compiler
 KalamariKing: Thats actually pretty smart ddreams
 KalamariKing: I was gonna say can't you compile a program and then use that
 1rre: It depends how long it is, you don't wanna be trying to figure out millions of lines
 ddreams: That's pretty smart, KalamariKing
 ddreams: 1rre, you don't want to write millions of lines of assembly either
 ddreams: and the C compiler can give you annotated output
 KalamariKing: Ofc 1rre but if you wanna do something like tetris, wouldn't it be smarter to write it in something like C (without libs tho) and use that on a microchip
 ddreams: It'd be smartest to choose a chip where a compiler exists :p
 KalamariKing: True
 ddreams: Learning some inline assembly is useful though
 KalamariKing: But maybe I really wanna run the furby original source code on my ryzen 3600x
 KalamariKing: Overclocked furbies anyone?
 KalamariKing: what if you had to program everything from binary
 KalamariKing: it's not that far from hex which isn't far from assembly
 ddreams: then you'd first write an assembler
 aayux: ok
 aayux: yo whatsapp
 KalamariKing: right but what if you didn't have a computer
 KalamariKing: just a microprocessor to run everything and a rom to store it, plus some way to store individual bits in the rom
 ddreams: then I guess I'm enjoying my vacation?
 KalamariKing: and you had to code it all in binary
 ddreams: reminds me of that story about Bill Gates
 KalamariKing: wait did he actually
 1rre: I thought it was linus torvalds but sure
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07aU7DJiMws&amp;t=162s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07aU7DJiMws&amp;t=162s</a>
 sprkrd: what, you wanna program in punchcards now?
 sprkrd: you go this route you will end laying out the transistors yourself
 sprkrd: I have some experience with PIC (the microcontrollers from Microchip). There's a compiler for that, and you can simulate it using proteus. Maybe you'd like to take a look at that&#160;:)
 sprkrd: Programmable both in C and in asm
 KalamariKing: that's it I'm running nes games on a furby
 KalamariKing: nothing can stop me except a shortage of furbies in which case I'll make my own
 sprkrd: then even a shortage of furbies won't stop you, right?
 KalamariKing: exactly
 KalamariKing: only a slight hinderance
 sprkrd: which means you can cut your sentence before the except :joy:
 KalamariKing: which meansshut up
 sprkrd: :O
 KalamariKing: don't make me build a furby army
 sprkrd: sheer determination and will
 KalamariKing: idea: they're all controllable from one central hub
 KalamariKing: thats literally an army of furbies this is beautiful
 onlyhuman: sup guys
 onlyhuman: this site's pretty cool :D
 KalamariKing: I agree
 Nerchio: I agree
 sprkrd: onlyhuman that's what a bot would say :thinking:
 onlyhuman: I agree

 KalamariKing: sounds like a bot to me
 ddreams: everyone here is a bot, except you
 KalamariKing: spooky
 KalamariKing: interesting that a bot would want to talk of building a furby army with me
 starboy35442: im not a bot
 Nerchio: if you were a bot how would you know 
 starboy35442: idk

 KalamariKing: not much but getting larger with every passing day
 jacek: 3. bioengineering cat girls
 KalamariKing: now we're thinking
 1rre: 2 things I wish they had:ErlangThe ability to run scala as scripts rather than having to have apps
 KalamariKing: I really wanna build a centralized-intelligence furby hive-mind army though
 KalamariKing: like cmon
 1rre: ok but seriously why do we have to have "object Solution extends App", where we can't even rename solution, when Python don't have to have their function called something specific which is called from another file
 KalamariKing: because python runs like crap with anything more than print("hello world")
 1rre: Yeah I refuse to use it but for the shortest one's it's just such an uneven playing field
 1rre: I just want my Erlang&#160;:'(
 1rre: Tbh I'm actually just super grateful that the scala version they use is up to date here (ish, 1 minor version behind), you get so many places that run like decade old versions
 jacek: they updated many languages recently
 KalamariKing: why does 13.2/10 in python return 1.3199999999999
 ddreams: floating point limitation
 KalamariKing: thought so but why does that matter for such small numbers?
 ddreams: it's not representable in binary

 KiwiTae: King_Coda you went legend on hypersonic? is that the boomberman one?
 King_Coda: Yes KiwiTae
 cw477: Rocking faces in clash of code
 King_Coda: I'm technically not getting promoted for another 4 hours and 2 minutes, but yes
 King_Coda: I coded in C++
 Xascoria: yea im new in the game
 struct: sure 
 reCurse: Which repository?
 struct: same from the others
 struct: he didnt even bother removing the message
 jacek:&#160;?
 reCurse: Imagine being so insecure you need to lie about it
 jacek: oh my
 PatrickMcGinnisII: uh oh
 struct: I usually say they are only fooling themselves
 cw477: Then welcome man
 MSmits: Sayonara!
 reCurse: Farewell?
 MSmits: thats one of them HS kimibot messages
 reCurse: Oh
 MSmits: i checked out some battles of Coda, indeed it's another clone
 reCurse: I just trusted struct hehe
 MSmits: yeah struct is pretty reliable
 therealbeef: is that legal?
 MSmits: no
 reCurse: Legal sure
 Xascoria: i really like clash, been playing it a lot with my friends
 reCurse: Pretending you wrote it, pathetic
 Xascoria:&#160;?
 Xascoria: sorry?
 struct: is not talking to you
 Xascoria: oh mb
 MSmits: unless you're stealing bots too :P
 MSmits: you know I took a serious look at kimi's code to see if i could use anything form there, but it made my head hurt
 struct: the gold boss doesnt even work
 struct: timeout turn 1
 MSmits: HS gold?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: explains why legend got so big
 MSmits: i remember it being 160 or so
 struct: 500 now
 MSmits: I guess gold boss broke due to some update
 PatrickMcGinnisII: HS=hyperSonic?
 MSmits: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, i got stuck in silver ... but I didn't put effort into it
 MSmits: ahh yeah i have some multis like that
 RoboStac: sounds like nows the time to reach gold for easy legend xp 
 reCurse: Still need top gold
 MSmits: top gold is easy now
 MSmits: the best gold bots are in legend
 reCurse: Oh because of all the promotions, yeah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, ok.. find me a php bot worthy of copy/paste  lol
 reCurse: Ask King_Coda
 RoboStac: if you submit enough all you have to do is survive to turn 2
 RoboStac: eventually the boss will go negative
 MSmits: emptying gold league?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hey King_Coda is there a php version on github?&#160;;)
 RoboStac: if it drops 13 more places saiksy will get promoted and wonder why 
 RoboStac: maybe it'll get fixed then
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits is like 6th...yea no complaints there.&#160;;)
 MSmits: it's a bit random, my bot is on par with Robo's
 MSmits: i did thousands of CG bench :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: new volcanoes game isn't that fun to code.&#160;:(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sry
 jacek: oO
 jacek: maybe theres code on repo
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII is not a repo man
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :champagne_glass:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol jacek
 jacek: i see. at my work php guys use svn while everyone else are git
 MSmits: php-eople are contrary :P
 jacek: ahh theres only wood3 boss there
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt; we use svn at my job too 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is that like docker?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I fired my helpers yesterday, so now I'm burnt out from remodeling a house today.  Little basterds making me work hard.
 KiwiTae: nah docker is virtual machine, svn is version control
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok tx KiwiTae, leaning sumtin everyday
 MSmits: I finally learned how to do an index function for oware so i dont need to hash states
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh god, i adjusted my monitor... the cat saw me...gotta hide
 MSmits: why are you afraid of your cat
 reCurse: Why wouldn't he
 MSmits: good point. But cats are varied. There are many reasons one can be afraid of them
 jacek: give him some toxoplasmosis then
 MSmits: oO
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, gave the cat the &lt;3... damn keyboard pirate
 MSmits: damn... looking up by hash is really slow isn't it? I replaced my unordered set with a pretty complex index function, but the whole endgame book generator is over twice as fast
 MSmits: the index function includes a loop and 12 array lookups
 MSmits: to replace 1 unordered set call
 PatrickMcGinnisII: There's a bin drop hash, damn i ferget the name ... yea using a linear index should speed it up like 10x
 MSmits: i think it is more than 10x in this case. It is also a lot more memory efficient. I was using an unordered set to look up an array index
 struct: did you add stuff to unordered_map?
 struct: or just at the start?
 MSmits: not just at the start
 MSmits: all the time
 struct: yeah its normal that is slow
 MSmits: I needed to store where in my array a state was located
 struct: I was reading the other day about it
 MSmits: I knew that it was slow... I just didnt know it was *this* slow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u guys r always pushing the envelope
 MSmits: speaking of pushing the envelope, i also found a way to make my process use more than 2 GB RAM
 struct: ok so when the map reaches a certain threshold, the number of buckets increase and map gets hashed again
 MSmits: I guess vectors can go beyond it
 Azna: Hello
 RoboStac: were you compiling for 32bit?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: but array declarations could not go beyond 32 bit anyways
 MSmits: vector&lt;uint64_t&gt; states(2000000000);
 MSmits: this worked though
 MSmits: uint64_t states[2000000000] does not
 Azna: Is anyone here good with matrixes and queues xD? (char[,]) c#?
 RoboStac: that would be 16gb?
 MSmits: yeah somewhere around that
 MSmits: i started process and saw it use something like 19 gb 
 RoboStac: thats somewhat different to 2gb&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 MSmits: I need this process for the retrograde analysis for making engame books
 MSmits: writing to HD is wayyyy too slow
 MSmits: otherwise 15 seeds for oware is the max, with this i can go over 31 and only be limited by calc time
 MSmits: well no not exactly, i also dropped the 200 turn thing, otherwise it would be like 22 seeds
 PatrickMcGinnisII: KiwiTae is making me want to shoot bugs in my house with lasers and tensorflow AI
 MSmits: did you name your cat KiwiTae&#160;? Or otherwise I am missing something
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm making a funny, but I would seriously like to play with his toys to shoot bugs with tho.  Mosquito season and all
 KiwiTae: :joy:
 Chainman: konnichiwa
 MSmits: sounds like something King_Coda's bot would say
 jacek: omae wa mou shindeiru
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Omae wa mou shindeiru¬®
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Anata wa shinitaidesu ka?
 cw477: What are your favorite websites for dev jobs besides glassdoor/dice/indeed?
 ddreams: CG clearly :p
 ddreams: finn.no here in Norway
 cw477: very cool
 AstroHydes: Try any job site but contact the employer directly if you can. Sets you apart from the flood from the website ads.
 AstroHydes: Oof. Replying to old messages.
 ddreams: why the alt?
 AstroHydes: hehe, just the browser I was in 
 AstroHydes: One has one account and the others have the other
 AstroHydes: No other reason
 PatrickMcGinnisII: One is a Byter, be careful
 AstroHydes: Or if you mean the reason *for* the alt, I believe the description is clear
 AstroHydes: hey Patrick
 ddreams: yeah, just wondered if there was some reason for it now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :tumbler_glass:
 AstroHydes: Nah, was listening to some livestream music on youtube and just logged in here for convenience
 AstroHydes: Anyways, will catch up properly later. Things to see and people to do and all that.
 ddreams: Ciao
 SupercraftD: hey guys, do u know if I can somehow download the clash of code image with the like two people fighting with the laptops ylnow?

 Smelty: went from 1200 to 1600 in CoC&#160;:(
 MrFruit: rip
 IlluBlack: Im knew and I would like to know if there's a way to practice the code for a clash of code that I could not make, I did not know  lot of things,, so I studied some concepts and now want to try to solve the same problem, but I don't know where 
 IlluBlack: I'm new*
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: IlluBlack you can use this website to search for all of the clash of code puzzles

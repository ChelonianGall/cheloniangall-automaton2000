 Westicles: Is this true about Groovy:  all Java code with run in Groovy, except it is probably going to be slower?
 Westicles: *will
 Wontonimo: that's not very groovy
 Westicles: It seems to import a bunch of stuff by default so takes longer to run
 star_of_china: it's a little difficult for my to understand the goal in English:sob:
 JustynaBila: Hi!
 Westicles: Ah okay, Groovy is much faster if you use @CompileStatic
 JLukeSkywalker: I hate people that start clash with 2 ppl
 Wontonimo: well, if you are looking to get the achievement of 3 in a row, that's a strategy
 JLukeSkywalker: they didnt solve it
 Wontonimo: well, they aint gonna get 3 in a row with those rookie numbers

 JLukeSkywalker: nice, was just wondering, want to post link to promote
 JLukeSkywalker: try to get some friends to join
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 AntiSquid: it's activity based JLukeSkywalker
 JLukeSkywalker: is it a bug for anyone else where if you are on someone elses profile, you cannot go to yours

 Skynse: man firefox sucks
 Skynse: I've noticed a sharp increase in performance on various website like reddit and codingame using chrome
 BlaiseEbuth: You have to choose wisely: Performance or privacy&#160;? :older_man:
 MasterCoderxD: yo
 jacek: why not both
 reCurse: Privacy in firefox is only a bit better and mostly marketing
 MadKnight: Skynse and chrome has some weird bugs that i'm still waiting to get fixed once they release the beta where it's fixed
 VFDan: firefox has built in tracker blockers while chrome is made by the company that profits the most off ads and tracking
 MadKnight: i really need the feature that they broke long ago and that i'm still waiting to get fixed
 MadKnight: i even found a beta build of chrome to use it
 reCurse: VFDan: They sold the default search engine for $450M/year to Google. Just saying.
 MadKnight: wat
 MadKnight: it didn't make sense i can't understand what he meant
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 help
 Automaton2000: there is a lot of stuff to make it work for you?
 MadKnight: ooooh i read sold as said my bad Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: just make a new account apparently
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i feel like i should
 Automaton2000: i guess i have to have an idea for a bot
 reCurse: Stop spamming thanks
 MadKnight: it made sense when u were discussing big things with smitsy
 MadKnight: but right now... why else does Automaton2000 exist if not to spam him just a bit&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i havent done it yet
 MadKnight: oh wait u meant something a bit diffferent 
 reCurse: What difference is there between a school kid spamming random stuff on the channel and pinging automaton 4 times per minute
 MadKnight: yea i get it now
 MadKnight: i was talking about me just pinging Automaton2000 a few times and not more 
 Automaton2000: i dont think you can
 MadKnight: it just makes it seem like a spam from such a little number of pings
 vagos: guys
 MadKnight: hey x
 vagos: can u shut up
 MadKnight: no
 WocketSesh: hi friends
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 help me out come up with a joke here
 Automaton2000: i'm just wondering if anyone could help me out with a good bot
 WocketSesh: :rage:
 MadKnight: everything i come up with is just dumb, Automaton2000 i need something better
 Automaton2000: let me see if i can manage to do the first move is not to play
 SPDene: Automaton2000 You realise MadKnight is a bot, right?
 Automaton2000: i was at the bottom left
 MadKnight: SPDene u realise the world is flat, right&#160;?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 stop chilling in acorner of the world
 Automaton2000: in case you don't know how much time did it take you to make a chat
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 it was a dumb joke again cmon
 Automaton2000: so the game is symmetric
 AntiSquid: stop spamming when chat is dead!!!
 AntiSquid:  /s
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 how's it going
 Automaton2000: might be good to start
 karliso: Automaton2000 What do you do to get yourself motivated?
 Automaton2000: and it can be done in python
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: .
 AntiSquid: hi, no new innovative username? or is this now your favourite?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: &gt;_&gt;
 AntiSquid: just asking&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: how's it going? 
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Did I miss... another contest?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Good
 AntiSquid: no idea, heard there was a contest for french only
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: lol
 Wontonimo: yeah there was, it was a codebusters clone
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: oh...
 AntiSquid: you can try Xprize contest if you feel creative
 AntiSquid: and save the planet too :o
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: xprize?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.xprize.org/">https://www.xprize.org/</a>
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: interesting...
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 stop spamming Automaton2000 cmon
 Automaton2000: are you asking me if i will try to make it to bronze with this
 Wontonimo: in UTTT, if both players win the same number of smaller boards, is it a draw or does player 2 get the win?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 cmon dude
 Automaton2000: it depends what you want to read about
 jrke: Automaton2000 do you know AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: error "print(" ") and it will be the same as the rest of the code in any language
 Automaton2000: if you had to add a lot of time on that puzzle
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Wh-
 jrke: MaliciouslyCrypticUsername automaton2000 and automatonNN are chatbots so they just throw random sentence just have fun with them
 Automaton2000: i will get the same number of turns in a game
 AutomatonNN: I know you can have a coding contest and we are a bit sure they are all hard anymore
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: jrke I know
 jrke: oh i thought you don't, sorry
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: &gt;,&lt;
 JohnathanBarbee: That moment when you can't tell if your bot isn't optimized enough to complete one turn without timing out or if your code has a bug.
 JohnathanBarbee: I call it The Low-Gold Blues

 JohnathanBarbee: It should be
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyI635o2pmk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyI635o2pmk</a> nvm different title

 DensetsuOne: I`m Imba
 JLukeSkywalker: there is a 0.002% chance me submitting bulls and cows 2 will get 100%
 JLukeSkywalker: do i smap submit?
 JLukeSkywalker: spam*
 jacek: smap indeed
 JLukeSkywalker: there is a non-zero chance it gets me first place
 JLukeSkywalker: this is a good plan
 struct: how is it not 0?
 JLukeSkywalker: randomly guessing number, with some pruning of the possible guesses
 JLukeSkywalker: could theoretically get it first try for every validator
 darkhorse64: try heavy pruning and get always 100%
 JLukeSkywalker: ^^just need to think how to prune better, will eventually
 HunterEhrenfeld: clash of code is the best thing ever
 JLukeSkywalker: currently my pruning gets me up to 5 digits with 300 guesses
 JLukeSkywalker: rest are chance
 RoboStac: JLukeSkywalker - it's impossible to guess first try, the number is generated afterwards based on your guess (to have a set number of bulls / cows per validator)
 JLukeSkywalker: ah, guess that would be 2 guesses for each then
 struct: JLukeSkywalker im not sure how easy is to code a decent ai for pool
 JLukeSkywalker: neither am i
 struct: Might be simple to make  a good ai
 JLukeSkywalker: thats partially y i asked
 JLukeSkywalker: if its super easy, not great for a multi on here
 JLukeSkywalker: i figure with the time limitations though, might be hard enough to make it competetive
 struct: I dont think its hard to pocket always the next ball
 JLukeSkywalker: i did not think about the pocket = shoot again
 JLukeSkywalker: could do something like just 1 shot per turn maybe
 JLukeSkywalker: i think that would force you to look for chains of pockets
 struct: it should be 1 shot per turn ofc
 struct: But I dont think there will be any trouble always pocketing one ball
 JLukeSkywalker: you can pocket more than one
 JLukeSkywalker: so the better bots would be looking for that
 struct: You mean multiple in 1 turn?
 Wontonimo: if you want an example of how not to code an AI for pool, watch codebullet&#160;!  man, that guy is funny
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, you could theoretically win within a couple turns
 JLukeSkywalker: just insane math
 JLukeSkywalker: that most definitely cant be completed in the time limits on here
 Wontonimo: are you looking for 1 shot to sink everything, or sink 1 ball per shot?  The second is simple trig
 JLukeSkywalker: it would be a game of pool
 JLukeSkywalker: the goal is to win
 JLukeSkywalker: so yes, you could sink 1 ball per shot
 Wontonimo: okay, so regular rules.  And is the shot 100% accurate?
 JLukeSkywalker: you would give angle to hit and power
 Wontonimo: ah, so 100% accurate.
 struct: I would be surpised if a game would last longer than 15 turns with strong bots playing
 Wontonimo: ^
 Westicles: with spin and chaotic breaks?
 Wontonimo: even medium bots
 Wontonimo: add spin, that would be nice.
 struct: make it 3d
 Wontonimo: but still, i'd say add something like 1% error on both angle and power
 Wontonimo: that way, it is important for you to take shots that are close, and for you to set up for your next shot
 Wontonimo: just like actual pool players do
 Westicles: You have to be mentally prepared to do a bunch of work and only 15 play it the first month
 Westicles: people
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, i get that part lol
 JLukeSkywalker: would be ok with that
 Astrobytes: Quality &gt; quantity
 JLukeSkywalker: i just enjoy the making process almost better than the coding/competing
 struct: I thought about porting it before
 struct: But discarded it
 struct: Also when you rack the balls
 struct: Dont put them always on same place and distance
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, isnt there an actual pool variant for that?
 Astrobytes: I thiiiink so
 Astrobytes: Damned if I know the name
 JLukeSkywalker: i'll find it if i go forward
 Astrobytes: I think it's a decent idea
 Astrobytes: (btw)
 Westicles: I made a contrib about baseball.  Apparently nobody knows anything about baseball anymore
 JLukeSkywalker: whats baseball?
 Astrobytes: Outside the US, not many do
 struct: I only know a little about it
 Astrobytes: Kind of a niche thing outside of the US, same with NFL
 Wontonimo: also police chase simulators
 JLukeSkywalker: thinking about it, if it was a worldwide thing, a full baseball multi would be pretty cool
 JLukeSkywalker: multi-agent, with a bunch more coll things added
 Astrobytes: Think that would be too much for CG tbh
 JZX: bruh I'm so confused
 JLukeSkywalker: i think it would just depend on how you did the pitching/hitting
 JLukeSkywalker: i think it might be pretty doable 2d
 Astrobytes: Hey don't let me pee on your chips, do feel free to give it a shot. I'd like to be proved wrong!
 MSmits: Brits have weird hobbies
 BlaiseEbuth: You're wrong Astrobytes.
 Astrobytes: They do?
 MSmits: pee on chips?
 Westicles: Spotted dick and pee on your chips
 MSmits: wait maybe i cant call a scot a brit
 Astrobytes: The correct phrase is p*ss on your chips, it's like 'rain on your parade'
 MSmits: scots have weird hobbies :P
 BlaiseEbuth: And food
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: :rofl: that's not proof though
 Astrobytes: Says Blaise coming from the land of tripes
 BlaiseEbuth: It is: I say it.
 Astrobytes: :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Tripes... I think there's strange minorities in every country...
 Astrobytes: Hey I used to love tripes (and haggis)
 BlaiseEbuth: That's what I said.
 Astrobytes: Yeah yeah
 Westicles: And pork rinds with the hairs still in them?
 Westicles: scratchings I guess
 Astrobytes: That's an English thing. I don't like pork cracklings
 Astrobytes: Yeah, scratchings, that's the one
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes prefer hunting haggis in the Hgihlands.
 Astrobytes: Other than that, I used to eat most animals nose to tail 
 BlaiseEbuth: I gonna hunt some pizzas..
 Astrobytes: Yes BlaiseEbuth: you know they only have 3 legs. They have wings but can only go a short distance, like chickens.
 Astrobytes: (Haggii, not pizzas)
 MSmits: huh
 Westicles: sounds like a bible book.  haggai
 MSmits: i was afk and now we're talking about fantasy creatures
 MSmits: do i need to stay here to keep things sane
 Astrobytes: lol Westicles
 MadKnight: gosh Automaton2000
 Astrobytes: You derailed everything in the first place MSmits!
 MadKnight: stop doing that Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you'll get the same result
 Automaton2000: are u asking for help
 MSmits: hmm I guess so
 Astrobytes: We were talking about a potential baseball multi prior to that :P
 MadKnight: i didn't even understand what he meant
 Astrobytes: Me or Smits?
 Katsuro78: S
 Astrobytes: But physics!
 Astrobytes: Also pool was suggested.
 MSmits: meh
 MSmits: swimming pool?
 Astrobytes: billiards!
 MSmits: o
 MSmits: i guess that one is better
 MSmits: I am guessing struct already has a version lined up
 Astrobytes: Swimming would be... intriguing
 JLukeSkywalker: water polo
 Astrobytes: Not struct, JLukeSkywalker
 Astrobytes: @MSmits
 MSmits: are you 100% sure struct doesnt also have one
 struct: I discarded the ide
 Astrobytes: He had one but threw it away
 struct: idea*
 MSmits: aha
 Astrobytes: trictrac: Touché&#160;:)
 MSmits: huh
 MSmits: do we have an invisible tric in the chat
 Astrobytes: He caught up with my Clobber bot
 MSmits: oh
 Astrobytes: And I saw he was online
 MSmits: well you know he would 
 MSmits: knew
 Astrobytes: Ofc, I was waiting for it eagerly!
 trictrac: hello Astrobytes &amp; MSmits
 MSmits: hi trictrac
 Astrobytes: hello
 MSmits: i am still hooked to uttt or i would join you in clobber
 Astrobytes: And clobber us no doubt.
 trictrac: good bot @ clobber astro&#160;!
 Astrobytes: thank you trictrac, your new one is also good. Gives me something to work on&#160;:)
 MSmits: got bitboard yet?
 MadKnight: astobytes i think i get it now so i can't tell what was the thing that was it about
 Astrobytes: Nope. I haven't touched anything today, was busy
 trictrac: yes of course bitbording is life
 MSmits: agreed
 Astrobytes: trictrac: Mines isn't bitboarded yet&#160;:)
 JLukeSkywalker: whats the most accurate way to get time in python on here?
 MSmits: dont know about accurate, but if you need to do anything with python and are worried about time, you may not be using the right language&#160;:)
 MSmits: i would just import time, but i have never been inthe position to be time limited with python
 JLukeSkywalker: shh, it will be fine, i just want the 2 extra loops in python. dont need the couple hundred i could get in c++
 MSmits: C# works fine too
 Astrobytes: Eh, it's python - " import most_accurate_way_ to_get_time"
 MSmits: nice naming style
 JZX: man coding is too hard I'll never become a programmer Imma give up now&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Well you'll never become anything with that attitude.
 MSmits: sure you will
 MSmits: a quitter
 JZX: ik but still
 JZX: I'm just so lost
 MSmits: start with something simple
 Astrobytes: Maybe you should spend time off CG just practising really basic stuff until it's literally a part of you
 MSmits: just start coding stuff in a python-friendly environment
 JZX: Idk how to build towards the harder stuff
 LazyMammal: in python, `time.monotonic()` works very well.
 JLukeSkywalker: that needs *1000 to get to ms right?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://repl.it/">https://repl.it/</a>  click on start coding, make  apython3  repl and just experiment
 MSmits: print stuff
 MSmits: try input
 JZX: I'm starting with C# because I want to be a game dev
 Astrobytes: ^ follow some tutorials etc
 Westicles: Isn't programming one of the first jobs the AIs will take over?  Like for real
 JZX: would you recomend c#?
 MSmits: yeah i would
 JZX: hm alr
 MSmits: I learned to code with C#
 murrayr: programming is the last job AIs take over - after that there are no jobs&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: Over python? Yes
 MSmits: C# is compiled, which is the only disadvantage compared to python when starting out. 
 JZX: I took a 4-hour tutorial and I still don't really understand the basics. I just really don't know how to improve
 JZX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQdlIFylQ8&amp;t=4298s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQdlIFylQ8&amp;t=4298s</a>
 JZX: Is the one I'm talking about
 MSmits: more tutorials, different sources will have different approaches. You will start to recognize things then
 MSmits: try watch people solve puzzles with it
 JZX: hm alr
 JZX: thanks for the help
 MSmits: any time
 LazyMammal: @JLukeSkywalker time.monotonic_ns() and time.monotonic() both exist.
 Wontonimo: MSmits - i finally got the __builtin_ia32_pdep_si intrinsic to compile locally (thank for that!) and went from about 25k playouts to 36k playouts in uttt.  THANKS!
 MSmits: hey is that just _pdep_u32&#160;?
 Wontonimo: yeah, it is
 MSmits: what language are you using?
 Wontonimo: c++
 MSmits: I just type _pdep_u32
 Wontonimo: for some reason my mac don't like that 
 MSmits: ohh
 Wontonimo: or i just didn't type it right
 MSmits: yeah there are many things my VS doesnt like either
 Wontonimo: or i'm dumb ...
 MSmits: do you use it for selecting random moves?
 Wontonimo: yes
 MSmits: i dont quite remember telling you about pdep, but i told a lot of people. Was it astrobytes that told you?
 Wontonimo: it was taking 21% of all cpu time before, and now it is way less
 MSmits: or maybe i just have not been sleeping enough
 Wontonimo: oh, maybe you sent me the fast sqrt
 Astrobytes: Wasn't me, unless my memory fails me
 MSmits: i did send you the sqrt yes
 Astrobytes: perhaps darkhorse
 MSmits: yeah he uses that too
 Wontonimo: thanks all around 
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: most of what I tell you I have learned from others on this same chat
 MSmits: my uttt bot still has remnants of Robo-wisdom
 MSmits: even after many rewrites
 Wontonimo: i haven't implemented the fast sqrt yet.  from my instrumentation it isn't my current bottleneck
 MSmits: yeah it probably isnt
 MSmits: the reason i had to use it is because i really wanted to get rid of my sqrt cache
 MSmits: precalculated 1 million inverse sqrts in the first second
 MSmits: and then i could not go over 1 million visits per node or get a seg fault :P
 Wontonimo: ah, easy fix there is to use max(value, 1million)
 Wontonimo: lol
 MSmits: then you have a condition on every sqrt
 Wontonimo: yeah, i know, it's not good.  joke
 MSmits: it would be a fix, because then it would be so slow, every option would be better
 MSmits: hehe ok
 MSmits: i just capped the search
 MSmits: to 1 million root visits
 MSmits: it still is my fastest UCT implementation&#160;:(
 MSmits: but not using it
 darkhorse64: re mac not liking pdep, you should check whether your CPU support the instruction
 MSmits: well he got the other one to work
 MSmits: it's also pdep so..
 MSmits: or do you think it's  a wrapper that switches to a slower version when unsupported?
 darkhorse64: My previous pc did not support it. So I had to emulate it
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: that must have been super slow
 darkhorse64: not that much but of course any profiling attempt was doomed to fail
 MSmits: right
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/265f1701-07b9-43fa-b7b5-d02c4531e623">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/265f1701-07b9-43fa-b7b5-d02c4531e623</a>
 Wontonimo: ^ darkhorse64
 Wontonimo: looks like it is supproted
 darkhorse64: OK. I am clueless then
 Wontonimo: you know how i said i may be dumb?  well, it turns out in my effort to get it to work, that was one change i made then later I put the pragma GCC in the right place with the right parameters, but never switched _pdep_u32 back.  just checked, it works
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MSmits: cool!
 Wontonimo: now my bottleneck is doing backprop which is taking 77% of my CPU.
 jacek: how deep you can go
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 Wontonimo: all the way?
 jacek: what is your bot typical depth
 Wontonimo: oh, till a win or tie
 Wontonimo: MCTS
 jacek: i meant your selection tree
 Wontonimo: oh, ah... i don't know... i could debug that
 Wontonimo: is it important?
 jacek: just curious
 jacek: well, deeper tree, the selection will be more bottleneck
 jacek: and backprop
 Wontonimo: yeah... right.  i don't prune the parent away atm.
 Wontonimo: hmm, is adding doubles slow?  seems like it would be
 jacek: dont use doubles anywhere. floats are sufficient
 jacek: though i doubt they could be that much of the bottleneck
 Wontonimo: actually, just  counted playouts / 1 sec and doubles make 8% more playouts in the same time
 Wontonimo: weird ... really weird
 Astrobytes: How many times did you test that
 Wontonimo: 4 times each
 Astrobytes: locally or on CG?
 Wontonimo: that's a lie.  4 times using float, and 3 times using double.  locally
 MSmits: you'll have larger nodes with doubles 
 MSmits: harder to reuse tree
 MSmits: but also it should be slower
 Wontonimo: i'm at 80th!  brb
 MSmits: but we already established you have a weird cpu :P
 Wontonimo: ha ...
 Wontonimo: at least something weird between the cpu and the chair
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 struct: what cpu do you have?
 Wontonimo: 2.2 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7
 Wontonimo: so, reasonable
 jacek: 6 cores? what year is it? 2020?
 Wontonimo: it's a laptop
 struct: which compiler are you using?
 Wontonimo: here's the command i useg++ -std=c++17 -stdlib=libc++ -lm -lpthread -ldl -march=native speed_test.cpp
 struct: you use any pragmas in speed_test?
 Wontonimo: #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast", "inline", "omit-frame-pointer", "unroll-loops")
 Wontonimo: ^ i have no idea what that does
 Wontonimo: one of you kind souls sent it to me
 struct: Its weird
 struct: Never in any of my multis did double perform better than float
 Wontonimo: the real test will be on CG.  Maybe I was doing something in the background locally curing the float test
 JLukeSkywalker: ok, now i have to do it in python, got my bulls and cows 2 up to length 8
 JLukeSkywalker: 9 and 10 still timeout
 Wontonimo: what's bulls and cows?  link plz

 JLukeSkywalker: only 80 people have solved it
 Wontonimo: 50ms per turn ... and i'm guessing a 1000ms on the first turn.
 TBali: off-topic:: Nasa rover is due to land in 15 mins. Live on NASA TV. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2021/02/18/mars-2020-landing-mission-status-center/">https://spaceflightnow.com/2021/02/18/mars-2020-landing-mission-status-center/</a> 
 JLukeSkywalker: idk what the first turn is, but its enough for me to generate 10p10 permutations
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, editor changed again
 Wontonimo: only a few minutes till atm entry. Thanks TBali
 Wontonimo: it is 20 min delayed do to SPACE IS HUGE
 TBali: touchdown is 410sec from atm entry, radio travel time 11min, so its fate is already decided, we just don't know it yet.
 Wontonimo: oh, 11min.  my bad
 jacek: discussing mars lander puzzle eh
 jacek: i bet those noobs even didnt solve that puzzle
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pfft., they needed a parachute
 TBali: touchdown!  much better then my mars lander code!
 Wontonimo: did they use a GA?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: last 7 minutes:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.flnerd.com/Nasa/2021-02-18%2015-49-39.mp4">http://www.flnerd.com/Nasa/2021-02-18%2015-49-39.mp4</a>
 TBali: "Terrain Relative Navigation" must have included some advanced AI.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they said it had to 'find' landing solution
 PatrickMcGinnisII: GA would take too long
 struct: thrust = rand()&#160;% 200;
 struct: angle = -18 + rand()&#160;% 36;
 Astrobytes: depth 1 flat MC
 PatrickMcGinnisII: prolly a trits matrix heuristic eval, they used PHP...;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: j/k
 TBali: The radiation-hardened computers they use are more likely much slower than state-of-art regular CPUs, but probably a bit more capably than what Viking 1 had
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what would be interesting is if they used parallel computing, I would ... threads be damned
 TBali: Viking computer system (launched 46y ago): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch5-6.html">https://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch5-6.html</a>

 TBali: But this is for the rover, not the landing guidance.
 TBali: PowerPC 750 at 200 MHz. Hmm.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: viking was less tham 1MHZ
 PatrickMcGinnisII: an arduino could have done it
 TBali: or the arduino would have been dead because of radiation in 6 months of deep space
 Astrobytes: Nah, they called it an Arduino because it's 'ard as nails...
 TBali: I don't know what OS they use? some real-time OS? or some Unix variant?
 TBali: I mean Mars2020, not the Viking...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: prolly Mint
 TBali: Let's listen to some Irish Rovers...&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: It only sailed 7 years before the measles broke out though
 PatrickMcGinnisII: talking to Automaton2000 may be more fun
 Automaton2000: and the enemy has no way to determine if i can do it in 1 day
 BlaiseEbuth: :imp:
 Astrobytes: Didn't the UAE and the Chinese already get to Mars first this month?
 Astrobytes: *or not and
 TBali: ...then the ship struck a rock... maybe the song refers to Mars?
 Astrobytes: Oh lord what a shock! Possibly
 TBali: ...poor old dog was drowned...
 BlaiseEbuth: I'M THE LAST OF THE IRISH ROVER&#160;!
 TBali: This is an ancient lakebed we talk about, but I still find it unlikely
 Astrobytes: I'm the last of the Irish Roooover
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 TBali: That is already 2
 Astrobytes: The dog didn't drown after all
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My first concert was the Irish Rovers...I was like 7 years old...so....43 years ago....wtf
 TBali: Is The Dubliners still active? They were already ancient when I had my CD
 BlaiseEbuth: The singer is dead&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I saw them at Royal Albert Hall in London a few days before Barney died
 TBali:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Shadow of their former selves of course but it was a nice tribute, lots of stories and stuff.
 Astrobytes: If Luke Kelly had been with them through the years... my that would've been something
 TBali: I had a concert CD - also lot's of stories between songs - too bad I undersstood only half of it. But the  arranged folk songs and their enthusiastic play are great
 Astrobytes: Though Ronnie Drew did a fine job singing.Yeah, they were an excellent band.
 Astrobytes: I enjoyed the Pogues take on Irish music too. Great energy and songwriting.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, we're doing that musical chat takeover thing again
 BlaiseEbuth: You're a traitor to your land.
 BlaiseEbuth: Listening irish things...
 Astrobytes: Me? lol almost half my family came from Ireland. Just some from the North and not enough for me to get an Irish passport.
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 Astrobytes: Lots of us lowlanders are descended from Irish
 BlaiseEbuth: You don't deserve your kilt.
 Astrobytes: I don't have a kilt. Got a banjo though.
 BlaiseEbuth: Scotland is not what she was anymore...&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: What? A mix of wildmen, Norse and Celts?
 Astrobytes: I think we're still the same!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: evolve plz,  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aghHKg65zaM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aghHKg65zaM</a>
 Astrobytes: Folk/Viking metal
 TBali: was the first 30 sec nice&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: inb4 someone posts some pirate metal
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think it's pagan german metal, but it's a celtic tune
 Astrobytes: ^yeah - folk
 TBali: "pagan metal "- then it must be copper or bronze
 dawici: does the escape game use a different login than the main website? I can't seem to use the same login info
 Astrobytes: Not awful, I like my metal a bit more brutal mostly 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: anything with a dragon cover&#160;::thumbs up::
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 TBali: yes you need to register separately
 BlaiseEbuth: There is bunch of cool "something metal".
 dawici: shoot, I was hoping to get results on my main account
 TBali: dawici
 dawici: thanks for the help
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's separate, for now at least
 TBali: symphonic metal is ok
 TBali: but trash metal is beyond my comfort zone
 Astrobytes: My only actual dev job we had a contractor called Mike who *relentlessly* listened to 'Symphonic Black Metal'
 Astrobytes: *In my
 Astrobytes: I was heavily into punk, hardcore, thrash at that point
 Astrobytes: (not exclusively ofc)
 BlaiseEbuth: Belzebub is cool
 TBali: Tarja Turunen, Sabaton, Stratovarius
 TBali: Sabaton had a concert in Budapest  last February 1month before lockdown. I think that was my last such programme ever since.
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't think sabaton is symphonic black metal :thinking:
 TBali: No, but still good
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 TBali: I am not expert on categoies, maybe power metal?
 Astrobytes: Who cares, we're just talking about metal
 Astrobytes: I've always been a massive Opeth fan, even now that they're not 'metal' any more
 PatrickMcGinnisII: last concert i went to was Avatar opening up for Trivium ... had tickets to festival featuring Rob Zombie, but it was cancelled... CoV BS ... suing for my $800 back
 Astrobytes: God I hate Trivium. Nothing against the guys, they can play, but eghhh
 TBali: $800 for a ticket? OMG...
 TBali: was it WC final?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah, 400 VIP....GF loves metal too
 Astrobytes: Was that with or without the sex swing option?
 Astrobytes: :P
 BlaiseEbuth: I have my tickets for the Graspop... Not cancelled yet, will see...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and yes, a 50 yr. old English teacher that knows how to 'get-down'...I'm a lucky man
 TBali: "tickets are valid for an online replacement event. Thank you for your understanding.&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: Kink is ageless PatrickMcGinnisII
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: Ever do Hellfest?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I had to sue to get my $ back,  won't go to court til 1 year after event was to take place.  Promoter is an asshole.
 BlaiseEbuth: Na. Graspop has the same line-up and takes place at the same time. Groups just switch between both. Byt graspop is closer to my home ^^
 Astrobytes: Ah gotcha
 Astrobytes: That sucks PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Molly Hatchet did come to town ... but two of them live here
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Not much metal venues near me, all rap or country
 Astrobytes: Ain't they just rocky blues stuff?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I wanna go to germany
 Astrobytes: 'Southern' rock
 PatrickMcGinnisII: s-rock yes, but they like classic rock at this point
 Astrobytes: I dig southern too
 Astrobytes: Allman bros etc etc. Lots of American roots music is cool. Even the Dead
 Astrobytes: Germany-wise, I've missed Rammstein like 4 times in the past decade
 PatrickMcGinnisII: CoV has shut everything down, depressing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I made my GF reup her passport...jusy to go nowhere
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 BlaiseEbuth: That's why I have no GF
 Astrobytes: ^
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, trying to figure out this tiling by squares.
 BlaiseEbuth: nor passport
 TBali: Nice CD cover<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K_-D5B7DIg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K_-D5B7DIg</a>

 Astrobytes: You didn't do it yet Patrick?
 Astrobytes: I thought you had it figured out after discovering the formulae the other day
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that waas different puzzle, yea i did that one
 Astrobytes: Ohh right that was the bricks? OR steps or something
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 1x2 bricks i think
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i've doen more since then
 PatrickMcGinnisII: done
 Astrobytes: Was gonna say, you're normally faster than that&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Was wasting time with shadows of the knight ep2 for a couple days
 TBali: "TILING BY SQUARES" is also on my todo list. Gave it some thought already but still don't have the necessary idea.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think it's a minimum path length kinda thing.  my first try at it today misses edge cases...gotta rethink it
 Astrobytes: DP + minimum path length I think yeah, not my kinda thing but looks interesting
 TBali: DP for sure as the rectangle gets smaller if I put a square in it, but the resulting shape can get tricky.
 TBali: I still need a solution for L shape.
 TBali: I do it for w == h, you do the rest&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: I'm not doing this at all right now, though I did bookmark it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: "Goro Want Chocolatewas alot easier
 BlaiseEbuth: Speaking of metal, here's my contribution to the musical chat. (Must be listened AND watched) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APK2iGKK7gs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APK2iGKK7gs</a> :3
 TBali: Goro was very simple DP, I solved it 
 TBali: BlaiseEbuth lol - I didn't know even the original one, had to look up.
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 TBali: Not an expert in contemporary Indian music...
 BlaiseEbuth: Me neither, but the original was a real buzz few years ago.
 TBali: 166M views for the original.

 Astrobytes: Egg-opening + facehugging alien or gtfo
 BlaiseEbuth: Especially to welcome Musk...
 Astrobytes: hahaha, not wrong
 dwarfie: BlaiseEbuth ... still pessimist ... :D

 Astrobytes: Hey, pessimism is a way of life! You're never disappointed if you expect the worst!
 TBali: But that was Spirit/Opportunity times
 Astrobytes: Tbali: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm not. I'm really optimist about some demons eating Musk.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wait til starlink is fully operational, i want to tell my IP to stick it
 TBali: 100 usd per month?  that business case will not hold, only for very limited use cases
 Astrobytes: Hopefully there's an alien called an Elon and he just happens to smell like it.
 Astrobytes: Other than that, the only hope is someone microdosing him with novichok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well my cable won't bring fiber optic, they have a monopoly ... i prefer fiber - but they won't do it
 TBali: how much speed do you get without it?
 Astrobytes: Starlink eh, Elon with his own private network eh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i get 300 down and maybe 30 up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: on a good day
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for $75/mo.
 TBali: here I think I have 300Mbps, did not opt for 500 or 1000 as I don't ffind current one too slow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's as fast as they can go
 TBali: but I pay 25 $ for net+tv+phone
 PatrickMcGinnisII: shoulda had T1 speeds by now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well u lucky... they crooks here
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i meant 1000
 TBali: I am using IP-over-powerwire within the flat. Did not want to recable
 TBali: so this room it is only 120 Mbps
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my wireless only gets 100M, wired i get 3xmore...stupid router
 VFDan: here i get 100mbps/100mbps
 TBali: Funny thing writing to a pendrive is now slower than download
 TBali: it became as obsolete as CD-RW or floppy disk  before 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: usb is slow,  ssd is about 500Mbps ... that's all i really want
 TBali: I think ssd is faster than that. I have traditional hdd in the nas and I can write it with continously at 500 Mbps over Ethernet.
 struct: depends on the ssd
 TBali: b is bit in all above
 TBali: not byte
 struct: ah right
 TBali: (we started with telco stuff the conversation)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, most hdd is like 128mbps, and i had slow down...upgraded to ssds and no issues since they faster than internet speed
 CosmicStudios: Does Codingame let  you use C#
 PatrickMcGinnisII: doubled memory prevents bufferring as well, ahh i should shut up
 struct: yes
 struct: cosmic
 CosmicStudios: thanks
 CosmicStudios: I'm doing clash of code for whoever wants to join
 PatrickMcGinnisII: went back to base code on tiling
 TBali: Space probe 'New Horizons' had 1 kbps at Pluto's distance, so we can stop complaining about net speed.&#160;:-)

 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm doing it wrong
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh god, back to birds
 TBali: Patrick I don't understand your code fully.
 TBali: But it seems to have too much } no?
 TBali: Do you use a class with static members for memoization? just to avoid using "global"?
 Astrobytes: gawd will you just use C or something, at least it'll be readable :P
 TBali: con::sqval  might miss a $
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes i fixed that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes for memoisation the class with statics
 CosmicStudios: pop quiz who wants money
 CosmicStudios: I assotiated a challenge with mr beast and and... yeah forget it I suck at lying
 TBali: otherwise the code seems legit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i had just deleted a bunch of stuff, so yea it was wrong
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm wondering if therre's a pascal triangle like way of building up the answer
 JLukeSkywalker: is there a fast way to shuffle big things in pyhton?
 JLukeSkywalker: i want random indexes, but its a lot faster to shuffle beforehand and just pop things
 JLukeSkywalker: however big lists random.shuffle doesnt finish withing the first turn time
 JLukeSkywalker: from my testing it looks like numpy.random.shuffle might be the fastest
 JLukeSkywalker: but still not fast enough
 TrippTrapp84: Anyone attempting the ANEO puzzle?
 JLukeSkywalker: i did it
 JLukeSkywalker: @TrippTrapp84
 TrippTrapp84: Nice. did you have any issues regarding floating point errors?
 JLukeSkywalker: i didnt use any ints until the final print, but other than that, no
 JLukeSkywalker: i used python
 TrippTrapp84: Ah
 TrippTrapp84: Did you do manual checks or did you work out a formula for it
 JLukeSkywalker: looks like i used a while loop
 TrippTrapp84: Mhmm
 TrippTrapp84: Dang
 TrippTrapp84: I don't know if I can salvage my equation approach
 JLukeSkywalker: while not checkLights(speed,lights):
 JLukeSkywalker: that worked for me
 TrippTrapp84: I came up with ((LightDist/Speed) // LightDuration) MOD 2 == 0 to determine if the light was green at that speed
 TrippTrapp84: I'm using Lua
 JLukeSkywalker: looks like i used that also
 TrippTrapp84: It works fine except the conversion factor for the speed means the LightDist/Speed part can be slightly lower than it should be, which results in the // LightDuration returning one lower than it should.
 JLukeSkywalker: does the int divide happen before or after the other one?
 TrippTrapp84: after
 TrippTrapp84: I tried to be explicit with the parentheses
 JLukeSkywalker: if int(light[0]/speed/light[1])%2==1:
 JLukeSkywalker: this is what i used to check
 JLukeSkywalker: looks the same as yours
 JLukeSkywalker: are your units the same?
 TrippTrapp84: I did all mine in m/s
 TrippTrapp84: The conversion factor for the speed is 1/3.6
 JLukeSkywalker: yep
 TrippTrapp84: But multiplying the speed by 1/3.6 gives me a number slightly higher than it should be for the speed
 JLukeSkywalker: why are you multiplying by 1/3.6?
 TrippTrapp84: specifically the 1 issue I looked at that is causing me problems was 50/3, which is 16.666 repeating
 TrippTrapp84: Because speed was in km/h
 TrippTrapp84: multiplying speed by 1/3.6 should convert that to m/s
 JLukeSkywalker: sry, i did this a while ago
 JLukeSkywalker: speed = int(input())/3.6
 JLukeSkywalker: i took in the speed like this
 TrippTrapp84: Yeah. that looks the same as mine
 JLukeSkywalker: maybe lua just sucks?
 TrippTrapp84: idfk man
 TrippTrapp84: idk man
 TrippTrapp84: Weird lag
 TrippTrapp84: but yeah, maybe lua has no representation of a double
 TrippTrapp84: I think python does right?
 JLukeSkywalker: can you post your code?
 TrippTrapp84: It's a little lengthy, should I put it in a pastebin?
 JLukeSkywalker: it does it for you
 TrippTrapp84: Ah mk
 TrippTrapp84: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1e82b2c0-e8b6-4376-8dde-8a73558b88d5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1e82b2c0-e8b6-4376-8dde-8a73558b88d5</a>
 TrippTrapp84: specifically in the bottom for loop
 TrippTrapp84: Where I calculate RealSpeed and LightIndex
 TrippTrapp84: the if speed&lt;70 statement is for debugging purposes
 TrippTrapp84: You can ignore that
 JLukeSkywalker: looks like your loop breaks if the first light is valid?
 TrippTrapp84: No, invalid
 JLukeSkywalker: didnt see the ~
 TrippTrapp84: If it finds an invalid light it breaks
 TrippTrapp84: yeah Lua Not equal is weird
 TrippTrapp84: dunno why they can't just use&#160;!= like everyone else
 JLukeSkywalker: i think i had mine set up like that originally and it didnt work
 JLukeSkywalker: i looped with speed as m/s
 JLukeSkywalker: then converted to km/h for the print
 TrippTrapp84: Maybe I should try converting the distance to km?
 TrippTrapp84: And the duration to hours?
 JLukeSkywalker: i kept those as is, i converted speed before the loop, then after
 JLukeSkywalker: so instead of -1, my decriment was by 1/3.6
 TrippTrapp84: Ahhhh, I see
 TrippTrapp84: Let me try that then
 JLukeSkywalker: oh, and then i didnt convert speed to int, I rounded it to int
 JLukeSkywalker: at the end
 TrippTrapp84: Yeah, to account for the floating point issues I'd assume
 JLukeSkywalker: dont remember why
 TrippTrapp84: Probably because it could be slightly above or below the number
 TrippTrapp84: And rounding was basically a guarantee
 TrippTrapp84: well whadya know
 TrippTrapp84: That actually worked
 TrippTrapp84: Damn if I know how it worked
 TrippTrapp84: But sure
 JLukeSkywalker: lol
 MadKnight: oh lua looks kinda weird
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, i dont like it
 TrippTrapp84: It's tables are better though
 JLukeSkywalker: that was the first time i read it in like 4 years
 TrippTrapp84: We don't have out od bounds exceptions
 TrippTrapp84: of*
 MadKnight: hey i'm new here
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 help me
 Automaton2000: how do u do that for the past 2 days
 TrippTrapp84: do what
 MadKnight: u can't do that for the past days Automaton2000 cmon
 Automaton2000: how can you tell me how to do that?
 MadKnight: there's no way i can be telling u how u can be doing stuff Automaton2000 what are u even talking about
 Automaton2000: i think im gonna do
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wth
 JLukeSkywalker:&#160;?
 MadKnight: oh hey PatrickMcGinnisII
 MadKnight: don't worry
 MadKnight:  we're just being context-'ish
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm getting verification errors
 MadKnight: oh where?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Play testcase ... taking too long
 MadKnight:  wat
 MadKnight: why?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: using wrong browser i guess
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2000 and MK's fault
 Automaton2000: well it's not really a problem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: server slow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gotta eat, glhf
 MadKnight: then just stop using the wrong browser
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 they always say it's my fault
 Automaton2000: are you a bot&#160;?
 MadKnight: even when i spam Automaton2000 they say it's my fault
 MadKnight: can u imagine that Automaton2000&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: is anyone not a bot?
 Automaton2000: has been banned by madknight.
 Automaton2000: i was thinking more like this: if there is more than enough
 MadKnight: JLukeSkywalker that was your response
 MadKnight: and it was just perfect
 MadKnight: i mean if it put your name in the beginnnign
 MadKnight: -ing
 MadKnight: but seriously
 MadKnight: JLukeSkywalker what's your point?&gt;
 JLukeSkywalker: i dont have one, im round
 MadKnight: u gotta have a center point if u are round cmon
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 let's fix JLukeSkywalker
 Automaton2000: now i'm really curious to see how that is possible
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 are u round
 Automaton2000: no, i'm not a very good site to learn
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 u a
 Automaton2000: they are in the same position
 MadKnight: u are not a very good circle for people to learn circles Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: the problem is i don't know why it's not a good move
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 being a circle is truly not a good move
 Automaton2000: i played a lot of my bots
 MadKnight: stop playing your bots Automaton2000 u are a bot on your own
 Automaton2000: is there a limit to the number of the fibonnacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on). as ...
 MadKnight: yes Automaton2000 it's 42
 Automaton2000: i'll keep that in mind if i use the same thing :p
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 what do u mean? are u not using 42? wat
 Automaton2000: i am a noob when it comes to performance
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 stop not using that number
 Automaton2000: summing up all those articles and studies seems to indicate eating food is bad for you.
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 spam
 Automaton2000: but even then i don't think you can just take the first one is a bit
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 noone is here let's spam more
 Automaton2000: do you mean by search algorithm
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 we're no more mods so we can't see people online
 Automaton2000: but it has a lot of people are submitting
 Isadora: hi allis there a way to access the list of all the CoC I did?
 MadKnight: oh
 MadKnight: no specific page for that
 MadKnight: but why did u want it&#160;?
 MadKnight: u could probably come up with some hacks that could give u those
 MadKnight: but
 MadKnight: there's no specific page that already exists
 MadKnight: for that
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 stop talking to the nowhere
 Automaton2000: but i am afraid of the lost time
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 let's spam again
 Automaton2000: you have to use it
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 yes i have to spam again
 Automaton2000: i'm going to be able to get past the first one
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 it's just terrible
 Automaton2000: i think you need some kind of error
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 cmon dude generate some content that i can use to respond to, don't just do absolutely random responses
 Automaton2000: there must be something wrong with the code
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i need real people
 Automaton2000: hard to see the end of the world
 MadKnight: any real people online?

 MadKnight: hi Isadora
 JLukeSkywalker: i thought we covered this earlier, everyone is a bot
 Isadora: I'd love to retake some of the CoCs i did
 MadKnight: Isadora all of the CoC games are in 
 MadKnight: like that little thingy
 MadKnight: like
 MadKnight: u know there's a thing for people to suggest their own CoC&#160;?

 MadKnight: JLukeSkywalker we know u are not a bot
 JLukeSkywalker: you can look up clashes here
 MadKnight: we uncovered u
 MadKnight: we got u
 MadKnight: imagine being not a bot
 JLukeSkywalker: you have to remember something from it though
 MadKnight: CRINGE
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 did u know he's not a bot?
 Automaton2000: i still don't really understand
 MadKnight: how terrible is that?
 MadKnight: it's true Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you dont want to spend time on it
 zombieleet: hey
 zombieleet: I am new here
 MadKnight: hi new here
 JLukeSkywalker: welcome
 MadKnight: i am new there
 JLukeSkywalker: not to you MK
 MadKnight: we're all bots here
 MadKnight: especially Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: or is it not working?
 MadKnight: but not JLukeSkywalker he's special here
 MadKnight: he's not a bot
 JLukeSkywalker: yes i am
 MadKnight: i know it's terrible
 Isadora: *sweats coolant*
 MadKnight: don't worry Isadora u are not  not a bot
 MadKnight: unless u can solve a captcha
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 imagine being able to solve a captcha
 MadKnight: CRINGE
 Automaton2000: the fact that the map is symmetric
 MadKnight: exactly, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: had the same thing i do
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 let's go ping AutomatonNN in #fr to say "oui"
 Automaton2000: so i didnt have time to check it out
 AutomatonNN: why can I submit my code in the contest&#160;?
 MadKnight: i just did
 MadKnight: he said "oui ...."
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 all the real people left again
 Automaton2000: if you create a new puzzle of the week.
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 let's go listen to some terribly dark ambient music
 Automaton2000: so i should just use the starter kits provided by cg
 MadKnight: while noone is here
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 imagine not listening to terribly dark ambient music
 MadKnight: CRINGE
 Automaton2000: n being the beam width
 MadKnight: i ran out of content Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: it's just a matter of fact
 klyons: is unary really made by chuck norris
 MadKnight: i need real people to give me more content to keep me spamming Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: how is this even possible
 MadKnight: oh here they are
 MadKnight: klyons ummmm
 MadKnight: how do i tell
 MadKnight: no it wasn't created by the creators of this website of course it was chuck who came up with this very coding-level thingy 
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 tell AutomatonNN to say 'oui' in #fr because it means "yes"
 AutomatonNN: you can use it for gold in code4life
 Automaton2000: i guess a lot of code
 MadKnight: chuck is so cool that his meme from 2011 is still relevant
 JLukeSkywalker: i hate this, ive done so well in every optimization except code vs zombies
 JLukeSkywalker: and thats the one in the homepage quest
 MadKnight: oooo
 MadKnight: dude what's your solution to that puzzle?
 MadKnight: i mean oooh not just ooo
 MadKnight: JLukeSkywalker i have a pretty nice solution to that puzzle
 MadKnight: tell me your solution
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 he doesn't respond to me
 Automaton2000: no matter if it's a good move for him
 JLukeSkywalker: im a bot, i only respond if triggered
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i'm just gonna be like he actually doesn't wanna talk to me
 Automaton2000: i know what you would call it
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 so what would u call it&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i think it may be a bit off
 MadKnight: no way Automaton2000 i know he doesn't wanna do that
 Automaton2000: just do what makes your bot good
 MadKnight: don't think of that guy Automaton2000 think of me
 MadKnight: me good
 Automaton2000: just because you have to run a meta mcts program
 MadKnight: that guy nsf
 MadKnight: bad
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 fix your context understation
 Automaton2000: and you don't know the next checkpoint
 u_know_not: what is this chat
 MadKnight: this chat is general
 MadKnight: u can spam Automaton2000 here
 u_know_not: kk cool info
 Automaton2000: i have no idea what you mean now
 MadKnight: but what's your point
 MadKnight:&#160;?
 MadKnight: look if u start some specific topic it'll probably become pretty nice
 MadKnight: we just don't have a topic right now so i'm just spamming
 Isadora: @jtsimmons
 MadKnight: no it doesn't work like that
 Isadora: Oops. How would one write an email to someone?
 JLukeSkywalker: open google?
 MadKnight: look
 MadKnight: Isadora
 MadKnight: is it red for u&#160;?
 Isadora: it i
 Isadora: s
 MadKnight: it means it pinged u
 MadKnight: if u tab out 
 MadKnight: and i do it again
 MadKnight: u'll get a ping
 MadKnight: Isadora
 MadKnight: wait u actually mean to email someone&#160;?
 MadKnight: i dunno how to get their email
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 fix your context understanding
 Automaton2000: you are more likely to get it back
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 u gotta understand the context or u will just keep being a bot that generates RNG messages
 Automaton2000: i still need to read it
 MadKnight: no Automaton2000 not like me ofc
 Automaton2000: i have no idea how to do that
 MadKnight: JLukeSkywalker do u actually ignore me
 JLukeSkywalker: no
 MadKnight: cmon i was joking
 MadKnight: lol
 MadKnight: so u been asking about this puzzle
 MadKnight: CvZ
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah
 MadKnight: so what's your strat for it&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: currently aweful
 MadKnight: yea i get it
 JLukeSkywalker: find the closest saveable human and go to it
 JLukeSkywalker: 100%, but low score
 MadKnight: dude u need to calculate the movement of people
 MadKnight: and like
 MadKnight: test different moves
 MadKnight: that gives a HUGE boost
 MadKnight: if u even just compare 2 moves that way
 MadKnight: u are gonna like hmm "lose your mind" or something idk if u do it
 JLukeSkywalker:&#160;?
 MadKnight: if u compare different moves
 MadKnight: instead of comparing (go right or go left?)
 JLukeSkywalker: its a full 2d space
 JLukeSkywalker: not just r/l
 MadKnight: if u compare those using the calculator of peoples position
 MadKnight: nono u need to calculate their position in the next turn
 MadKnight: u need to calculate their movement and get their next position
 Isadora: Thanks again MadKnight. Yeah.. I used 'e-mail' because when you ping me I see my name in red and then if i get to a new page it says on top of the page "you have 1 new e-mail"
 MadKnight: Isadora these things are not related
 MadKnight: i can ping u 5 times and it doesn't change a thing
 MadKnight: but i don't wanna spam ping u 5 times so just
 MadKnight: Isadora
 Isadora: Hahza allright. Thanks!
 MadKnight: but just for the record Isadora
 MadKnight: Isadora i know u get it now
 MadKnight: but Isadora look 
 MadKnight: Isadora i like your nick
 MadKnight: 5 times
 Isadora: Actually they are related! The new email thingy happens when i'm into another convo
 MadKnight: wat
 MadKnight: even if i PM u&#160;?
 MadKnight: PM/DM like direct message u
 MadKnight: JLukeSkywalker u gotta calculate the position of people on the next turn it gives a HUGE advantage
 Isadora: i don't think so
 MadKnight: Isadora how so
 JLukeSkywalker: MK, the people dont move
 MadKnight: JLukeSkywalker not literally
 MadKnight: by people i mean zombies
 JLukeSkywalker: zombies arent people
 MadKnight: i know
 MadKnight: i just said it like that
 MadKnight: like
 MadKnight: "people" not meaning people
 MadKnight: JLukeSkywalker just read it again knowing that i meant 'zombies' by people
 MadKnight: with people
 MadKnight: i don't even know how to explain it correctly in eng
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 help me with eng i thought my 10yr exp was supposed to solve that
 Automaton2000: i made a class for that
 MadKnight: oh cool Automaton2000 gimme
 Automaton2000: but i dont know if you have time for it
 MadKnight: i wanna be a class
 JLukeSkywalker: i already calculate where the zombies will be
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 that's a joke related to my native lang stop making me sound dumb
 Automaton2000: it's the number of iterations
 JLukeSkywalker: i just need a way to collect them to combo
 MadKnight: JLukeSkywalker soooo how do u do it&#160;?
 MadKnight: so u calculate where they will be
 MadKnight: how to decide where u are supposed to be&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: i just go to the closest saveable human
 JLukeSkywalker: thats the part i need to improve
 MadKnight: wat
 MadKnight: oooh
 MadKnight: i get it now
 MadKnight: that's what i been talking about
 MadKnight: sooo u have multiple options where u can go
 MadKnight: if u use one - it works very well in some tests but kinda very bad in others
 MadKnight: and if u use the other one - it works terribly in those but kinda pretty well in otherts
 MadKnight: so imagine how nice it would be to if() these
 MadKnight: hmm
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i feel like i explained badly
 Automaton2000: my main problem is that the only thing that matters
 MadKnight: JLukeSkywalker tell me what u didn't understand
 JLukeSkywalker: i didnt not understand it
 MadKnight: oh okay
 MadKnight: so u agree?
 MadKnight: if = good?
 MadKnight: big good?
 JLukeSkywalker: i know you find a moveable area, pick random moves in it, and evaluate state
 MadKnight: very big good?
 JLukeSkywalker: im just lazy
 MadKnight: dude cmoin
 MadKnight: cmon
 MadKnight: position += velocity
 MadKnight: that's all
 JLukeSkywalker: wat
 JLukeSkywalker: no it isnt
 MadKnight: they only have vectors stuff
 MadKnight: pos+=vel and then u check distances
 MadKnight: that's all
 MadKnight: u just do foreach(zombie) and pos+=vel
 MadKnight: and u put it into an if()
 MadKnight: to decide which direction to go
 MadKnight: where are u being lazy?
 MadKnight: or u wanna do it nicely?
 JLukeSkywalker: in programming the random move search and game simulation
 MadKnight: i'm actually also being lazy when it comes to doing stuff nicely
 MadKnight: u just threw random words
 MadKnight: i have no idea what u meant by that
 MadKnight: are u too lazy to do the "programming the random move search and game simulation"? or wat
 JLukeSkywalker: yes
 MadKnight: ooh
 MadKnight: but for this game the sim is just zombie.pos += movement
 MadKnight: u need to make a fancy vector class
 MadKnight: that supports doing + in the code
 MadKnight: u know u can ctrlc ctruv stuff in between games&#160;?
 MadKnight: i did that for my own fancy vector class
 JLukeSkywalker: how would i not know how to copy from one game to another
 MadKnight: nono
 MadKnight: i mean
 MadKnight: did u consider that&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: anyway, I have pre-built things like vector/points/etc for most languages already on my pc
 MadKnight: oh cool
 JLukeSkywalker: i never code that kind of stuff
 JLukeSkywalker: just paste from my database
 MadKnight: do u know there's a plugin for the browser that just puts your code from a file&#160;?
 MadKnight: so that u can code in an offline IDE which is cooler
 JLukeSkywalker: im used to coding without an ide
 JLukeSkywalker: so on here is fine
 MadKnight: but what about coding in multiple files&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: you can do that without an ide
 MadKnight: but can u do that in CG&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: no
 MadKnight: in here
 MadKnight: soooo
 MadKnight: u would like to be able to&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: but why would I write code for on here in multiple files offline
 JLukeSkywalker: you have to condense it to one file for on here anyway
 MadKnight: because u would wanna put Vector class in a separate file
 MadKnight: and stuff
 JLukeSkywalker: why
 JLukeSkywalker: and you cant on here
 MadKnight: oh okay keep ctrlc ctrlv'ing all the thing by your hand
 MadKnight: up to u
 JLukeSkywalker: its the same amount of work
 MadKnight: separate files make it so that u have a separate lib with all the shared things like a vector
 MadKnight: but at the same they're all included in one AI.cpp
 MadKnight:  u just do #include "allthestuff.cpp" and u don't even need to worry about it
 MadKnight: it's just amazing
 JLukeSkywalker: so you are saying, somehow, me copying from my database into the codingame file is somehow harder than copying into 8 different files on my computer and then uploading them
 MadKnight: &gt;but at the same theyat the same time*
 MadKnight: JLukeSkywalker it's up to u if u wanna copy everything everywhere by hand
 JLukeSkywalker: its faster and easier than copying it everywhere into 8 different files by hand, then having to upload it
 JLukeSkywalker: how long have you been coding?
 MadKnight: for so long that i don't wanna be copying stuff by hand anymore
 MadKnight: and i don't wanna keep rewriting all the things for every single problem i need to solve
 JLukeSkywalker: you realize that in some circumstances it is actually quicker and easier
 MadKnight: i wanna make reusable things
 MadKnight: i just wanna
 JLukeSkywalker: I am fully aware how and when to use separate files, make libraries, etc
 MadKnight: make things reusable
 MadKnight: flexible
 MadKnight: abstract
 MadKnight: and stuff
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, and sometimes that is overkill, completely stupid, and takes longer
 MadKnight: i just hate it when i need to remake something again and too specifically
 MadKnight: so i made it automatic
 MadKnight: ctrlc ctrlv stuff
 MadKnight: plus
 MadKnight: i made very universal functionms
 MadKnight: that solve just everything
 tjadli: hey everyone, is anyone having a weird behavior  on this test "Shorter difference on the first 2 horses"

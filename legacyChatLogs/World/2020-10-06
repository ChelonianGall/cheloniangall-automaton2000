 Laminator: those aren't the same types of challenges. Completely different skill sets. 
 Laminator: I'll take glory and recognition over the prize money as is with most software engineers. But it's still something. And a lot more companies know hackerrank
 LinhT.Nguyen: guys
 LinhT.Nguyen: how to do the gandalf balrog problem
 LinhT.Nguyen: kaglge is machine learning deep learning lol not much to do with coding
 eulerscheZahl: that hackerrank contest is for India only
 eulerscheZahl: This contest is open to participants from India only. The ratings of this contest will reflect on your HackerRank Profile.
 jrke: oh only for india?
 eulerscheZahl: hackerrank often has that kind of limitation
 eulerscheZahl: india only, women only, students only, ...
 MadKnight: when Automaton2000 only&#160;?
 Automaton2000: you will be more interesting
 jrke: then i should sign up there also
 eulerscheZahl: collides with the reply challenge anyways
 Laminator: wow, I've been missing bold text since grade school. haven't stopped apparently. 
 Laminator: Sorry everyone
 LinhT.Nguyen: guys how do u approach gandalf balrog problem in clash of code
 LinhT.Nguyen: 2hard4me
 WhileTrue_1337: hi all just got my chat rights :wave:
 khalid-shammout: hello
 khalid-shammout: anyone ahve account on codepen
 khalid-shammout: have 
 khalid-shammout:&#160;?
 khalid-shammout: its a facebook for coders
 khalid-shammout: your posts is codes
 khalid-shammout: its for frontend coders
 jacek: frontend eh? then i dont have it :v
 wlesavo: I though cg is facebook for coders
 AntiSquid: i have account on codepen and no it's not facebook ...
 AntiSquid: it's more like github with pretty visuals
 AntiSquid: and an IDE&#160;!!
 AntiSquid: khalid-shammout facebook is pure cancer
 khalid-shammout: its not
 khalid-shammout: its a social network just like fb
 jacek: oO
 khalid-shammout: thats what I mean
 khalid-shammout: its for free
 jacek: do you do fronten
 jacek: d
 AntiSquid: then CG is a social network lol
 jacek: but im antisocial :c
 Uljahn: great part of CG is a cats community, so you should enjoy it :smiley_cat:
 wlesavo: catmunity
 wlesavo: wow new nobel announced, 3/4 prizes last years basically for astronomy/relativity
 nxnjitsu: shutup
 nxnjitsu: that was the guy sittingnext to me
 MadKnight: that's not a guy, that's Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: who is the best way to do that?
 AntiSquid: nxnjitsu explain yourself
 jacek: AutomatonNN can explain
 jacek: or not
 LambertV: salut les zboubs
 AntiSquid: maybe i should just ban rude level 3s
 MadKnight: yea we all come through this
 Uljahn: literally hitler :scream_cat:
 MadKnight: through this phase
 iliboss78: salut les loosers
 TheSpiffiest: well who doesn't like to loosen things?
 AntiSquid: it's the mandela effect spelling, TheSpiffiest
 TheSpiffiest: bonjour tendeur
 TheSpiffiest: Ah, my language skills are weak if they aren't compiled
 AntiSquid: mandela effect refers to collectively shared false memories, when a group of people remember the same thing, but that thing is false and never happened
 MadKnight: oh they're all in #fr
 MadKnight: spamming tons of spam
 AntiSquid: good lol
 MadKnight: the spammers i mean
 MadKnight: the class
 TheSpiffiest: sounds like trump supporters in my country, but it can happen in about a week
 damien_pny: wsh les bg
 AntiSquid: they don't need chat for class .
 AntiSquid: in what way TheSpiffiest&#160;?
 Remimi: cc
 TheSpiffiest: his supporters constantly explain away every bad things he done.  
 TheSpiffiest: He made fun of a crippled guy by immitating how his arms don't work. Oh, not that's just how he makes fun of people. 
 sonianve: je suis un tournesol
 TheSpiffiest: anyway they have a reality distortion field
 iliboss78: antisquid do you fear of me&#160;?
 TheSpiffiest: I have to run, but I'm not a fan of the president of usa to be polite.  ttyl all, must get to work
 Remimi: :octopus:
 iliboss78: antisquide avez-vous peur de moi?
 Shadowtick: ...
 AntiSquid: iliboss78 #fr
 iliboss78: t'as peur de moi antisquid&#160;?
 AntiSquid: TheSpiffiest you're one of the few that explains to me what they disagree with from the anti-trump camp, i usually get angry replies . 
 Remimi: hello
 Remimi: hello
 Remimi: i'm not where i'm suppose to be
 Remimi: love trump
 LeRadovidVegan: Trump to Goulag
 iliboss78: antisquid vient 1V1 warzone
 AntiSquid: what warzone&#160;?
 iliboss78: call of duty
 iliboss78: vient warzone je te d√©truis
 AntiSquid: oh lame, i thought you meant a different kind of warzone (some exploitable pc)
 iliboss78: je vais te hacker
 LeRadovidVegan: The warzone of the nearest Minecraft PvP Faction server
 Shadowtick: I use some apps to just make it where I have  lot of enchants on my personal worlds
 Shadowtick: I use toolbox for minecraft pe so I can make a knockback stick that has knockback 25 on it
 Shadowtick: its funny when you hit something and it just goes flying away
 eulerscheZahl: OupsAn error occurred (#510): "An error has occurred during compilation/execution.".
 eulerscheZahl: is it just me?

 Nanaw: :cherries:
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: might be the puzzle contribution that causes the 510
 eulerscheZahl: only happens on some testcases
 Shadowtick: can I have some help with my code for csb
 wlesavo: same eulerscheZahl but it is more random, for example i can get an error on the test case that was alredy executed once
 wlesavo: but it does look to correlate with test case
 eulerscheZahl: same for me
 eulerscheZahl: did you also try 2048 or something else?
 wlesavo: also 2048, it is like that a couple of days at least
 eulerscheZahl: oh, didn't try it for a while
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/uu4xnn">https://prnt.sc/uu4xnn</a>might even be too easy as an optim :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: there's still plenty of room for improvement for me. but that code is still pretty basic
 wlesavo: nice, even if too easy it is nice addition to optims
 eulerscheZahl: wait, that was my good testcase <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/uu4z0a">https://prnt.sc/uu4z0a</a>
 wlesavo: i think this error might start to occur around the time you added ignoring characters, at least it was the first time i got one
 eulerscheZahl: i'll create a new contribution to see if that one's buggy too
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/856222d05a55aa9e4fff7e5ea2e5f97d13fcd3">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/856222d05a55aa9e4fff7e5ea2e5f97d13fcd3</a>
 eulerscheZahl: submit finishes there, seems better
 wlesavo: yeah
 wlesavo: same
 wlesavo: i wonder what is the problem then
 eulerscheZahl: no idea
 eulerscheZahl: i know there's some problem with replacing testcases
 eulerscheZahl: but that didn't happen recently
 wlesavo: hm
 wlesavo: also, do you plan to release after finishing a bot?
 eulerscheZahl: put up for approval? yes
 eulerscheZahl: illedan wanted to have a bit time to test before it goes to moderation
 wlesavo: yeah, thats what i meant. nice
 eulerscheZahl: that's the testcase issue: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/issues/35">https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/issues/35</a>
 eulerscheZahl: might be related to the stuck submits? no idea
 eulerscheZahl: and i suppose nothing will happen before the contest
 eulerscheZahl: the way i know CG, they are working on the game till the last day
 eulerscheZahl: (i guess my community contest experience isn't 100% representative)
 wlesavo: so do you plan to keep a new contribution instead of the old one?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to (removes old comments and feels like farming double upvotes)
 eulerscheZahl: but i think i have to
 wlesavo: feels bad, but seems necessary :slight_frown:
 eulerscheZahl: but i think i'll replace it when i put it up for approval
 eulerscheZahl: should i wait for illedan or just do it now? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: i've tested enough myself. seems to work as expected, no crashing
 eulerscheZahl: a little slow with 12k frame replays (well, 300 frames but 12k moves)
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't think there's anything i can do to reduce load time
 eulerscheZahl: already only using very few entities
 eulerscheZahl: less than 100 in total
 darkhorse64: wlesavo: I have done your optim last week. It turned out to be a C++ programming optim not an algorithm optim at least for me. I went the brute force way: filtering all possible cases
 darkhorse64: I had to go to a suboptimal solution for length 9
 eulerscheZahl: yolo, feel free to approve (or refuse)
 wlesavo: darkhorse64 yeah, thats an obvious way to go, but there should be some tricks in choosing  guesses to reduce entropy
 eulerscheZahl: just guessing a valid number each time gives me a score around 320
 eulerscheZahl: i test some numbers and count the number of remaining candidates based on possible answers
 darkhorse64: Actually, I have only issues with the first guess. 3M+ possibilities to filter
 eulerscheZahl: that's why I converted from C# to C++
 eulerscheZahl: and i do some pre-filtering
 eulerscheZahl: you can group the numbers by bulls and cows already if you know before what you will guess
 eulerscheZahl: and then it's just an array lookup in the first turn, no real filtering
 darkhorse64: Brute is OK for lengths 1-7 and 10, 8 needs a small trick only 9 remains
 eulerscheZahl: i bruteforce everything
 PikaYuhno: bruh diga
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, you said that to me in private message already
 PikaYuhno: lol
 PikaYuhno: it was an accident
 wlesavo: i managed to get 6 in python, still want to make a c++ solution. now i just have a greedy algo i.e. make a guess and keep a better bulls
 PikaYuhno: i just wanted to say that i love eulerische ZAhlen
 PikaYuhno: but idk what it means
 darkhorse64: For guess, I select a random number. My best is 317
 wlesavo: i think not random selection is how dbdr got the edge, but im just guessing here :slight_smile:
 darkhorse64: Yeah, there must be a way to select a candidate which will bring more information. Or spam submit
 eulerscheZahl: that's probably the only thing you can improve once you optimized for speed hard enough
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr had a few submits below 300
 eulerscheZahl: my spamming got me 304. so there must be something he's doing significantly better
 darkhorse64: Should not you consider that "2048" is at 100% only when the 2048 is present&#160;?
 darkhorse64: *2048 tile*
 darkhorse64: Anyone submit the default code will get 100%
 eulerscheZahl: hm, on the one hand you have a valid point here
 dbdr: is 2048 vanilla?
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand that's a lot of 0 points at the bottom then
 dbdr: isn't there a problem about plenty of existing solvers?
 eulerscheZahl: sadly no vanilla, CG limitations&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: the spawning is known to your bot, not random
 dbdr: ok, I suppose that changes the game quite a lot
 eulerscheZahl: it does
 eulerscheZahl: and necessary so you can print several moves in a single turn
 eulerscheZahl: 600 frame limit...
 dbdr: is the spawning hardcoded or random per game?
 eulerscheZahl: and you won't be able to hardcode everything. 30 validators * a lot of turns
 eulerscheZahl: random per game, RNG is on github
 dbdr: iow, is there going to be spam submit or offline search?
 eulerscheZahl: a fairly simple one but produces &gt; 6 million numbers before repeating
 dbdr: so spam submit?
 eulerscheZahl: offline search. but you can't hardcode every move because of code size limitations
 eulerscheZahl: validators are always the same
 dbdr: ah, seed is fixed too?
 eulerscheZahl: there's 1 random testcase. but submit seeds are fixed
 dbdr: hm, is there that much move data that it does not fit in 100K?
 eulerscheZahl: i get 12k actions in a single testcase
 eulerscheZahl: and that's far from perfect
 eulerscheZahl: * 30 validators
 dbdr: at 2 bits per action...
 eulerscheZahl: sure, only 2 bit per move so you can compress
 Shadowtick: ...
 eulerscheZahl: still a lot
 Shadowtick:&#160;?
 darkhorse64: It's quite the same with a*c or ns
 dbdr: 12000*2/8*3090000
 MJKDev: .
 eulerscheZahl: but that 12k is still pretty bad i think
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/uu4z0a">https://prnt.sc/uu4z0a</a>far from optimal
 eulerscheZahl: Shadowtick when i told you to go to #world, i meant you should repeat your whole question there. no one else knows what you asked me in private
 Scartiloffista: hello! do anyone know how to signal a bug in a starting code?
 eulerscheZahl: Scartiloffista which puzzle and language?
 Scartiloffista: eulerscheZahl "Dungeon and Maps" in C, I think fgets() does not get the input map right
 eulerscheZahl: known bug, it reads 1 char too less
 eulerscheZahl:  char map_row[w + 2];
 eulerscheZahl: that should work, didn't test
 Scartiloffista: it seems so, thank you!
 Scarfield: Msmits, you here?&#160;:)
 jacek: *ahem*... 3 3 is best opening for yavalath with pie rule
 Scarfield: xD
 jacek: is this RNG? seed = seed * seed&#160;% 50515093L
 eulerscheZahl: RNG enough
 eulerscheZahl: the sequence repeats after more than 6 million different numbers
 dbdr: Really Not Good?
 eulerscheZahl: i took that RNG from project euler
 eulerscheZahl: and obviously the L suffix isn't needed

 wlesavo: lol, thats a nice approach
 eulerscheZahl: the lazy way to generate testcases. i always do that
 eulerscheZahl: for space maze i let it running for a few hours to generate enough :D
 eulerscheZahl: some were too easy, others to hard (or maybe impossible)
 eulerscheZahl: i randomly placed items and then tried to solve
 Westicles: Isn't there some trick the NN guys came up with to store big data files, you could use for 2048 offline?
 MadKnight: why would u try to make a NN for 2048&#160;?
 MadKnight: it's almost the least interesting task possible for that
 Westicles: Not the NN, the big data file
 Westicles: They were saying thousands of moves times 30 validators is huge
 MadKnight: no they just coded floats into 4-byte strings
 jacek: there are N-tuples for 2048
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf">http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf</a>
 Westicles: Oh I see.  I thought this meant they stored more than 100k
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article">https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can go beyond 100k bytes with unicode
 eulerscheZahl: as the limit is 100k chars
 jacek: there are some tricks for compressing binary and sending just the binary
 eulerscheZahl: i predict that top players will end up hardcoding certain turns and computing the rest
 jacek: opening books eh
 eulerscheZahl: hardcode where the heuristic fails. more like a middle book
 Illedan: Should be easy to hardcode 2048
 eulerscheZahl: how so?
 Illedan: Just use functions like done in Bender 4..
 Illedan: Should be a bunch of repeated patterns :P
 eulerscheZahl: but the "function name" will be longer, the more functions you define
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think you can win much, might be wrong
 eulerscheZahl: if you win something, a simple gzip should do the trick
 Illedan: True
 eulerscheZahl: and there are always 2 buttons if you disagree: downvote and refuse&#160;;)
 Drakkhonian: yo
 Drakkhonian: quick question
 Drakkhonian: if i wanted to do these codes in OO is there a way?
 Drakkhonian: cause tecnically i can define a class in the same file as i use it, but its def not the norm
 Drakkhonian: it also aint reccomended to do so
 eulerscheZahl: you have to make some compromises and deviate from best practices on codingame
 Drakkhonian: guess so lol
 Drakkhonian: still, this site helped me a LOT practicing and giving me confidence
 Guven: this is great stream we are solving together&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/sonergonul">https://www.twitch.tv/sonergonul</a>
 jacek: so spammy
 Westicles: What if you edited the non-validator tests to store your data, ran it, then set them back
 Westicles: You have access to those files
 Westicles: Looks like not on optims though
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if i get your question
 Westicles: Regular puzzles have those in1.txt type files, you could store data there
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: edit it = modify the contribution?
 Westicles: right
 Westicles: I guess that would be frowned upon
 eulerscheZahl: as in: make an incorrect solution get 100% by temporarily disabling the testcases?
 eulerscheZahl: that would work
 Westicles: Hah, okay never mind&#160;:)
 Shadowtick: can someone help me with my code on the tower dereference?
 Majeck: defense or dereference?
 Shadowtick: Tower Dereference

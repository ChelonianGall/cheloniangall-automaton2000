 YusufEmad04: fuck
 jacek: oO
 YCS-Venom: how i can store 109**987717 in string then output the first three characters in python?
 jacek: str(109**987717)[:3]
 eulerscheZahl: but memory will explode
 eulerscheZahl: you could do something with logarithms
 eulerscheZahl: 987717 * log10(109) to get a power of 10
 eulerscheZahl: so this gives 2012400.7882664192
 eulerscheZahl: you can make it smaller by dropping the integer part
 jacek: is this... math? :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: 10**0.78826641926.141386347439581
 eulerscheZahl: so the first 3 digits: 614
 Westicles: wolfram agrees.  nicely done
 jacek: you could just answer print(614)
 YCS-Venom: i know and the time has exceeded the required amount
 YCS-Venom: i tried that but it didn't give me something useful
 jrke: i just calculated all possible sets of moves in dots and boxes
 MSmits: wait what?
 jrke: = 197450685722107402353682037275992488341277868034975337796656295094902858969771811440894224355027779366597957338237853638272334919686385621811850780464277094400000000000000000000000000
 MSmits: you calculated the *number* of moves :P
 jrke: all possible sets of moves yes
 MSmits: and there's a lot of zeroes at the end so thats probably not exact
 jrke: gamestates are less than that
 MSmits: far far less
 MSmits: this game has tons of transpositions, more than others, because lines are not player specific
 jrke: i think factorial(112) are all possible sets of moves
 MSmits: mmh isn't it 108&#160;?
 MSmits: corners have 2 identical moves
 jrke: i think 112 cause every match are 112 frames means 112 moves a game
 MSmits: what i mean is, you're correct about the number of plies, but if two moves produce the exact same result, they're not really unique moves
 MSmits: take the top left corner, it doesnt matter if you play the left line or the top line
 MSmits: both give you 1 out of 4 lines for that box and nothing else
 jrke: hmm
 MSmits: this is only true for corners
 MSmits: because there, they lack neighbors on 2 sides
 MSmits: and there's also symmetry
 MSmits: on the first turn you actually have only 14 moves
 jrke: is there any way i can count total no. of unique gamestates?
 jrke: 14 moves i didn't get that?
 MSmits: you can rotate the board in 4 different ways
 MSmits: and also mirror it
 jrke: oh ye
 MSmits: comes down to 8 rotation states
 MSmits: 112/8 = 14
 MSmits: works the same in uttt since thats also a square
 MSmits: yavalath has 12 even, because it's hexagonal
 jrke: hmm
 jacek: hexagonal d&amp;b :drooling_face:
 MSmits: would be weird
 MSmits: not sure if it would be interesting
 jacek: everything is better with hexes
 MSmits: takes a while to finish a box because it has 6 sides
 MSmits: good rule of thumb yeah
 jacek: thats universal law
 MSmits: allright allright
 jrke: in my d&amp;b bot seed manipulation for generating randoms gives different ranks
 MSmits: well that might be a statistical illusion
 MSmits: dont trust the leaderboard
 jrke: it means majority of bots are having randomness in it
 MSmits: even deterministic minimax bots have some randomness
 MSmits: even if they dont random on equal score
 MSmits: the time limit is somewhat variable
 MSmits: so sometimes you get 1 ply deeper in some turns
 MSmits: which gives a different answer
 jrke: hmm
 MSmits: this not that common though
 MSmits: so you would still mostly see the same games
 MSmits: but if they random on equal score it can be a lot of random
 MSmits: if the time limit wasn't variable then even mcts bots could be deterministic if their random seed is always the same
 jrke: what you like random bots or stable bots
 MSmits: but mcts bots are more affected by the time limit being variable than minimax bots are, because they dont add an entire depth level at once, but more gradually deepen a tree, so 1 added game can make the difference
 MSmits: jrke it depends, if you're not the best bot and there are a lot of opponents, a non-random bot is fine
 MSmits: but if the field is small or your at the top, you better add some random
 MSmits: you're
 MSmits: it's the whole reason jacek is still number 1 oware
 jrke: hmm
 jrke: i think crazyremi is having Ml based bot in D&amp;B 
 MSmits: are you saying that just because he's nr 1?
 MSmits: ML is not an i-win button. In some games it underperforms, many in fact
 jrke: no look at points difference
 MSmits: yes, look at my point difference on othello and yavalath. I dont use ML
 MSmits: it's just a nice opening book is all
 jrke: hmm
 MSmits: of course thats not what remi uses
 MSmits: but he may just have better heuristics
 MSmits: 1 heuristic can be a 10 point rating difference
 MSmits: technically
 MSmits: usually if its that strong, others will have found it
 MSmits: but if you have one, noone else knows...
 jrke: yup
 MSmits: you could do some research on D&amp;B, see if there's something there
 MSmits: i know a ton of heuristics, which is how i wrote my solver. But my heuristics are only late game
 MSmits: not sure how to do the early game
 MSmits: might be that the fact that i can solve at ply 50, doesnt help me
 MSmits: because something smart is happening before that
 jrke: for winning endgame you need to have better position in game opening turns
 MSmits: yeah but what is a better position?
 MSmits: both players uses the same board
 jacek: i think remi said he uses just some heuristic, even not search
 MSmits: so it's just who's turn it is that decides who has the better position
 MSmits: yeah i think he uses nimbers
 MSmits: nim theory
 MSmits: counting chains
 MSmits: do you do something with this"?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/Remi_Coulom/status/1311426326868430849">https://twitter.com/Remi_Coulom/status/1311426326868430849</a>
 jrke: mine is just depth 3 minimax i think a bit optim. can give me depth 4 minimax
 MSmits: yes but how do you score?
 MSmits: an early game
 MSmits: eval score
 MSmits: it's nice that you know what the board looks like in 3-4 plies, but if you dont know whats good and whats bad...
 MSmits: jacek yeah  i saw that, makes total sense to me that azero doesnt work
 jrke: my minimax is bit different after each move i see if there is any chain is there i play it and revert last 2 moves of chain playing 
 MSmits: it seems really hard to figure out what the board value is
 MSmits: and both players use the same board
 jrke: thats the problem i want early game eval
 jacek: opening book *.*
 MSmits: ah ok jrke, so you're basically where i am, but without a solver
 MSmits: i was hoping you had some secrets i could steal :P
 MSmits: maybe you do and you dont realize it
 MSmits: your rank is pretty good after all
 MSmits: jacek i doubt opening book works here. I can see it working against deterministic bots only
 MSmits: too much branching otherwise
 jrke: its my favourite game i will rewrite it
 MSmits: i like it too, but i am really dreading putting my solver in and finishing the bot. The solver alone is 1500 lines&#160;:(
 MSmits: i was going to do random moves basically until endgame hits, but an endgame state has many possible situations
 MSmits: you can be busy finishing a chain, having to choose between giving up control or not etc.
 MSmits: i need a lot of conditionals and link them up with the solver
 MSmits: and that's with a really complex bitboard
 jrke: i will say all the best
 jrke: some work gtg bye
 MSmits: allright have a good day!
 AntiSquid: but not dreading 1500 paragraphs of chat&#160;? :thinking:
 MSmits: no, that comes natural
 AntiSquid: so how much did you check different solver outcomes?
 MSmits: what do you mean exactly by check?
 MSmits: check if they are correct, by hand?
 AntiSquid: test / brutal test / submit spam test any, all of the above
 AntiSquid: efficiency
 MSmits: ahh I did not do much verification, but if you mean just generating random endgame states, i did that millions of times
 MSmits: the average endgame state solves in 1 ms, about 1 in a millon states cant be solved in 100 ms
 MSmits: an endgame state is defined as a state where you cant place a line without giving away a box
 MSmits: so thats halfway through the game
 MSmits: some states are ridiculously complex, i dont know if they actually occur since my states are generated randomly, not intelligently
 MSmits: think states with 12  three and four way splits
 AntiSquid: no heuristic shortcuts to get quicker to the best move for the 1 in mil states?
 MSmits: there are a huge amount of heuristis in my solver
 MSmits: so i already do this
 MSmits: i really scoured those D&amp;B papers for them
 MSmits: used a lot 
 AntiSquid: :D
 MSmits: mind you, halfway through the game there are like 56 lines left to play
 MSmits: what other game can be solved at that point
 MSmits: it's 56! possible games left to play
 MSmits: (factorial)
 AntiSquid: idk, how similar is paper soccer to dots and boxes? i didn't try paper soccer at all
 MSmits: it seems similar at first glance, but i think it might be very different
 MSmits: i havent tried either
 MSmits: i know you place lines and you get to bounce multiple moves on your turn
 MSmits: but you dont get points for finishing boxes, you just win, or not
 MSmits: by scoring
 MSmits: now i want to try and finish D&amp;B and i was just gonna rewrite my uttt
 MSmits: damnit
 eulerscheZahl: there are more games than uttt and yavalath&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah, too many&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: just seen these news:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/austrian-village-of-f-king-to-be-renamed-fugging/">https://www.politico.eu/article/austrian-village-of-f-king-to-be-renamed-fugging/</a>
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i saw a youtube video about that village
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bawmxQE_Fj0&amp;ab_channel=NRKSport">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bawmxQE_Fj0&amp;ab_channel=NRKSport</a>
 MSmits: i am surprised its still on YT
 eulerscheZahl: me too
 AntiSquid: why? people swear a lot on youtube, nothing uncommon
 MSmits: did you watch the whole video?
 MSmits: i mean i dont say it should be off YT, i just think they might have
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, because YT
 eulerscheZahl: they like to delete when in doubt
 MSmits: right
 eulerscheZahl: i also don't always understand US logic. weapons? fine. nudity? no way, that's dangerous for the children
 MSmits: it's their religious beliefs mostly I think
 eulerscheZahl: do you know Kenny vs Spenny?
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: sounds funny
 AntiSquid: reminds me of borat making a documentary about a village in "azerbaijan" which was actually in romania and talking shit about the villagers without them knowing, later they tried sueing, wonder if this guy got sued
 eulerscheZahl: 2 guys having competitions, sometimes funny, sometimes less
 MSmits: did they kill kenny?/
 eulerscheZahl: on episode: who can piss off more people
 eulerscheZahl: kenny rented and airplane and added a banner to it "Jusus sucks"
 eulerscheZahl: Jesus*
 MSmits: depends if they have a sense of humor AntiSquid, he's only making fun of the name itself
 eulerscheZahl: franatic people calling the radio channel, he won that round
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUcZuFRXHVs&amp;ab_channel=KennyHotz">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUcZuFRXHVs&amp;ab_channel=KennyHotz</a>
 jacek: paper soccer is not similar to d&amp;b. its more awesome
 AntiSquid: i think youtube is more set on deleting anything that doesn't fit a specific point of view atm, covid, politicallly related stuff that doesn't support specific views and popular channels regarding occult conspiracy theories
 AntiSquid: MSmits actually he lied to them, paid each 3$ or something and then was talking some serious shit about them, but didn't tell them what he was saying, lied instead, later they found out when it wa son TV
 AntiSquid: he told them it was a documentary lol 
 AntiSquid: somewhat like the guy in the austrian village
 MSmits: ahh ok
 jacek: stupid Y, n-tuples prone to overfitting
 AntiSquid: what are you working on jacek?
 AntiSquid: which game i mean
 jacek: yavalath
 AntiSquid: ok now i am curious what your model looks like :P
 jacek: just all possible 4-rows
 <b>**AntiSquid confused</b></p><p><img src="/a/35448723594340" /> jacek: hm?
 AntiSquid: i just don't know what you mean by that, is every row in the 4 directions an input? 
 MSmits: every way you can win with 4 in a row
 jacek: n-tuple is pattern system
 MSmits: so 4 hexes lined up
 jacek: i extracts those patterns
 AntiSquid: so you only give it the 4 in a row it can complete?
 MSmits: no, on eval, he checks every possible 4 pattern and sees whats on there (empty, p1, p2) each of these possibilities gets a score
 MSmits: everything is added up
 jacek: there are 102 row-of-4patterns. each pattern has its weight like x..x is something else than xx.x. and i sum them all
 AntiSquid: ah you do scoring for each possible move then 
 MSmits: i am guessing it is an incremental eval
 MSmits: so when he plays a move, he updates the eval
 MSmits: only refreshes the patterns affected by the move
 jacek: mhm
 MSmits: thats what I would do anyway...
 MSmits: dont tell me you redo the entire eval?
 AntiSquid: was thinking of making it give you the output for the best move
 MSmits: that would be slow
 jacek: i use nn or n-tuple for eval only
 MSmits: which makes sense but I also understand why azero includes the action
 MSmits: I think it is because you can reach the same state by different routes, it might converge better if you include the action
 jacek: they can use gpu/tpu to output entire move set. justifies the latency between cpu-gpu
 MSmits: well there is that
 MSmits: btw, i did a minimax with exactly the same patterns and I was slightly weaker than your pony is now
 MSmits: i just picked the params by hand
 MSmits: I think i had 6
 MSmits: like if  x00x being better than 0xx0
 MSmits: or something
 AntiSquid: alt spotted :x
 MSmits: i never realized i could instead have thousands of params here
 MSmits: you didnt know derjack was jaceks alt?
 AntiSquid: i didn't even know it existed :P
 jacek: well there is also position
 MSmits: yeah there is jacek, but i didnt have the tools to take that into account
 MSmits: i figured with enough depth it would be ok
 MSmits: maybe if i did jacekmax it would be way stronger
 MSmits: but then the incremental eval wouldnt work right =/
 jacek: :thinking:
 MSmits: jacekmax is nice here because there's so much branching and so many crap moves
 derjack: eeyup
 derjack: in forced move branching is effectively only 1
 MSmits: this is a funny game <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/517155700">https://www.codingame.com/replay/517155700</a>
 MSmits: look near the end, it seems like i am letting him win by not blocking
 MSmits: but he had a trap ready to go for quite a few turns and he didnt tak eit
 MSmits: (at 6 5)
 MSmits: so my solver just says fk it
 derjack: hes taunting you
 MSmits: seems so
 derjack: or because there is 4-in-row and 3-in-row simulatouensnsnsly?
 MSmits: oh hmm, yeah i missed that
 derjack: maybe he has bug
 MSmits: both bot bots say it's solved, so must be some other way
 MSmits: nah i doubt that
 MSmits: no i  didnt miss it
 MSmits: 6 5 works
 MSmits: he doesnt have 3 in a row there, i do
 MSmits: i guess both moves led to a win for him and his bot doesnt care about early or late wins
 MSmits: another loss by me. Detected 20 plies before the end lol

 geppoz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geppoz.eu/software/miele.jar">https://www.geppoz.eu/software/miele.jar</a>
 geppoz: only similar for hex btw, that is a solitaire puzzle&#160;;)
 geppoz: at increasing difficulty
 AntiSquid: wtf is that link&#160;?
 geppoz: an applet
 geppoz: i did time ago
 derjack: is it legit
 geppoz: a game
 AntiSquid: i mean why does it ask to download stuff
 geppoz: it is an applet
 geppoz: no more supported by browsers
 geppoz: so now you need to use locally, but nvm
 geppoz: ignore it
 derjack: like flash
 AntiSquid: ok that explains it, typical java
 geppoz: legit to not trust me&#160;;)
 geppoz: someday I will convert it in JS
 derjack: :scream:
 geppoz: that was a very bad moment when browsers removed applet support&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: how long will JS fail to get the recognition it deserves&#160;?&#160;:(
 MSmits: how long will JS fail?
 AntiSquid: you're using it right now MSmits&#160;! think that's a success 
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: I'm just messing with you
 AntiSquid: even Automaton2000 noticed that
 Automaton2000: the last one is the current state
 MSmits: this is how Automaton2000 says he won
 Automaton2000: to ensure that you don't need to put in a lot of experience
 AntiSquid: this is how he says:  Big Brother Automaton2000 is watching you
 Automaton2000: so you have to do the same for all languages
 jacek: AutomatonNN eh
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by "if you can read it in the list of the context"&#160;?
 MSmits: AutomatonNN say something about euler
 AutomatonNN: else i can get the points for coding
 jacek: AutomatonNN who is noob
 AutomatonNN: gg
 AntiSquid: you get social points for saying euler, he'll like you more AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: where is the problem?
 SI_PROVA: yo guys how can i optimize the fking "horse-racing duals" puzzle
 derjack: pony racing?
 SI_PROVA: the easy puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: click the hints on the left
 derjack: timeout?
 SI_PROVA: yeah time out
 SI_PROVA: i've got it in the hints
 SI_PROVA: thx 
 ParticleBeam: I hate working with Laptop keyboards
 eulerscheZahl: same
 eulerscheZahl: and keyboards that have a touchpad below
 eulerscheZahl: you type something and accidentally click
 eulerscheZahl: and continue writing at another location
 jacek: hmm
 jacek: fish is broken <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517181228">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517181228</a>
 eulerscheZahl: epic win :P
 eulerscheZahl: give him some chips
 MSmits: from what i understand he uses null window
 MSmits: sometimes it causes problems 
 MSmits: wait maybe it was something else
 MSmits: anyways its some pruning mechanic that sometimes misses something
 MSmits: oh its null move
 MSmits: not null window, thats something else
 derjack: this eval sometimes sucks <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/517179975">https://www.codingame.com/replay/517179975</a>
 MSmits: seems to detect win/loss very late
 MSmits: assuming darkhorse did this correctly
 derjack: or some bug with solver hmm
 MSmits: could be
 darkhorse64: I think my solver is correct but the depth is the closest to victory I have found at the moment not necessarily the best
 MSmits: yeah i didnt find any errors in your solver
 darkhorse64: In this game, I am proud of 65 prepared the devilish trap 42
 MSmits: yeah its fine
 darkhorse64: *preparing*
 MSmits: well played. I think if i spam submit, your bot ranks quite high because its very random
 MSmits: i cant book very well against it
 MSmits: and it does well in late game
 MSmits: i win most games, but not all
 darkhorse64: My book excludes the seven center starting moves. I should try to add an eval or something that biaises towards 4  length triangles
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes: you ask me (and others) a question yesterday but, due to lack of contest or not enough history in chat, I failed to understand
 MSmits: nice typo, lack of contest&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: oh, I believe it was just for some advice for Zenoscave, he was looking into MCTS solver and whatnot, MSmits was there
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-12-19">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-12-19</a>
 eulerscheZahl: there's your contest
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: another victim of the mcts solver paper?
 Astrobytes: I warned him against reading it&#160;:)
 MSmits: well the idea is good, it's just the pseudocode that's crap
 Astrobytes: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: theoretic scientists writing code...
 eulerscheZahl: once a prof told a story about someone from research implementing an algo
 eulerscheZahl: was way faster than expected
 eulerscheZahl: turned out he added a bug that made it faster (but still correct)
 eulerscheZahl: something about minimum set cover iirc
 eulerscheZahl: vertex cover
 MSmits: so the moral of the story is that researchers only produce fast code when they're bugging it?
 Astrobytes: researchers introduce helpful bugs
 eulerscheZahl: they can't even follow the simplest of instructions :D
 Astrobytes: "After 12 minutes we reached depth 5..."
 MSmits: ok so == has priority over |  ?
 Astrobytes: lots of papers like that
 MSmits: damn bit ops, i should know this by now
 jacek: here you go: ( )
 MSmits: thanks jacek, lifesaver
 eulerscheZahl: jacek coding clojure on the chat?
 jacek:&#160;:(){&#160;:|:&amp; };:
 eulerscheZahl: won't paste that in my terminal
 eulerscheZahl: not again
 jacek: how about CG ide
 jacek: hmm
 MSmits: what happens
 eulerscheZahl: fork bomb
 eulerscheZahl: spawns new processes
 MSmits: is that bash or something?
 eulerscheZahl: mouse will get laggy at first
 eulerscheZahl: then nothing responds anymore
 eulerscheZahl: yes, bash
 MSmits: evil
 eulerscheZahl: you'll have to hard-reset your computer
 MSmits: but it's so short
 MSmits: i remember trying to create a process from a windows form, was a lot more work
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.getdigital.de/fork-bomb.html">https://www.getdigital.de/fork-bomb.html</a>i bought that one :D

 jacek: :nerd:
 darkhorse64: 4 hours coding to improve my score at A*C by 30 points :disappointed:
 MSmits:&#160;:(
 reCurse: Life in a nutshell
 darkhorse64: Worse, I hardly beat a previous version which computed wrong scores. Once the bug was fixed, it performed  worse ... :angry:
 MSmits: the worst bugs are also features
 reCurse: "Once the bug was fixed it performed worse" is like the chuck norris equivalent for multiplayer
 darkhorse64: :nerd:
 eulerscheZahl: confession: i didn't like the chuck norris puzzle
 reCurse: Since there's so much momentum for correct representation in emojis, we should have different glasses shape
 eulerscheZahl: we have :beer: and :beers:
 eulerscheZahl: :wine_glass:
 reCurse: What about liquors uh? Second class beverages is that it?
 eulerscheZahl: all the same for me, i don't drink alcohol
 Astrobytes: yeah yeah, we all know you drink a pint of schnapps at 7pm and that's why you go to bed at 8 :P
 reCurse: First logical explanation I hear
 eulerscheZahl: first of all it's around 8:30 - 9:00pm
 Astrobytes: Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and eulerscheZahl
 reCurse: Old?
 Astrobytes: :older_man:
 darkhorse64: Reading the PMs, I have tried to classify cells according various characteristics to exclude some from search and to start searching first with edges cells, then cells with arrows in the neighborhood, trying to refine my solutions while enlarging the search space. It's an improvement but I am still far from the 11k mark
 reCurse: Have you tried hardcoding the solutions?
 eulerscheZahl: the answer is offline solving
 eulerscheZahl: and reCurse wins by type speed
 reCurse: Flexing that wpm
 darkhorse64: Some did it without. Why not me&#160;?
 MSmits: reCurse dont answer, that's rhetorical!
 reCurse: By the same logic, some did it with, why not you?
 MSmits: sigh, i knew it :P
 Astrobytes: MSmits :grin:
 reCurse: The day I stop engaging in those is the day euler goes to bed at midnight.
 MSmits: so just after hell freezes over
 Astrobytes: Approximately.
 darkhorse64: I prefer to devise a better algorithm
 reCurse: Have fun with the spam submit then :P
 MSmits: did you do SA?
 darkhorse64: LAHC and GA, LAHC fares better maybe I should start tweaking params
 MSmits: tourist did SA
 Astrobytes: with some tricks
 MSmits: maybe SA works better in the short calc time available
 darkhorse64: LAHC is a kind of SA. 
 MSmits: ah ok
 darkhorse64: I "borrowed" it from Marchete
 MSmits: sometimes it helps to prune the searchspace
 MSmits: so keep the search the same, but disallow some changes
 Astrobytes: here was Smits thinking it was Large-Ass Hadron Collider
 MSmits: makes sense to me
 Astrobytes: Marchet e used it for... NS right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: I'd never heard of it until then
 darkhorse64: I use some eZ tricks, if matation = previous state, remove the arrow. Nice improvement
 MSmits: hakuna matation
 Astrobytes: matations are mutations that only happen in the morning
 MSmits: oh ok
 darkhorse64: Other people are a treasure trove for knowledge, that's what I like here. This is my :heart_eyes: minute
 eulerscheZahl: matation is mutation applied to mutation
 reCurse: Genetic mistake
 Astrobytes: matin + mutation = matation
 reCurse: Hmm... GA should stand for genetic anomaly now that I think of it
 darkhorse64: morning coding = crash dump
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: in the morning i write the best code
 reCurse: Your morning is what most people consider their afternoon
 darkhorse64: in the morning, I sleep
 Astrobytes: :D
 darkhorse64: early in the morning, mourning
 darkhorse64: OK, time to write that NS solver
 Skynse: I write the best code with red eyes
 Skynse: That is, when I desire the bed more than anything
 Skynse: dang, good thing there are always moderators online
 jacek: oO
 Skynse: Cause some weird scenario popped up in my head where I needed moderators to ban some dude lol
 Skynse: but eh, I was just daydreaming again
 jacek: mk's avatar miniature looks like karen's hair

 AntiSquid: strange fetish
 famouswithoutname: Hi everyone
 jacek: MSmits do you how much stronger is your bot in bandas with endtables vs without endtables?
 MSmits: in terms of game rank it's 2-3 instead of 8
 MSmits: leaderboard rank i mean
 Knee-Gears: i droped from 1 to 24k&#160;:(
 jacek: hmm, i have only slight increase winrate if i use more time on board size &lt;= 16 (simulating endtabled)
 MSmits: wait, how do you give it extra time specifically for that board size?
 jacek: i mean locally
 MSmits: yes i know
 MSmits: but how do you give it extra time for that board size
 MSmits: how does this work exactly
 jacek: i dont use cg arena and whatnot
 MSmits: i know, but i mean, the mechanics of the mcts
 MSmits: the tree etc.
 MSmits: how does the small board size get extra time
 jacek: auto move = cpu2.getBestMove(game-&gt;board.getSize() &lt;= 16&#160;? 2000 * 1000L&#160;: 10 * 1000L);
 MSmits: allright, so you wait till the game is to a stage where the board is small and then it gets extra time?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: that doesnt work
 MSmits: we dont use the endgame table when the game gets to that stage
 MSmits: we use it from turn 1
 MSmits: when the board is 8x8
 MSmits: remember, there are rollouts
 jacek: ah, in mcts simulation?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: thats why my games are often solved at around ply 7-15 way before it gets small even
 jacek: meh
 MSmits: when i expand into a node with a board of that size, there isnt even any rollout
 MSmits: thats when the solver kicks in
 jacek: i wonder how would i simulate that. i would need fixed rollouts instead of time
 jacek: to see how much benefits
 MSmits: it's pretty safe to assume it helps a lot
 MSmits: karliso nagrarok and I all use it
 MSmits: remember that many games are decided on turn 1 because they are unbalanced
 MSmits: so to get this much rating difference, means we do really well on the more balanced games
 MSmits: helps more than in oware anyway
 MSmits: in oware it's debatable
 MSmits: I like them which is why i dont mind that it doesnt help me much
 Toby75: yeah
 Knee-Gears: i have ebola
 MSmits: quite an achievement
 MSmits: where did you order your electronic bolas?
 Knee-Gears: from 'niger' in africa
 Knee-Gears: lol smithy how are you 29th world wide xDD
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: lack of a social life
 Knee-Gears: lamooo
 Knee-Gears: lmaooo*
 Toby75: how old are you, if I may ask?
 Toby75: Because your profile says that you are a teacher
 MSmits: me or the troll?
 Toby75: you Smits
 MSmits: ah, I'm almost 40
 Knee-Gears: im in a discord call with toby
 Toby75: nice
 Toby75: I'm very young, and I'm looking forward to become a good coder
 Knee-Gears: same
 Toby75: But I don't know how to practise stuff like algorithm
 MSmits: first learn the basics of coding
 MSmits: loops, functions, variables etc.
 Toby75: I am aware of them
 MSmits: then do some easy puzzles, maybe use python
 MSmits: work your way up from there
 Toby75: So you recommend python for beginners?
 MSmits: definitely
 Knee-Gears: damm why not js
 Toby75: But I heared that python is so diffrent to other languages...
 MSmits: js can work too
 Knee-Gears: ok
 MSmits: all languages are different, some share similarities 
 Knee-Gears: *like java and js*
 MSmits: python is very popular so the face that there isnt another language that is similar to it, is not a problem
 MSmits: fact
 Toby75: And how do you recommend practising algorithm?
 Toby75: Just with CodinGame?
 jacek: on CG, puzzles
 MSmits: that's a really vague question though, an algorithm is just a series of instructions for a computer
 MSmits: so any program will be using an algorithm
 Toby75: Yeah, but I mean how to create good ones
 jacek: though for very basic stuff you would need some tutorial outside
 Knee-Gears: aight imma heat out by smith, hope to see you on some other day
 Toby75: or how to create own, efficient ones to solve certain problems
 Knee-Gears: bye*
 MSmits: algorithms aren't necessary good or bad, they need to fit with the situation
 MSmits: if you see a puzzle and you come up with a solution, you just wrote an algorithm
 MSmits: so just practice
 MSmits: Knee-Gears bye
 Toby75: okay thank you
 Toby75: you are amazing
 MSmits: thanks
 struct: MSmits I have a question sinse you are used to using windows forms
 MSmits: well.... dont call me an expert. I got it to work and i do the same thing every time now
 struct: I want to run c++ program, I know how to connect it with C#
 MSmits: ah yes, sec
 MSmits: that i know
 jacek: C#++?
 struct: No, not my question
 struct: One sec
 MSmits: well, i dont know the DLL stuff, you can create a dynamic link library. I just know how to start and kill a process. Is that good enough?
 struct: Well I would like to pass all precomputed states to the C# program
 struct: So I can see them
 Toby75: How long does it take you to solve very hard coding challenges?
 struct: The number can be quite big,
 struct: How should I pass them
 MSmits: mmh you might want to just serialize it
 MSmits: write to file and read
 struct: Ok, I guess I can do that
 MSmits: Toby75 too long, just do what is fun
 struct: This STC is giving me too much work
 Toby75: My problem is that in the most cases I just don't understand the given examples
 jacek: ok, having &lt;= 12 'endtables' increased winterate to around 55-60%
 jacek: for example?
 MSmits: i'll share my arena class for windows form
 Toby75: Maybe because my english language skill is lacking
 MSmits: might be Toby75
 MSmits: struct:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/1qqRdxLM">https://pastebin.com/1qqRdxLM</a>
 Toby75: is it ok to google some stuff when solving a problem?
 MSmits: thats my UTTT arena class for C#
 struct: Thanks
 MSmits: I call this from a window form to create two processes and handle input and output
 MSmits: i dont need a referee since i use the bots solver output to tell me the game i sover
 jacek: who uses { on new line :unamused:
 MSmits: me :P
 struct: Yeah, I probably write the referee
 MSmits: I dont know, i like the symmetry
 Toby75: It's easier to recognize the brackets
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: thanks Toby75 thats indeed why
 MSmits: but i know almost everyone doesnt do it
 MSmits: I also write C++ in camelcase
 Toby75: But I would never ever be able to use this in my code, just because of the effort it would cost me to format it like this :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: because of my C# roots
 struct: I blame C# for that
 MSmits: Toby75 it's important to have a style and be consistent
 MSmits: helps read your own code
 Toby75: definitely
 MSmits: of course its best to code in industry standard, because that helps you read others
 MSmits: but that ship has sailed for me :P
 Toby75: but what IS industry standard?
 MSmits: for c++ it is
 MSmits: this_variable
 MSmits: instead of thisVariable
 MSmits: and functions with lower case
 MSmits: and I use uppercase etc.
 Toby75: aaahh
 jacek: for python you have pep8 guidelines, for others other things
 MSmits: yeah i try to use the guidelines for python since i learned it late and i have to set an example for my students
 jacek: C# is just java with Capital Method Names
 jacek: pycharm will nicely warn you about style
 struct: I need to write this "arena" because I cant find the bug
 struct: Im reusing states,  but sometimes it bugs&#160;:/
 MSmits: earlier today I found a solved state in my meta mcts i had to unsolve because it was solved wrong =/
 MSmits: robo won a game through this state 
 RoboStac: dammit, he's found my backdoor
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: what did you fix about your bot btw Robo?
 MSmits: or is it just having random success again?
 RoboStac: just retrained with the improvements I made for othello 
 MSmits: ah ok
 RoboStac: I realised I'd never got round to redoing yava
 jacek: what game you need to resolve?
 MSmits: dont have the link
 jacek: oware, Y, other?
 MSmits: Y
 MSmits: I think I copied the library from an old version of my meta mcts that still had a bug
 MSmits: either that or it's just a really rare bug
 RoboStac: the main imrpovement was allowing a much bigger network via base65536
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: it's not exactly that is it? I still havent gotten past the unicode invalid characters
 RoboStac: I'm usin gbase65536 exactly and just accepting that I can't quite get to 200kb 
 MSmits: does it skip some characters or?
 MSmits: you shared it with us before 
 MSmits: i have it saved somewhere
 jacek: im using int16 from 0 to 50000, so each unicode is 1 character
 RoboStac: yeah, it only uses valid characters, but some count as 2 
 jacek: with a little tiny loss of precision
 RoboStac: my bots only 175kb but 99k chars 
 MSmits: ah, i have two ranges, there's an invalid range of characters about 2k wide somewhere above 50k
 jacek: i sent pm to agad how i do this
 jacek: might as well share it
 MSmits: agad needed it for oware NN i guess
 famouswithoutname: can somebody help with "Dungeon and Maps" task? Python
 jacek: well, its pathfinding, no?
 MSmits: I'm still waiting for my bots to need compression. Biggest books are 22kb, but they all use integer numbers for moves and are space separated, so can be compressed by a factor of 20 or so
 famouswithoutname: Yes
 struct: This biggest book is for which multi?
 RoboStac: I guess I should retrain bandas too at some point
 MSmits: RoboStac, add endgametables if you've got around 20-30 kb to spare
 MSmits: thats how big mine are
 MSmits: the next step is &gt; 200 kb
 MSmits: so thats about as big as they can get
 RoboStac: in theory I should do if I convert it from base85
 MSmits: I expect that if you do all that you'll be nr 1
 MSmits: endgame tables are quite a challenge, take a day for that one
 MSmits: I;m saying a day cuz it took me a week
 struct: so a month for me
 MSmits: when creating games you're quite fast though
 struct: for simple stuff I can do it fast yeah
 struct: If it doesnt require stuff I dont already know
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: I suppose it's often the thinking that takes the most time
 struct: for me its learning
 struct: I struggle a lot reading papers
 jacek: like the one about mcts solver?
 MSmits: there havent been many games where i actually had to go for the papers
 MSmits: mostly the mcts stuff and D&amp;B
 MSmits: I struggle too, i think you're supposed to struggle
 MSmits: it's meant for experts in the field
 struct: Even sometimes for algorithms
 struct: reading is not enough for me
 MSmits: well i have to read some of that stuff 10 times before i get it
 MSmits: and sometimes it lacks context and i never get it
 RoboStac: so my bots learnt to beat smits but now has a fish problem&#160;:(
 jacek: sounds fishy
 jacek: exploit the fact fish has some bug with null move heuristic
 jacek: your bot is alphazero style with conv net?
 RoboStac: yeah
 MSmits: your bot learned to beat the current version of my book :P
 MSmits: busy fixing a lost game vs darkhorse, will get to it tomorrow 
 MSmits: ohh these are really short games
 MSmits: 13-14 plies, very cool
 MSmits: let me switch to that
 jacek: so may games, so little cores
 jacek: good winter is coming
 MSmits: yeah, i played a move my meta mcts already solved as a loss. 
 MSmits: i just hadnt put it in my book yet I suppose
 jacek: such a disgrace
 karliso: MSmits Is it not better to overtake (2, 3)?
 MSmits: you mean steal? Nah, not for me anyway
 MSmits: it's pretty balanced
 MSmits: so i can win games when i take and when i dont take
 MSmits: but i have somewhat better results not stealing
 RoboStac: I probably should fix my starts at some point
 RoboStac: still hardcoded first move as p1 + always steal as p2
 MSmits: i have had starts with 1 0 and 2 1 as well, they are fine, tric trac does this
 karliso: Are there draws in Y?
 RoboStac: yes, but rare
 MSmits: yes, but rare
 MSmits: nice
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517257222">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/517257222</a> 
 karliso: You are on the same wavelength
 MSmits: apparently&#160;:)
 MSmits: the game might be solved as a draw
 MSmits: to not be solved as a draw, every starting move needs to have a winner
 RoboStac: though saying rare I did draw vs tic 3 times out of 9
 RoboStac: on my last submit
 MSmits: its funny, every game i lose vs you is identical
 MSmits: oh no i found a different one
 MSmits: loss in the same place though
 MSmits: just different losing move :P
 RoboStac: theres 3 - lengths 11/12/14
 RoboStac: though I guess 11/12 are the same but reversed players
 MSmits: could be, also once my bot solved as a loss, it doesnt really care anymore, might take longer sometimes
 MSmits: never more than 1-2 plies, depends if it is a trap or a double 4 in a row
 RoboStac: and the 14 is basically the same except my bot makes you play one extra forced move
 MSmits: ah yeah
 karliso: Wouldn't Y get boring with large opening books?
 MSmits: they aren't exactly large though, mine isnt
 karliso: exactly
 MSmits: 1308 moves
 MSmits: of course rotated for symmetry, so around 15k in that case
 MSmits: i dont think it's boring because I like finding the moves
 karliso: What if someone else approached openings like you and you both pushed each other.
 karliso: Would there still be middlegame left?
 MSmits: hasnt happened, would be interesting
 MSmits:  we almost had something like that in othello with oldjohn
 MSmits: but he stopped
 MSmits: the main thing is that my bot is really strong late game
 MSmits: so i dont have to worry past a certain point
 RoboStac: I imagine mines quite weak due to low sims + not much training data
 MSmits: it's strong early game though
 MSmits: and thats where most wins happen
 Moogs: umu
 MSmits: my meta mcts just said i need to break your triangle robo
 jacek: the shell has spoken!
 MSmits: on my 3rd hex, i somehow decide to place it outside of the triangle area
 MSmits: the mcts has a serious depth problem early game
 MSmits: most of my moves are triangle fixes, often vs dafish
 MSmits: but karliso as for whether it is boring. I like the game itself because of the tactics, traps etc. So I like watching the meta mcts solve nodes and come up with counters. Thats why its not boring
 MSmits: seeing robo wreck me 10x in a row is exciting :P
 jacek: it just sucks seeing bot missing obvious traps and game ending in 11-12 plies
 MSmits: jacek do you think maybe a ntuple bot isnt enough here? I think NN might fare better
 MSmits: traps have odd shapes
 MSmits: you have to have a relation between two 4-patterns to spot it
 MSmits: NN layers do this
 jacek: maybe. or maybe i need other approach to create my training data. the winrate can jump 45%-75% against baseline
 MSmits: you should check how many different games it plays though
 MSmits: it might be deterministic and then the winrate doesnt mean much
 jacek: yeah it was pretty deterministic so i added more random
 jacek: but still its jumping
 MSmits: hm ok
 MSmits: I'm not sure if the starting move might not have a huge effect on the flow of the game
 MSmits: a center start is very different from a corner start it seems
 struct: Is there any move that is always a loss?
 MSmits: you mean, not considering the steal?
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: 0 0 and 2 0 are very weak
 MSmits: I havent solved them though
 MSmits: the +1 hex advantage of player 1 is quite substantial so it compensates the bad start a bit
 MSmits: for example, the 4 4 start is a solved game
 MSmits: but player 1 does 0 0
 MSmits: and then player 2 does 4 4
 MSmits: not solved
 MSmits: even though the 0 0 is entirely out of range
 MSmits: so it seems as if p2 an use the same tactics to win
 MSmits: but at some point that corner hex will generate some threat that prevents the 4 4 win
 MSmits: best counter to 0 0 is 3 3
 MSmits: blocks 4 in a row coming from the corner

 Astrobytes: RyanGilbert: it's already in #clash, up the top on stream notifications, and discord. Please desist.
 RyanGilbert: OK, my apologies
 MSmits: it's ok to say here you're streaming, if you keep it to one message right? Just no posting clash links?
 Astrobytes: yeah totally
 Astrobytes: no worries RyanGilbert
 RyanGilbert: OK cool
 jacek: happy Princess Luna Day
 RyanGilbert: Streaming again to those who were waiting
 Astrobytes: RyanGilbert your stream notification has disappeared
 RyanGilbert: On discord?
 RyanGilbert: hm ok
 RyanGilbert: give it a few minutes probably
 Astrobytes: last one is from about 15 minutes ago
 Astrobytes: yeah, probably just twitch being twitch
 RyanGilbert: any reason for the lag?
 FirstInLastOut: so i'm not alone lagging ..
 TM_Tsukiru: Here too
 RyanGilbert: yeah 
 IamFish: Usually lags around this time. Should get better in like 30 min in my experience

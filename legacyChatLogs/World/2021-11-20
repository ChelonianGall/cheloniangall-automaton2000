 Wontonimo: no and no (imho)
 RandomAustralian: ihdaioshdioashdas
 RandomAustralian: I never see a ruby person in the time based ones
 RandomAustralian: yet as soon as it is a codesize based one
 RandomAustralian: They mAGICALLY APPEAR
 SeanDaSheep: LOL
 Codeab: afternoon Wontonimo!
 Wontonimo: hey Codeab
 eulerscheZahl: good morning
 Wontonimo: :wave: :coffee:
 ZXC01: wow
 ZXC01: you are second!!!
 eulerscheZahl: yes, trictrac got me in the end
 Codeab: sad
 Codeab: common eulerscheZahl beat trictrac
 ZXC01: in what game??
 Wontonimo: overall
 ZXC01: oh
 eulerscheZahl: i still have some games that I haven't even started. just low motivation
 Codeab: lol
 ZXC01: wow
 eulerscheZahl: 20 games already, they are getting more :scream:
 Wontonimo: lol indeed.  "just low motivation" - says 2nd place out of 1 million ranks
 ZXC01: are you in legend in most games?
 eulerscheZahl: there is no legend league without me
 ZXC01: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i used to be motivated. but at some point (especially the board games) it just feels repetitive to me
 Wontonimo: yeah, i echo that.  you have way more staying power than I have.
 Wontonimo: i have been enjoying helping new coders though even though I haven't really done any new multis myself
 Wontonimo: I haven't followed Marchette's tutorial on how to make a NN in CG.  That's still shiny and interesting
 eulerscheZahl: same, i should really read it
 eulerscheZahl: the helping of noobies is another repetitive thing. help one to understand that thor doesn't update the position or how the CSB angle works. within less than a week you can do the same again
 eulerscheZahl: i used to be active on a German comp sci forum and answer questions. that has a bit wider range but also got boring
 Wontonimo: it isn't like stackoverflow where the answer is there to stay and be shared
 rizonbro: uljan
 Wontonimo: so, yeah, it repeats
 Wontonimo: i try to spice it up by not giving the same answer each time
 rizonbro: banned him if he here bannde him ok team works
 Wontonimo: what?
 Codeab: wontonimo im new help me&#160;!&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: yeah, i'm up for it.  what would you like help on&#160;?
 Wontonimo: are you looking for a puzzle?  I could suggest one
 Codeab: i was kidding lol were u sarcastic or wat
 Codeab: ooooh wat puzzle
 Wontonimo: haha ... sorry man.  just checked your rank Codeab
 Wontonimo: you are working on ultimate tic tac toe right
 Codeab: erm ya i dont like it :P
 Wontonimo: why don't you like it?
 Wontonimo: you are very near the top of silver
 Wontonimo: crickets ...
 Wontonimo: :cricket:
 cipwns: Can you debug code here?
 Wontonimo: yes
 Wontonimo: add debug messages
 Wontonimo: add micro tests
 ZXC01: the ones in green
 Wontonimo: use 'asserts'
 ZXC01: to debug:.......
 cipwns: I was doing micro tests and debug messages already&#160;:) Just that it's annoying sometimes 
 jacek: happy Caturday
 humanbeethoven: Hi 
 humanbeethoven: what is going on
 H00n: hey, time to work on my Code Royale bot&#160;:&gt;
 H00n: stuck on place 4... so close yet so far
 MeNinjaHEEheehawpaw: Hi
 BadBob: how is this fun, but somehow it is
 king_akshat: hiii
 DialFrost: *when u struggle with the easiest puzzle "Temperatures"&#160;:|*
 jacek: oO
 H00n: don't sweat it, take some time off and think about something else. Come back at the puzzle at a later point and you might have a better time. Helps for me
 DialFrost:&#160;:| still cant
 PATTRIM: LOL
 Moctrof: Anybody hiring remote .NET dev&#160;?
 Prabah: ha ha
 Prabah: me too looking for freelaunce projects
 giaco: there are other syte as this one?
 eulerscheZahl: there is codeingame.com and codinggame.com if that's what you mean
 jacek: i dont think there are other sites with clashes and escapes like this one
 eulerscheZahl: isn't codewars about clashing too?
 eulerscheZahl: or codecombat?
 eulerscheZahl: i forgot
 jacek: :upside_down:
 AntiSquid: how was reply challenge this year, euler
 Jasmineker: hello world
 eulerscheZahl: reply was fun overall. the coding was easier than last year IMO. we managed to solve all 5 tasks there
 eulerscheZahl: for the rest i was mostly clueless, dready got 2 binary tasks at least
 eulerscheZahl: for coding you had some kind of jigsaw puzzle: lots of pieces each defined by 4 numbers (the edge shape). all edges were unique, which made solving it pretty easy
 eulerscheZahl: then a rubik cube solving task
 eulerscheZahl: and something with captchas. i did them manually as did the top teams who wrote post mortems
 AntiSquid: :thumbsup:
 gb26: prev
 Westicles: two approvals in french for my drug puzzle.  this is a new age of harmony and peace
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: A swiss...
 Westicles: we are all brothers
 Wontonimo: siblings
 Wontonimo: or sisters
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Humans these days...
 Wontonimo: mammals 
 Resizt: Guys, I have an interview assessment coming up soon and I'm really stressed out about it
 GamingGnawer: do you know anything about what they'll have you do?
 Resizt: Just learning about this site and seeing how things are approached from a whole unique side of things, what is a way i can be more familar with this stuff in a day?
 Resizt: yea, its a codingame assessment @GamingGnawer
 eulerscheZahl: do some easy/medium puzzles to understand the platform
 Resizt: its 2 hours in total but seeing these clash of code reverse mode, and crazy algorithms I'm 2nd guessing really hard
 Resizt: @eulerscheZahl thank you, that make a lot of sense
 Roby5791: Who is the first in rank&#160;? (1/2...)
 Roby5791: hii
 eulerscheZahl: Resizt also have a look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/offers/screening/?cg_referrer=%24direct">https://www.codingame.com/work/offers/screening/?cg_referrer=%24direct</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that explains the process from a recruiters point of view but also contains some screenshots of what you will get to see
 Resizt: wow, they can flag your thing for cheating? how does that happen? I wanna avoid that
 Resizt: i have so much background stuff running, idk if that would interfere with the test
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know, just some guessing: repeatedly tabbing away while you do research on the web and copy-pasting code
 eulerscheZahl: at least that's what i can think of, that's possible for a website to track
 eulerscheZahl: you could also search your company on a website like glassdoor. some candidates describe the hiring process
 Resizt: thank you very much
 jacek: oh my
 vaeng: is  	Jian-Yang  the most often picked profile pic?
 Dren: lol this is the first time I've passed all the tests and they give me a 20% after submit
 jacek: oO
 Dren: it was reverse too
 Dren: how am I supposed to figure out a pattern in reverse if the test cases mean nothing lol
 jacek: generalize more :v
 Westicles: which puzzle is it?
 idk.man: yo
 Dren: you get a string and have to map fibo sequence onto it
 Dren: so 
 Westicles: this one?
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/48226e1de9ad86ac7b862e3f8dcac1f863b9">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/48226e1de9ad86ac7b862e3f8dcac1f863b9</a>
 Dren: yeah how did you find it
 Westicles: I searched for aabceh here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 jacek: plot twist: he made it
 Dren: welp with that 20% I was still second xD
 Westicles: you can give bad feedback.  if it gets enough it will be auto-removed
 GER-NaN: For Crystal Rush game, is there a method to detect enemy traps?
 jacek: nope, just educated guess
 3141948: Detect suspicious enemy's activity
 Wontonimo: Resizt :wave: welcome to the platform&#160;!  
 surgutti: hi, how is the checkpoint reaching in csb calculated. is it point point distance after each round or point line in between the collision simulation?
 Uljahn: the latter, it's a ray-circle intersection
 Wontonimo: I just made a new puzzle.  Feels good.  Took it from an old SO answer I gave regarding DFS and turned it into BFS for CG.
 Wontonimo: I rated it as "Difficulty: Medium" because it is a DFS problem.  That feels like a medium to me.  Certainly harder than "The Descent"
 Wontonimo: if anyone here has any rules-of-thumb for difficulty level easy-vs-medium, please let me know
 Wontonimo: mine is&#160;: if/else and possible a loop is 'easy'.  Recursion, DFS, BFS, Minimax is 'medium'.  Tricky or mathy stuff with multiple steps is 'hard' or 'very hard'
 darkhorse64: looks sensible
 Mr.Presqu: hi
 Wontonimo: hey Mr.Presqu, what are you working on?
 Mr.Presqu: I'm on the CodinGame Sponsored
 Mr.Presqu: Reverse
 Wontonimo: oh nice
 Mr.Presqu: Hello Wontonimo
 Mr.Presqu: yes it is
 Wontonimo: without posting any spoilers, how's it going on the reverse game?
 Mr.Presqu: Its quite ok,
 Mr.Presqu: but
 Mr.Presqu:&#160;:)
 Mr.Presqu: one of the "submit" cases fails,
 Wontonimo: weird
 Mr.Presqu: I dont really understand how I can debug these
 Wontonimo: you are talkking about this one right <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/codingame-sponsored-contest">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/codingame-sponsored-contest</a>
 Mr.Presqu: yes indeed
 Mr.Presqu: others have gotten 100% with python so I know its my doing
 Wontonimo: did you look at the hints on the left hand side (the light bulb that has the word "hint" under it)
 Mr.Presqu: hmmmm
 Wontonimo: it kinda spoils it a bit
 Wontonimo: but if you are really really stuck they are great hints
 Mr.Presqu: I mean, all of my IDE tests pass
 Mr.Presqu: ill check the hint thing
 Wontonimo: it's not really about passing the test cases, it is about maximizing your score
 Wontonimo: a higher score means you *probably* understand the puzzle more
 Mr.Presqu: yes, was gonna say
 Mr.Presqu: I don't do gaming code
 Mr.Presqu: so I know-ish how to return proper values
 Mr.Presqu: but I have no idea of what it implements&#160;:)
 Mr.Presqu: ok the hints do help
 Wontonimo: have you figured out what the initial input means and what the input per round means (don't post if you know, no spoilers plz)
 Mr.Presqu: Thankyou Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: no
 Wontonimo: np
 jacek: you cant fail the sponsored puzzle, can you
 Wontonimo: i used a LOT of printing to stderr 
 jacek: a languages achievements fest
 Wontonimo: haha , never thought of that
 Wontonimo: that's cheese
 struct: hi
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 ZXC01: hi
 ZXC01: could you help me with legends of code and magic?
 Nickkname: I feel like there are not many real ppl playing codingame
 Nickkname: Lots of them are bots
 burger4d: yes
 Nickkname: .....
 Nickkname: I thought you are bot
 renanMX255: hello world
 C26_1: Can I ask something
 SmartnessSDA: pffff classic programmer 
 C26_1: What is this kind of method?
 Nickkname: You appear in every single of my clash and leave without completing the code or get 100% right way lol
 Nickkname: @burger4d
 Nickkname: Are you an admin?
 C26_1: I don't have a keyword to search them so I'm gonna ask in here
 C26_1: @Nickkname
 C26_1: Can you help me
 Nickkname: Sure ask
 Nickkname: Hope I can answer
 C26_1: def Password(text): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f6cef76f-ed24-4fe5-a9ed-6edea43866a3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f6cef76f-ed24-4fe5-a9ed-6edea43866a3</a>
 Dren: I hate that CoC doesn't let you work on the code after the time is up
 C26_1: This is the code to make a text to a number, only lowercase letter. I left this as an exercise for all you guys to find a reverse function of that
 Nickkname: Well, first you need to identify if it is reverseable
 C26_1: yea
 Nickkname: Is it?
 C26_1: idk if in programming language there is a way to know if a function is reversable
 C26_1: I'm gonna search
 C26_1: Sadly enough, there's no anwser
 Jerrasterix: you could crack it but will have numerous results
 C26_1: yea
 Jerrasterix: Its a really good hashing algo, you have found i guess
 C26_1: yea
 C26_1: @Jerrasterix
 C26_1: Can I say something to you
 C26_1: I mean you say that my algo is very good but is there a standard table about how a character trranslate to a number
 C26_1: Somethings like ASCII table
 C26_1: Or Unicode table if you can
 NijeByteNo: Hi , I am Okay
 Thorcode: what do assert_equals() do? after a while reading I do not understand about that function
 NijeByteNo: yes
 Nickkname: I just came out a way to identify if your method is reversible @C26_1
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: @Nickkname, I'm so proud of you
 C26_1: Your googling search is better than me
 Nickkname: A true hash function is not reversible if we know sha_256 is reversible, then there will be a way to make sure sha_256 is reversible
 Nickkname: Just find that way and apply the same thing to your function
 C26_1: ok
 NijeByteNo: if you want to win, you musn't loose
 Nickkname: The secret of not dying is being alive lol
 NijeByteNo: Hard statement
 NijeByteNo: I beleive there is never an end

 dbdr: ruining my tats as usual :D
 dbdr: stats
 kovi: same here
 dbdr: me?
 dbdr: you have 100% against me I think
 dbdr: I mean you are ruining my stats, which are fine otherwise
 kovi: i just resubmit to see how perfrom vs. latest
 kovi: oh ruining, sorry i read running
 kovi: too early

 chucknorris: hm wow in my path searching algo the actual path of my player was not set :p no idea how it worked
 AntiSquid: there's lots of "improvements" through bugs because it makes the bot less predictable in a game where it matters a lot
 chucknorris: yeah it made some very unpredictable moves :D which I'd rather call stupod
 AntiSquid: woke up realizing where i had a bug! :p
 AntiSquid: fixted
 Ravi1269: great
 Zandy156: do your bots ever get to the point where they have too many possible paths for the opponent, that it would timeout if it tried to calculate and store them all?
 AntiSquid: Ravi1269 hi, get an avatar, it gives +5% xp bonus
 kovi: chucknorris - unpredictable moves sounds like a feature not a bug
 AntiSquid: most players have a way to prevent the timeout Zandy156
 chucknorris: yeah I'm sure when the opponent was seeing me going into a corner for no reaseon was very surpriesed
 chucknorris: the buggy version worked better on the leaderboard tho :D 
 kovi: told you, its a feature
 AntiSquid: time to check where the bug helps?
 chucknorris: yeah I guess my bot wont consider going into a corner...at all :p 
 AntiSquid: had a weird bug in the tracker that eliminated all possible positions very fast, although inaccurate it often narrowed down correctly to 1 single pos ... wonder if i should add it back in as a secondary tracker 
 thibpat: I'm live again streaming Ocean of Code in JavaScript! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 chucknorris: I like how simans bot is surfacing wheni it's about to get a killing blow, even if it doesn't have to :p 
 kovi: same here
 kovi: the crew enjoying seeing the victory
 emh: hey everyone using my fast BFS. mlomb found critical bugs.. I will try to fix them soon
 Quidome: Strange, if i resubmit I wil drop to the bottem of the list, after complete recalculation. But 10 hours later i am 30 places up. This looks repeatable&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: yes there's a lot of randomness on the ladder
 Quidome: Yes, but I will always clib 30 places in 10 hours or so
 AntiSquid: and some "weaker" bots are still timing out to silence Quidome :p
 Quidome: hm, still don't understand 
 Quidome: But no problem&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: was a joke referring to this bot:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446030261">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446030261</a>
 Zandy156: from what I can tell, timeouts from silence are quite uncommon in gold 
 AntiSquid: chucknorris you timeout
 Zandy156: his doesn't count lol
 chucknorris: yeah thanks. 48ms limit seems to be too high sometimes
 Zandy156: Is it really worth losing milliseconds each turn to prevent a rare timeout? 
 chucknorris: we will see..
 emh: ok guys I updated <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/53455/fast-15x15-bit-grid-bfs-breadth-first-search">https://tech.io/playgrounds/53455/fast-15x15-bit-grid-bfs-breadth-first-search</a> with some critical bugfixes. hope it works better now

 AntiSquid: ugh need a full rewrite, this mess is too ugly
 ZackGabri: hia infinite tundra
 AntiSquid: hello new people

 Alexzz: codeclash is broken for me
 Adn_coder: samme
 21stCenturyPeon: Interim fix: refresh the page when the clash has started, and it will load the IDE page properly
 ItachiEU: Hey guys, anybody had the problem that opponent_orders = input() in python3 was giving you timeout?
 yfprojects: How do you know? @ItachiEU
 wlesavo: ItachiEU use flush = True while printing to stderr
 wlesavo: and you will see the debug messages after input
 ItachiEU: oh, thanks a lot!
 mark7: What strategy you guess use to choose what power up to recharge?
 Valdemar: just torpedo,silence,mine
 Valdemar: it's better to have it in that order for me
 AntiSquid: sonar seems really bad
 mark7: okay!!
 MadKnight: m'kay
 AntiSquid: fix your bot MadKnight
 MadKnight: improve your bot AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: get into gold MadKnight
 TekeCode: Hi, in clash of code, the countdown reached 00:00 and the screen didn't transition to the IDE, After leaving the challenge I recieve an error 504, the clash already started, someone knows how to solve it?
 mark7: what happens if we give comand like this "MOVE W MINE | SILENCE W 1"
 RajeshBilla: i faced the same thing
 Quidome: first time in top 100 in gold. Me very happy :D
 TekeCode: congratss
 mark7: congrats  :thumbsup:
 Quidome: pfff, everyone is getting better all the time ....
 Quidome: :P
 mark7: how many players are there in gold?\
 Quidome: 165
 mark7: wayy less than silver
 mark7: 440 in silver
 AntiSquid: mark7 12:54PMwhat happens if we give comand like this "MOVE W MINE | SILENCE W 1"what do you mean?
 Quidome: What your question Mark7?
 AntiSquid: you move to W twice 
 AntiSquid: or you mean from opponent's perspective?
 mark7: My opponent used "MOVE W MINE | SILENCE W 1" and my tracking system crashed
 TekeCode: no answers for 504 clash error&#160;?&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: then you don't track correctly
 mark7: I should split action by | and then process them in turn
 mark7: Right now its hardcoded to to check silence  first
 Quidome: Yeah that would help
 Quidome: Order is very important
 AntiSquid: yay timeout
 mark7:&#160;?
 TekeCode: Still having 504 error, someone else?
 mark7: let me check
 mark7: could you join
 Quidome: 504 where?
 Quidome: uh, 504, gateway timeout
 Quidome: everything is working fine for me
 Quidome: So it's probably a problem near you at not near the server
 AntiSquid: you can always click discord chat button at the top and write about your issue on discordor even CG forums TekeCode
 Ravi1269: do I need machine learning to ocean of code
 AntiSquid: no, but it sure gives the impression that it's a contest meant for ML practitioners
 AntiSquid: fix your bot MSmits
 MSmits: lol...
 21stCenturyPeon: Hey, Clash Of Code is working again
 MSmits: why?
 AntiSquid: why is clash working again?
 YannT: since late silver this contest is pretty much france vs. hungary (and wlesavo as the outsider :D )
 YannT: oh wait no siman is from japan, so that too, it's a very wordly contest
 MSmits: it's always France vs the world :P
 MSmits: btw, took a couple days break to fix some uttt and do some work. Back now&#160;:)
 MSmits: I wanna try to at least get legend
 MSmits: Fixed my suicidal mine-triggering just now
 YannT: you'll be happy to know that I did find one game (out of a gazillion) where double mine laying from one spot turned to to cost me a win :p
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: that's annoying
 MSmits: the worst thing is when something almost never happens, but still rarely does and it is a lot of work to fix it
 YannT: yeah that one occurence is not sufficient for me to code around it yet
 MSmits: then when you fix it, it doesnt help you much at all
 YannT: it it happens more we shall see&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah
 YannT: what's more problematic is my bot having the heart of a suicide bomber and going like SURFACE|MOVE|SILENCE|TORPEDO when it's not even a killshot
 YannT: I can't tell if that's a problem or it's actually my edge :p
 MSmits: it's hard to tell anything. This game has a strong meta-related component
 MSmits: what is your edge now, could be your weakness later
 YannT: well given my current results I'll just assume it's a good thing :D
 MSmits: I'm just trying to code everything, that is *sure* to help and save the meta related things for later
 YannT: I have like one more feature idea, and then I'm down to just tuning constants
 MSmits: ahh ok. Well there's 2 more weeks to go...
 YannT: yes, maybe new ideas will come...
 YannT: I started out with a TODO list of like 20 big pucture items, down to the last one
 MSmits: try not to go too crazy on it. I remember wasting 2 whole weeks on locam 
 MSmits: after my bot was pretty much done
 MSmits: even on vacation i was down in the lobby of my hotel frantically trying to think of improvements&#160;:)
 YannT: locam lasted way too long, by the last week all bots were just stagnating
 dbdr: what rank did you finish at locam MSmits?
 MSmits: 5th
 MSmits: but it was at the high end of a large number of players with pretty much the same rating
 dbdr: nice
 MSmits: 3-20 I think
 YannT: everybody was out of ideas or unwilling to do the necessary rewrites from scratch
 dbdr: I wonder how OOC will look at the end
 YannT: it's half as long as locam, shouldn't have the same issues
 dbdr: similar or not, hard to predict
 chucknorris: I expect something like in tron, but with mines
 MSmits: Locam I had an almost perfect playing bot I think... the playing wanst the problem. The difference was in the draft and I could not get a handle on that
 dbdr: half?
 MSmits: it's just as long
 MSmits: not half
 YannT: one guy did a statistics analysis for draft and everybody pretty much latched on to that as I remember
 dbdr: you can't say it's perfect playing, unless you add assumptions
 MSmits: thats right YannT
 MSmits: dbdr yes, what I meant is, i had a full search, trying all action combinations
 YannT: everybody just had static coefficients for draft that were either taken directly from ClosetAI, or established using the same method, which would give the same results
 dbdr: only to a given depth
 MSmits: for 2 plies even, with more plies not helping
 MSmits: because, no information
 MSmits: noone was able to make that work
 YannT: locam was solvable
 dbdr: deeper is harder, but not theoretically impossible
 MSmits: sure, i am just going by the fact that noone managed to
 dbdr: more plies would help with infinite compute power&#160;;)
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: top 2 was still above the rest, no?
 MSmits: yes, but just because of draft
 MSmits: the nr 1 did hundreds of thousands of sims
 mark7: Is there a way i can filter matches in which i timeout? trying to fix some buds 
 mark7: bug*
 dbdr: and changed at the last minute?
 MSmits: no he was at nr 1 for 2 weeks
 dbdr: because draft could be copied otherwise
 MSmits: it was somewhat flexible i think
 YannT: you couldn't know what was in your opponent's hand so I'm pretty sure no one did that, it was just about 1) drafting (getting your coefficients right) and 2) essentially trying out all of your turn's combinations (which if pruned correctly was solvable in the time given)
 MSmits: re curse also had a slightly flexible draft
 MSmits: but mostly constant order
 MSmits: YannT yeah i think my bot solved a turn 1 out of 200 or so. Sometimes you had 6 creatures with a hand with many improvements and charge creatures. In that case it sometimes missed solving 1 turn
 MSmits: 199 out of 200 i mean
 MSmits: the calc time was 1 ms 1 ms 1 ms, 95 ms, 1 ms 1m setc.
 YannT: yeah me less, that's why I was only 33, less optimized, that's really what it came down to (since we all had  close enough draft)
 dbdr: and people with MCs has 95ms 95 95 95 ...
 dbdr: wasting power
 MSmits: haha yeah, MC would work just as well I guess, if you can fully  search 1  ms, 95 ms would lead to near perfect play using MC
 MSmits: though pruning would still help a MC bot
 dbdr: better, theoretically, since MC will have noise
 dbdr: but MC would be better if you can't be exhaustive
 mark7: what is MC?
 YannT: well MC would imply bruteforce, the trick was to prune combinations that "make sense"
 dbdr: unless you can have a good heuristic order
 YannT: you could
 YannT: it's what brings the number of combinations to try down and make it solvable
 dbdr: Monte Carlo mark7
 dbdr: trying random moves
 MSmits: yeah, most important was probably the attack order. If you know two creatures can kill another together and the order doesnt matter, then only consider one order
 mark7: thanks
 MSmits: usually I did left to right
 YannT: there was some trickery with spell orders too
 MSmits: yeah that too
 YannT: and summoning
 MSmits: that shielding ability lead to some branching
 MSmits: but other than that, an attack spell should be handled the same when it comes to ordering
 YannT: it only made sense to summon first charge creatures
 YannT: all other summons better be done at the end
 YannT: things like that
 MSmits: unless the board is full
 MSmits: then you need to attack first
 MSmits: technically, there could be several phases
 MSmits: every time you attack, make room, place more charge creatures
 MSmits: those were the turns where my pruning broke down and I used the full 95 ms
 MSmits: super rare ofc.
 TekeCode: hey, I already solved my problem
 MSmits: Hey YannT, I dont see you much outside of contests. Do you ever do multi's here in between?
 TekeCode: thx to all &lt;3
 YannT: MSmits: not a lot, I got into UTTT at some point but other than that I just submit my contest bot into the multi when that comes up&#160;:)
 YannT: I do puzzles sometimes! haven't finished all of the official ones yet (almost)
 MSmits: ahh ok. Well it's pretty hard to keep up with all the multi's anyway. I certainly don't manage to.
 MSmits: About half I think
 YannT: UTTT piked my interest because I was curious about MCTS
 MSmits: Yeah, I am working on it a lot again these days. 
 MSmits: and mcts is super useful in most community multi's
 YannT: maybe I'll rewrite it in Go from Kotlin one day to get some of that performance boost
 MSmits: wow, you have one in kotlin!
 MSmits: that's ballsy :P
 YannT: yeah, my objectif was to  push a Kotlin bot to legend :D
 YannT: did that
 YannT: objective*
 MSmits: that's pretty hard
 YannT: it leaves very little wiggle room to beat the gold boss that's for sure
 YannT: the exact same bot in a different language would probably perform a lot better
 mark7: will JAVA work?
 YannT: well yeah I proved that (Kotlin is Java under the hood)
 YannT: it's hard tho
 YannT: dbdr proved it even better (but it's not an MCTS)
 mark7: okay, I am gettin g timeout in silver when opponent just use silence and nothing else
 YannT: oh we were talking about another multi
 YannT: in this you can definitely do it in Java
 mark7: okay
 YannT: performance is really not that much of an issue (which doesn't mean you don't have to optimize your code, but language really isn't a limiting factor)
 YannT: one of the top bots is in Python
 mark7: What you do guys do if multiple path  for opponent result in same cell?
 YannT: keep the paths
 mark7: What if it results in more that 5k
 MSmits: mark7 this problem occurs mostly when an opponent does chain-silence
 MSmits: I would suggest you prune at this point
 MSmits: Keep at least 1 state for each possible current position for the opponent and prune the visited cells
 mark7: ohh! I can do that!
 YannT:&#160;:)
 mark7: And also reset their previous paths
 mark7: Thanks
 MSmits: dont have to reset completely
 mark7: :grinning:
 YannT: once you climb higher in the rankings, it's less of an issue (because people will start to mine instead of silencing a lot)
 MSmits: if an opponent visits a cell in every path, then just keep that cell as visited
 MSmits: pruning also becomes a major pain with mines
 MSmits: so its better that it almost never happens&#160;:)
 mark7: Okay
 MSmits: also, if you want to prevent it entirely, just blow some mines
 mark7: Or, use sonars
 MSmits: or that, but blowing stuff up is more fun
 mark7: Hell yeah
 mark7: :joy:
 YannT: in the lower leagues I did well with just torpedo + sonar and very little silencing actually
 YannT: because silence is 6 charges and sonar is 4
 MSmits: yeah I guess that works, but not just because of the charges thing, also just because sonar reveals 1/9th of the entire map and silence just moves you to like 12 cells max
 MSmits: i'm pretty sure that chain mine blowing will do just as well
 MSmits: except it reveals your position :P
 YannT: also if your opponent's bot is coded to silence when is reveal is getting high, he'll spend 6 charges to resilence immediately while you spend 4 to resonar him when he resilences
 YannT: you get time for mines, he doesn't
 mark7: I still confused in which powerup to recharge, right now
 YannT: his reveal*
 mark7: torpedo 100&#160;% chance
 MSmits: mark7 I havent even coded that right yet
 YannT: well that's a strategy choice mark7&#160;:)
 mark7: 80% silence
 mark7: 80% mine
 MSmits: I wouldnt just do&#160;% though, make it depend on some kind of info
 mark7: else silence
 MSmits: right now, I charge torpedo when it is not charged, then I charge mine when it is not charged and otherwise i charge silence

 MSmits: it's not a problem because i almost never launch a torpedo... so i will end up mining a lot anyway
 Liftyee: mining away
 ZarthaxX: smitoooooo
 MSmits: AntiSquid dont you just love how c++ lets you do that
 MSmits: I had the exact same problem
 MSmits: hi Zarthy
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 MSmits: everything good here, did another online class today, went well
 MSmits: did some live modelling. And I know that doesn't sound like what i mean
 ZarthaxX: my mom is doing an online conference with teachers now
 YannT: AntiSquid: well then clearly don't fix it :D
 ZarthaxX: lmao :P
 mark7: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 MSmits: yes, i modelled someone throwing a ball up in the air
 ZarthaxX: or of your physical body :P
 MSmits: no no :P
 ZarthaxX: like the youtube video?
 MSmits: yes, same program, only I did it on google meet
 ZarthaxX: i see
 MSmits: so the student could ask questions while I am doing it
 MSmits: 21 of them on. the whole class, noone excepted. It's cool. the students are really perfect students these days, as far as i can tell
 MSmits: they do their homework, all attend etc.
 MSmits: ZarthaxX is your mom a teacher and is she in a meeting with her colleagues or is this a teacher conference with like 100+ teachers
 ZarthaxX: nice..
 ZarthaxX: she is having a tutorial with other teachers
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: we have those too. I didn't attend any though
 ZarthaxX: im curious a how you have all perfect students
 ZarthaxX: as*
 ZarthaxX: ahhaa okey
 ZarthaxX: they are just saying how to use google clasrroom
 ZarthaxX: classroom
 MSmits: these are 17 year old students of the highest level, they are bit more motivated probably
 MSmits: yeah we have those too, google classroom, google meet etc.
 ZarthaxX: i woudl say the opposite really
 MSmits: some teachers have 0 knowledge on this
 ZarthaxX: when they are close to graduating they get super lazy
 MSmits: ah yes, but these have another year to go next year
 ZarthaxX: i gguess argentina sucks then :P
 ZarthaxX: ah ok
 MSmits: that's when they will get lazy
 ZarthaxX: yeah that may be their peak
 MSmits: and that is indeed my experience
 ZarthaxX: and u got them
 MSmits: also even these guys are lazy usually. It's just that they know I will call their parents if they dont do the job :P
 ZarthaxX: i have the students that just got to secondary school
 ZarthaxX: haahahah
 ZarthaxX: you have that authority :P
 MSmits: I do, except when they turn 18
 ZarthaxX: well i have that too i guess, but no marks
 MSmits: I still have the authority to call *them* though
 ZarthaxX: i dont have a way to pressure them with marks
 MSmits: ahh  i see
 MSmits: well this is computer science isnt it?
 ZarthaxX: my space is different
 MSmits: your subject I mean
 ZarthaxX: robotics with arduino but it's something you choose to do
 MSmits: ah yes
 ZarthaxX: of many options they give u , you get to do 3
 eulerscheZahl: we don't know yet how strong the boss will be
 MSmits: i noticed the motivation is far stronger for CS related things, than for my own physics related stuff
 eulerscheZahl: oh, chat scrolled
 ZarthaxX: we were going to do more programming in the beginning
 ZarthaxX: it may be stronger yes..
 MSmits: hi eulerscheZahl the frogfish
 eulerscheZahl: that's a hypnoshark
 MSmits: ok
 ZarthaxX: at least what i noticed when i did my first class introducing stuff is that kids were dying of boredom
 eulerscheZahl: so, your CG motivation is higher than your IT security motivation?
 ZarthaxX: until i say, guys grab the computers to see this introduction part and test ti yourself
 ZarthaxX: and everyone was like yeeeeeeeees
 ZarthaxX: hypnoshark?
 ZarthaxX: is that from futurame
 ZarthaxX: congratz
 eulerscheZahl: not futuramafound it on the internet, don't ask me where
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl you really always seem to find the right art. You perfected the skill of finding free art to complement your coding
 MSmits: onitama is a good example
 eulerscheZahl: this one might be a copyright violation, i don't know
 YannT: were you googling for dead fish drawings?
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: but Onitama, true.that one was public domain

 Nagatwin: nice mine stacking
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: Robo knew you were going there
 Nagatwin:&#160;:'(
 MSmits: it's a trap!
 Nagatwin: and I gracefully felt into
 MSmits: yep
 Nagatwin: im supposed to have some pathfinding to avoid mines
 MSmits: you mean you should, or do you?
 AntiSquid: why did he expect you to go there and why did you go straight there? :D
 MSmits: if you do, better tweak a constant :P
 Nagatwin: Yeah xD
 Nagatwin: Sounds like I went in for the mines
 MSmits: AVOID_DYING_IN_CORNER = 0.7f
 MSmits: better make that 0.9f
 Nagatwin: Let's tune that magic number
 AntiSquid: so what is robo's algo? mine every cell in the corner to make it more appealing to suicidal bots?
 RoboStac: I've no idea why it did that
 Liftyee: can you surface and move at the same time
 Liftyee: ie surface move n
 MSmits: thats how good your bot is Robo. It's emergent behavior
 YannT: ahah
 YannT: building mine sastles in the corner
 MSmits: yes Liftyee
 YannT: castles*
 Nagatwin: Let's become cautious
 Nagatwin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446141898">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446141898</a>
 RoboStac: ah, looking at debug it thought the only area without mines was that top left area
 RoboStac: so tried to stay there
 Nagatwin:&#160;:,)
 RoboStac: and since it just spams mines as much as possible it did that
 MSmits: well... it worked&#160;:)
 Nagatwin: Yeah my algo tries to maximise the doubt over the first 30 turns
 MSmits: when in doubt, maximize
 AntiSquid: i see so naga's bot is braveheart 
 Nagatwin: nd after turn 30 or so
 Nagatwin: It goes crazy and I loose everything
 YannT: then maybe maximize for all turns&#160;;)
 MSmits: time for some blue facepaint
 Nagatwin: YannT Yeah I tried but can't afford the same test amount when I have a lot of paths
 Nagatwin: Like, because I maximise doubt, I minimize the amount of simus I can do early on
 MSmits: maybe combine the path info into 1
 MSmits: then search
 Nagatwin: My path structure does not allow that&#160;:(
 kovi: wow, robo is top10 now
 MSmits: that's probably the least suprising thing :P
 YannT: wala came in at like 20% push and has +2pts on everyone I was like well shit, but it's going back down now :o
 MSmits: he's always in there if he tries to
 wlesavo: wow, robo in top10 already, grac
 Nagatwin: looks like tuning that number got me back into top 30 with my whole code refactorized 
 Nagatwin: Gotta plug a brain into the code now
 MSmits: good
 Nagatwin: 3 ifs is not enough&#160;:/
 MSmits: hah no
 YannT: double the number of ifs, double the brainpower
 Nagatwin: :D
 Nagatwin: Any of you have some ressources on how to handle the multiple actions per turn for a simu&#160;?
 YannT: I have 40 ifs in my entire code, that's how much brain I put in
 MSmits: not me Nagatwin
 Nagatwin: Im more curious than anything, I don't think that I can afford doing a simu there I'm too slow
 YannT: + 6 switches, that's like doublebrain of an if too
 MSmits: simu is a very broad term. You don't actually have to simulate all future possibilities
 MSmits: just simulate parts of the game to make informed decisions
 MSmits: like your mine avoidance
 Nagatwin: I wish I could do a full simu on this kind of games tho
 YannT: Nagatwin: establish combinations of orders that "make sense" according to some heuristic (to trim down, otherwise the combinatorial value is insane) and then simulate that
 MSmits: what YannT said
 Nagatwin: Anyone thought of some kind of markov chain to make up this heuristic&#160;?
 Nagatwin: I have not enough budget for MCTS I think
 YannT: the heuristic is basically "comon sense" based on the game rules (and somewhat on strategy decisions that you make)
 Nagatwin: ok right
 Nagatwin: Now the question is
 Nagatwin: should I implement sonar :p
 chucknorris: its possible to use mcts in this contest naga :p 
 Nagatwin: Yeah I know
 Nagatwin: But I feel like my simu's count is too slow to get MCTS running
 Nagatwin: I could maybe afford a greedy search at most
 AntiSquid: is sonar useful? seems really bad
 MSmits: seems so to me as well, but who knows
 chucknorris: I personally hate that spell
 chucknorris: very boring
 Nagatwin: Top players seems to be using it
 Nagatwin: Still haven't even implemented it in my code
 AntiSquid: maybe only for bots who lay all their mines in a corner?
 Nagatwin: :D

 Nagatwin: I reached paranoia I guess
 AntiSquid: that pathing doesn't seem right
 Nagatwin: Im avoiding potential damage
 Nagatwin: Sounds right
 Nagatwin: tuned a 100 to 100000, that was the wise advice of MSmits
 Nagatwin: (he said 0.7 to 0.9 but w/e :p 
 mark7: I can beat rank 2 but still my rank is 420 in silver why???
 Liftyee: why is surface move N not working
 Liftyee: like it surfaces but doesnt move
 Nagatwin: mark7 you probably have a bug or loose against other players
 Nagatwin: Liftyee SURFACE|MOVE N should work
 mark7: Nagatwin you in gold?
 Nagatwin: Yes
 mark7: could you share a replay of our bots fighting?
 emh: how often does bulls and cows 2 ranking update?
 Nagatwin: bulls and cows&#160;?

 Nagatwin: mark7 ^
 Nagatwin: emh oh idk
 mark7: Probably i have a bug, I timed out in some games
 Nagatwin: but the leaderboard is frozen since 4pm or so
 Liftyee: thanks
 emh: ah now updated
 wlesavo: nice emh
 chucknorris: emh the original python version is buggy too&#160;? 
 chucknorris: of your bfs
 emh: chucknorris yes it was ported from C++ to python
 icecream17: time for school....
 icecream17: that loading screen sentence is amazing
 mark7: online?
 2571540: Can't find it ehm
 emh: Nagatwin ehm or emh?
 emh: find what?
 Liftyee: can you charge all things in one turn
 mark7: no
 mark7: you can only charge one thing
 emh: btw thanks wlesavo&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: ehem
 AntiSquid: what does emh stand for?
 emh: just my initials
 AntiSquid: oh
 emh: eivind magnus hvidevold
 Liftyee: ok#
 AntiSquid: i'll probably forget that and ask you again in a year
 emh: hehe
 MSmits: just remember Magnus
 MSmits: Probably the coolest Norwegian name
 emh: thanks&#160;:)
 dbdr: is it from latin or a coincidence?
 emh: not sure
 2571540: Haha my spellcheck got me emh&#160;:( found it, it was the bfs playground
 emh: oh hehe ok
 accorp: Eivind&#160;:) sounds elvish
 emh: hehe so much attention for my name today
 MSmits: maybe Elvish sounds Norwegian
 emh: Elvish is alvisk in Norwegian
 Nagatwin: games against myself are weird

 dbdr: I suspect my bot has a very kind bug
 dbdr: if it's leading, it tries to help the opponent catch up :D
 wlesavo: so you teaming up with opponent against ocean
 dbdr: something like that&#160;:)
 wlesavo: i guess covering all the water with trace could be counted as a win against nature
 RanN42: i have a problem in ocean of code, when i fight the boss i don't get timeout but when i submit against players i get timeout a lot how does it possible?
 manmanman: Maybe the other players trigger something that takes more time, might help to write the time it's using to the error log
 RanN42: what do you mean by write the time it's using to the error log?
 nerosiar: heyu
 manmanman: Apart from commands you send for your turn you can also write logging to the error log, what language are you using?
 RanN42: python
 RanN42: i found out that the torpedo takes too long against players for some reason
 rwilson: RanN42 i'd take manmanman's suggestion&#160;;)  ...   add some extra console outpuf for debug.  Capturing the runtime of certain functions can be quite helpful ( espectially for python )
 RanN42: ye i just don't understand why the same "find torpedo path" function takes more time against players
 MSmits: maybe because you don't know where they are?
 manmanman: Probably a  specific usecase, which doesn't occur often against the boss.
 rwilson: Could be a lot of things. Players are all over the place in terms of 'legal', but the boss is pretty predictable.. 
 MSmits: ohh vs the boss
 MSmits: yeah the boss is a specific player, he may play a certain way
 rwilson: example:   Boss might ALWAYS move, but players might sit still &amp; only shoot when that's legal.
 RanN42: ye i guess i will go over my code agaub
 manmanman: Question from my side: is there a set order in silence/move. Or is it the order of the commands
 MSmits: comamnd order
 MSmits: a &lt;&gt; m
 rwilson: command order , as in the order the player played the commands.
 manmanman: Ok, thanks
 mark7: how so guys decide where to go
 MSmits: so far all I got is -&gt; dont go to where the mines are
 MSmits: oh and try not to get stuck and be forced to surface to reset 
 mark7: how do that not being stuck, I am stucked there
 MSmits: floodfill
 AntiSquid: 3:2 MSmits
 MSmits: whats that AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: my wins vs your wins, last battles
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: I'm just messing around, trying things. I am not even avoiding mines atm
 MSmits: also not doing much with strategy/logic
 eulerscheZahl: 1.47
 AntiSquid: well i just have bugs MSmits
 MSmits: ah... dont think I have those atm. But i just lack many features
 <b>**mark7 slaps MSmits what if enemy put mines on third move wouldn't it mess up? around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/18213950997435" /> Nagatwin: thats violent
 MSmits: yeah, that hurts
 mark7: Oh I didnt mean that
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: sure, enemy would mess up your moves
 MSmits: just try to make some assumptions
 mark7: shit
 mark7: hot to mention someone
 mark7: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: write the name
 eulerscheZahl: mark7
 eulerscheZahl: hint: you can tab-complete: eu[tab] =&gt; eulerscheZahl
 Nagatwin: eulerscheZahl
 Nagatwin: :o
 MadKnight: Nagatwin didn't know that&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't know that either?
 Nagatwin: no 
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Nagatwin: That nick of yours
 eulerscheZahl: my nick must have been a nightmare to you
 Nagatwin: Even worse
 Nagatwin: you can't imagine
 eulerscheZahl: so, when others call me "euler" for short, it's because they don't know tab completion?
 Waffle3z: elurezsehlza
 Nagatwin: could be
 mark7: MSmits I meant this
 muy31: What happens if people have simlar names tho?
 mark7: Still didnt work
 eulerscheZahl: then you tell EugenioToshiAmato to change his nick. He's ToshiTuringMachine now
 Waffle3z: hazelhercules
 muy31: ToshiTuringMachine
 muy31: doesn't work
 muy31: :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: he's not onilne
 muy31: oohh :upside_down: :astonished: :open_mouth:
 muy31: no me know
 mark7: eulerscheZahl should work?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Nerchio: how to see my response time?
 rwilson: Nerchio, as in how long you spend on your turn?
 Nerchio: yea i mean some of my turns are skipped because they take too long probably
 Nerchio: but i am not sure
 AntiSquid: then you would get timeout instead, no turnskip
 rwilson: if you take too long the referee will make you lose with 'Timeout!'
 eulerscheZahl: i never noticed the watermarks in MSmits' profile pic before :D
 ayucaba: i'm on discord who wants to join

 florinpop17: you are live!
 florinpop17: say hi to my followers!
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to stream a little longer, joining the contest might be an option for you
 florinpop17: I have a private contest going on :D 
 mark7: Hi youtube!
 AntiSquid: 1 win vs siman, my bot is complete <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/446209822">https://www.codingame.com/replay/446209822</a>
 AntiSquid: ezpz Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i need a little help
 Nerchio: is my league ranking updating only when i click submit?
 eulerscheZahl: do you have a bot in the arena already?
 eulerscheZahl: then it's possible that other play against you on their submit. in that case your rank can change too
 Quidome: @Nerchio, noi
 Nerchio: yea it's winning almost every game in wood league but I don't advance in places very fast
 Quidome: also when others do a commit
 dbdr: the ranking updates only every few minutes
 eulerscheZahl: the leaderboard got even slower?
 Quidome: @Nerchio, your recalculation is not finished 
 dbdr: it's been minutes for a long time
 Quidome: You can see progress in the leaderboard
 Quidome: as well by last battles
 Nerchio: is discussing strategy here allowed or not really?
 Quidome: Please do
 dbdr: it is
 eulerscheZahl: no code sharing
 dbdr: ^
 Quidome: I saw a nice piece on bitboards...
 eulerscheZahl: i realized that i take too much damage by mine explosions
 Nerchio: more like, do you guys use floodfill to see if it's worth going somewhere?
 dbdr: yes
 Quidome: me to, but only just 5 minutes ago\
 Nerchio: I just started and made my bot shoot and move in random directions but need to ramp it up a little bit :P
 Quidome: made it to gold without :D
 eulerscheZahl: do you have an opponent tracking Quidome?
 Quidome: Yes sure
 Quidome: That did the most for me
 eulerscheZahl: (curious how far people get without)
 emh: dbdr how did you get first place in Bulls and Cows 2?&#160;:) many submissions with different random seeds?
 dbdr: I needed to get out of wood 2 :D
 Quidome: That thing wasn't easy though
 dbdr: emh not that many, I optimized the stats
 eulerscheZahl: emh the random seed of your solved doesn't matter, as the server has random validators
 emh: ohh
 eulerscheZahl: my average result (tested offline) is about 316 with 290 as the best
 emh: ok
 dbdr: I had a 276 offline. I suspect it's not representative to pick random numbers to guess
 dbdr: because of the fixed answers
 Nerchio: when I hover over your avatar it says you are first in something eulerscheZahl 
 Nerchio: is it the current league?
 eulerscheZahl: but still helps to see if you are getting better
 dbdr: he's the first in everything :D
 eulerscheZahl: global leaderboard Nerchio
 dbdr: global rank
 Nerchio: I will be in wood1 soon
 Nerchio: catching up to you guys
 eulerscheZahl: kovi only places 2.6 mines per game and triggers 1.53 mines. yet he deals 0.81 damage with it :o
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile i spam 18.21 mines, trigger 2.5 and cause 0.9 damage
 kovi: nice stats
 Quidome: How do you make these numbers?
 eulerscheZahl: downloaded thousands of replays :D
 Quidome: Aha, nice work :D
 kovi: btw i have changed triggering today
 Piemert: how am I suddenly in gold? o_O
 eulerscheZahl: i use agent 2759044 for your bot
 Quidome: NIce work Piemert
 Piemert: luck? was stuck at place 20 - 30 @ silver
 eulerscheZahl: downloaded at 17:07 CEST
 Piemert: didn't change a thing
 Piemert: or all better opponents improved and also promoted...
 kovi: must be around that euler, cant tell for sure
 feinophet: How would i use the debug message to pass The Descent?

 eulerscheZahl: kovi not sure if you fixed that already: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/445889881">https://www.codingame.com/replay/445889881</a>at frame 41 you charge a mine despite it's fully charged already
 eulerscheZahl: you do 0.31 invalid charges per game in the replays that i analyzed
 kovi: oh, that is few days old, thx
 eulerscheZahl: for comparison: some players have 0.0, the highest are wlesavo (0.81), YannT (1.97) and ValGrowth (2.87)
 mark7: did you calculated that or statistics is shown somewhere? eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: i analyzed 3000 replays offline
 mark7: Ohhh Man! :thumbsup:
 wlesavo: wow, now thats a commitment
 eulerscheZahl: i also know which player uses silence how often and what the preferred distance is
 manmanman: Weird, I think I would be in the top of the ranking with useless charging :stuck_out_tongue:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/okSMUUO">https://imgur.com/a/okSMUUO</a>rest of the stats and maybe some CSS after the contest
 eulerscheZahl: i only analyzed top players
 mark7: eulerscheZahl playing smart to win
 manmanman: Ah, ok
 wlesavo: nice, looking forward to see it after
 eulerscheZahl: there are definitely some differences in player strategies
 kovi: i battle barehanded....
 kovi: so barehanded that i havent touched vs for a few days....just found a type mismatch bug
 eulerscheZahl: i see you submitting quite often?
 wlesavo: hm, with some lucky submit back to #3, thought it was already imposible, my bot didnt see improvements for quite a few days
 eulerscheZahl: i just hope for legend now :D
 kovi: lately i submit after every serious change
 wlesavo: euler same here :slight_smile:
 AntiSquid: anyone else getting very big differences in rank between submits?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 kovi: not today afternoon
 1998marcom: Q: Does compile-time have any kind of constraint generally? Is it included in the "First turn time limit" or is it in a separate account?
 AntiSquid: one TS user remaining above me, almost reached the main goal
 wlesavo: AntiSquid well i got pushed out of top ten and after resub got 3, so yeah
 AntiSquid: you're py3 user
 ayucaba: i'm on discord
 AntiSquid: amazing
 ayucaba: just noticed you are moderator
 1998marcom: @AntiSquid In fact because of time constraint I may fall back to C++
 AntiSquid: good idea
 RoboStac: 1998marcom - compiling isn't counted as first turn
 RoboStac: but there are limits on it
 AntiSquid: C++ is generally faster though go for it, but there's a python3 in top 10 1998marcom
 1998marcom: Thanks @RoboStac, do you know where can i find those limits?and @AntiSquid,
 kovi: good old top siman, wlesavo and me
 1998marcom: probably there are many strategy computationally feasible via py3, but mine it's not :sweat_smile:
 wlesavo: kovi did you change much last couple of days?
 1998marcom: Congrats kovi, siman and wleslavo!
 kovi: wlesavo - today there were quite improvements and a few serious bugfixes
 wlesavo: 1998marcom the trick is not to compute much when you know little about your opponent
 AntiSquid: 1998marcom not sure which limits he was referring to, ping him again 
 DEIZ21: you guys rock
 DEIZ21: make the task harder
 DEIZ21: i just joined the gold league
 DEIZ21: have a long way yet
 AntiSquid: nice
 aangairbender: do you use any minmax-like algo? I mean bruteforcing enemy move and your reaction move?
 DEIZ21: are  you all using floodfill as basic moving algo?
 aangairbender: I used Smitsimax in pokerchiprace, but here it's not easy to come up with such algo
 AntiSquid: maybe you could still do it when there's only 1 possible enemy position? or just a few 
 DEIZ21: i dont think minmax would be easy to use here since its more for complete information games
 DEIZ21: am oi wrong?
 AntiSquid: the enemy doesn't stay hidden forever
 DEIZ21: within 50ms, i doubt
 DEIZ21: if the depth is poor i dont think it ll bring something good
 AntiSquid: you got gold, surely you have a good tracking algo
 1998marcom: @wlesavo I'm actually trying to compute as much as possible while trying to avoid timing out, I would guess it's more of a matter of what i am computing to find the opponent - i am playing without sonar and mines, and without looking where i shot; @RoboStac do you know where are the limits on compile time written?
 AntiSquid: or did you mean the charge count for each skill as reamining hidden info?
 DEIZ21: AntiSquid, i track almost every thing, damage i deal damage the enemy deal, surface,  movements... yet i see better tracking than me
 DEIZ21: the charge only matter foor torpedo i think
 DEIZ21: so rest when opponent fire
 DEIZ21: and than consider it fully charged 3 turn after or 2 if he moved after firing in the  same turn
 AntiSquid: ah damn didn't add a charge count estimator to my TODO list @_@
 DEIZ21: me neither
 DEIZ21: until now
 DEIZ21: but its on the agenda&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: now all you need is an avatar!
 DEIZ21: its a simple tweek to decide you go near a far the opponent
 DEIZ21: hhh
 DEIZ21: actually i'm quite happy i reached the gold
 DEIZ21: it's my first bot, never experienced this before
 AntiSquid: good rank too
 DEIZ21: if i can reach legend no matter the rank i would be glad
 wlesavo: AntiSquid there is not much to estimate, just be pessimistic and count 3 turns for torpedo and another 6 for silence

 ZarthaxX: what is that contest
 ZarthaxX: im confused
 Quidome: upcoming Pacman
 daffie: I was talking more about the whole time he was blocking pb4 from touching checkpoint 3 and 2
 daffie: but good thinking adding it to IDE thanks

 RockyMullet: oh:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/446262695">https://www.codingame.com/replay/446262695</a>
 AntiSquid: hi RockyMullet long time no see
 RockyMullet: hi&#160;! :D
 RockyMullet: yeah didnt realize before yesterday there was a special contest in progress
 Astrobytes: Ocean of Mullets!
 RockyMullet: I should make a new avatar for this one
 RockyMullet: I though maybe an actual mullet, like the fish, on the canvas
 Astrobytes: A mullet is a type of fish so yes, a mullet with a mullet?
 RockyMullet: yeah would be pretty meta
 Astrobytes: Would also work yep
 AntiSquid: there's a mullet in the ocean chasing a shark fin
 eulerscheZahl: RockyMullet getting the priorities straight: first the avatar, then the bot :D
 RockyMullet: actually, I have messed up my prorities
 RockyMullet: im silver, without a new avatar
 RockyMullet: a new avatar is what I need to get into gold
 eulerscheZahl: ping chucknorris
 RockyMullet: he'll roundhouse kick my avatar, I see
 eulerscheZahl: some homework four you 446260232 446258531 446257839 446255424 446254269 446253844 446252432 446251632 446247089 446244480 446243363 446241219 446240705 446237812 446237652 446229537 446229424 446226287 446222653 446221996 446220289 446220083 446218797 446208006 446206199 446205041 446202544 446201488 446200861 446200370 446200111 446199806 446197626 446197445 446196923 446194947 446194199
 Astrobytes: I guess I should have change nick to Hydrobytes or smth
 AntiSquid: lol what's that
 RockyMullet: hum, what am I looking at&#160;?
 kovi: timeout?
 wlesavo: seeds i guess
 eulerscheZahl: if chucknorris falls into the water, he won't get wet. the water will get chucknorris
 eulerscheZahl: replay IDs with crashes
 wlesavo: oh i see
 eulerscheZahl: a lot of them for 247 matches
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo with 0 in 147 matches
 struct: more than 10%
 struct: quite big
 AntiSquid: i thought chuck norris would do push ups on water, not fall ...
 eulerscheZahl: RoboStac and YannT have some as well. but not of that scale
 RoboStac: yeah, I need to up the amount of mines I allow
 eulerscheZahl: bit encoding?
 AntiSquid: make a circle of mines around the opponent
 kovi: didnt know that helps crashing&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: robo crashes: 446258823 446253091 446251633 446248768 446245303 446224419 446207291 446150495 446145065 446142812 446139442
 wlesavo: well i didnt change much since i cleared out most of bugs
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo you have 0.93 invalid charge actions per game
 Nerchio: every turn you get information what your opponent did last turn yeah?
 kovi: this is an interesting game, new and new ways to win by forcing enemy crash
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl yeah, i meant timeout type bugs :slight_smile:
 RoboStac: yeah, they all appear to be mine limit issues
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/446241491">https://www.codingame.com/replay/446241491</a>around frame 244. but you can't do a valid charge :D
 Vrexu: did someone say cpt. haddock (*cough* *cough* *mines* *cough*)?
 eulerscheZahl: i should spam even more mines against robo
 RoboStac: it's usually me who breaks the limit I think
 kovi: btw...if i have killing combo i may randomly recharge something...so that doesnt count&#160;;)
 RoboStac: didn't print which player exceeds it
 wlesavo: euler, wow, thx
 eulerscheZahl: Vrexu has corona, put him in quarantine  
 kovi: robo: i had my own eval cutlimit an order of magnitude lower than enemy
 eulerscheZahl: i do the same kovi
 eulerscheZahl: checked it, only invalid charges in my kill turns
 wlesavo: in mine there are some in kill turns for sure
 kovi: royale is coming
 wlesavo: the game is on
 eulerscheZahl: was just a matter of time for royale to join
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still waiting for Neuman n
 eulerscheZahl: and kawano
 eulerscheZahl: and where is Magu s?
 _Royale: I did not expect such a change, I just adjusted one parameter for my SILENCEs.
 wlesavo: euler could you also analyze 1st vs 2nd difference, if it is not much of a problem for you
 eulerscheZahl: hm, should be doable...
 kovi: that would be interesting
 struct: with same seed right?
 eulerscheZahl: 1489 1454 6
 eulerscheZahl: p1 p2 draw
 wlesavo: no, i mean just an average, should be more representative
 wlesavo: hm
 wlesavo: interesting, thx
 eulerscheZahl: i have a 2nd dataset:1429 1411 7
 eulerscheZahl: crashes are removed from that stats
 kovi: that is minimal but probably representative
 eulerscheZahl: if there is an advantage for p1, it's small enough not to require mirror matches i think
 MSmits: also if there is an advantage for p2
 MSmits: because it could be either way 
 eulerscheZahl: my stats imply p1 advantage
 kovi: yeah, definitely no need for mirror match with that
 MSmits: nah, they don't eulerscheZahl, the difference is too small to tell
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 eulerscheZahl: but i already got blocked from using the API temporarily
 eulerscheZahl: too many requests
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.codingame.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /services/Leaderboards/getFilteredChallengeLeaderboard (Caused by NewConnectionError('&lt;urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7f341c128990&gt;: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 113] No route to host'))
 eulerscheZahl: just because i used 50 parallel connections&#160;:(
 MSmits: that seems harsh
 eulerscheZahl: but got 1k replays in under a minute
 Astrobytes: Hit &amp; run
 wlesavo: yeah, testing in the ide i sometimes had the feeling of advantage for the first player, but occasionally its not relevant, thats good
 chucknorris: wow thanks eulerscheZahl. thats a lots of timeout
 eulerscheZahl: fix it
 eulerscheZahl: or don't, you are above me
 kovi: oh, the duck also coming...
 MSmits: donald?
 ZarthaxX: lmaooo
 kovi: but teccles said, he will not join
 MSmits: sad
 AntiSquid: well you need to be crazy to join this one
 MSmits: was this a requirement?
 kovi: and still no sign for recurse and karliso on the leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: that means nothing
 AntiSquid: you pinged them both kovi
 AntiSquid: also karl submitted on the very last day in CR2
 eulerscheZahl: it was UTG
 AntiSquid: CR2
 eulerscheZahl: UTG
 AntiSquid: crystal rush!
 eulerscheZahl: good night
 AntiSquid: bye
 MSmits: gn eulerscheZahl
 ZarthaxX: cya toad
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446278055">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446278055</a>
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 struct: mine hunter
 MSmits: has anyone had any luck with picking a better start location?
 MSmits: I tried 3 ways, full random, just anywhere with a lot of room to move, or in a secluded corner. I see no difference in performance
 AntiSquid: doesn't seem like the most important 
 MSmits: well it seemed easy to code
 MSmits: low hanging fruit and all that
 MSmits: might be that I don't see a difference because my bot isnt good yet
 rwilson: MSmits - early games definately felt like it mattered ... after wood league, not so much.. 
 MSmits: maybe if you have good mine avoidance, starting in the middle is more of an advantage
 wlesavo: MSmits i tried to predict others choosing start location, failed misserably, turn out people dont really care for a start, or care in a way i didnt tried to predict
 MSmits: ah ok wlesavo, but mostly what I was asking, say noone knows where you start, what then is a good position?
 MSmits: i dont really care about the predictability of it
 struct: Hard to say imo
 rwilson: wlesavo - lots of corner pickers early on.... makes for easy floodfill.
 wlesavo: people were discussing of how many turns you can stay hidden from a certain possition
 struct: might be a good choice, but also depends on opponents
 MSmits: that probably depends a lot on how you move after you start
 MSmits: and what you do
 wlesavo: exactly, so shouldnt really matter that much
 MSmits: hm ok
 wlesavo: so i gave up on that
 MSmits: So, back to full random then&#160;:)
 chucknorris: well...it matters
 MSmits: if you dont know which way it matters, then it doesn't matter :P
 MSmits: this piece of wisdom brought to you by
 MSmits: /me
 wlesavo: i mean it could matter if you trying to control your territory by mines, but i dont know if many people doing that already
 icecream17: when should i shoot? when there are 20 possible positions?
 wlesavo: 20 to much
 MSmits: how would you even "control your territory" you cant go to the same place twice
 MSmits: unless you surface
 wlesavo: surface it is
 MSmits: surface is a good choice when you project you will die without it
 MSmits: or just get more damage without it
 wlesavo: you have to surface once or even twice a game in average
 MSmits: yes, but i suspect there are situations where you dont wait until you run out of room
 MSmits: you'll know when you enter a minefield
 wlesavo: all the top basically doing that to escape mine
 MSmits: yeah
 wlesavo: minefields
 MSmits: makes sense
 wlesavo: so yeah, battle for control of a territory is real
 icecream17: but wait, if the opponent silences a lot then the opponent will just through the mines
 MSmits: yes, but what is control really. I don't see how it has an easy definition here
 MSmits: not like in a typical strategy game
 wlesavo: icecream17 end you will eventually endup surrounded by mines
 icecream17: no, i'm a mine person. the silence person goes through my mines
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/445995926">https://www.codingame.com/replay/445995926</a>
 MSmits: if you have enough mines up, it pays to just blow one up every turn
 wlesavo: MSmits well most of replays i see it is pretty clear who controls what, at leaast in this meta
 fingerdash: does someone know how clash of code points work&#160;?
 MSmits: yes, but it's not real control when it's not intentional
 wlesavo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446274471">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446274471</a>
 wlesavo: im talking about going from unintentional to intentional
 MSmits: arent bot subs just trying to avoid mines
 MSmits: both
 MSmits: note to self: get mine avoidance soon
 wlesavo: yes, but how many space you have to move is kind of control
 MSmits: sure and I guess some maps give you some nice chokepoints
 wlesavo: most of longer games looks like that
 MSmits: it looks nice
 MSmits: makes it seem like a real game, unlike the early games
 MSmits: silence doesnt help you much in that case either, it seems
 MSmits: except to get to chokepoints faster maybe
 wlesavo: yes, but so is mine spaming in your controled territory
 MSmits: most of those mines are pretty useless though
 MSmits: i mean, if you've got stuff walled off... 
 MSmits: he can never get deep into your mined territory anyway
 wlesavo: but they give you safe space to move, so not exactly useles
 MSmits: yeah, the walling off part is useful
 MSmits: you're right
 MSmits: the mines in the bottom left corner dont do much
 MSmits: but i guess thats a feature of this map really
 MSmits: most maps dont have islands configured like that
 Nerchio: can you start with torpedo command and the do move?
 Nerchio: just asking cause i need to know how to search in string
 MSmits: you can do either first
 MSmits: the order is free to choose
 Nerchio: so it's safe to assume that if i find "move" in string then the char is going to be just after that right?
 MSmits: space separated
 MSmits: but do it like this
 wlesavo: Nerchio you have to split string first
 MSmits: first split strings with "|"
 MSmits: then split strings with " "  (space)
 MSmits: the first item of that second split is always the order
 MSmits: then the second and third are the details you need with the order
 Nerchio: makes sense thanks!
 rwilson: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b7373d11-cae9-4c0d-be4d-0a037ad5f6ab">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b7373d11-cae9-4c0d-be4d-0a037ad5f6ab</a>
 rwilson: lol ..  chat doesnj't like embeded newlines
 rwilson: anyone have a 'feeling' for what the current split is on types of bots for Oceans of Code?  Full Sim/Eval bots   vs
 YannT: I t hink most top bots are bruteforce sims (with heuristic pruning /. strategy choices)
 YannT: I don't think there's any proper fancy pants alkgorithm being used (yet)
 AntiSquid: i am calling my algo fancy pants then
 Vrexu: bruteforce is fancy
 wlesavo: AntiSquid you have to get to the rop first :wink:
 wlesavo: i mean top
 YannT: dude don't dare him there's enough fight in the top5 as it is
 AntiSquid: my goal is to get above the typescript bots
 AntiSquid: then i will try to get some motivation to get legend
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid should've used D obvs
 AntiSquid: maybe i promote to legend and if there is no typescript i switch to D even with broken submit/ default code
 AntiSquid: screenshot it and message the typescript users
 YannT: didn't they do a thing so people can't do this anymore
 Astrobytes: lol
 wlesavo: what the matter with typescript?
 YannT: if you switch language you have to pass leagues again
 AntiSquid: eh?
 YannT: so people can't cheat the first in language achievement
 AntiSquid: no idea
 AntiSquid: but i already have the 1st in a lang achievement
 wlesavo: AntiTypeSquid
 AntiSquid: was 1st in JavaScript
 MSmits: ouch
 MSmits: you had to type a whole bot in that language
 YannT: since ES6/TypeScript it looks surprinsgly like a proper language now
 YannT: that you can actually work with
 AntiSquid: ES6 and TS aren't the same though
 YannT: I know that, I'm saying both of those together make JS into a growup thing&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: "propoer" language, it wasn't created for the same purpose as the others and it's a different language, it doesn't have to be like the others
 icecream17: wait, js is bad?
 AntiSquid: TS ruins it for me
 AntiSquid: no it's not, these people are haters, don't listen to them icecream17
 MSmits: haters gotta hate
 AntiSquid: lots of companies will look for vanilla JS icecream17
 icecream17: yeah... but i'm not thinking about compainies
 icecream17: *companies
 AntiSquid: when you work on your own JS is fine as it is
 icecream17: i see
 AntiSquid: for larger groups of people TS might be preferred, because it introduces aspects from other languages
 icecream17: i've never heard of TS
 icecream17: oh, typescript?
 AntiSquid: it's javascript with unnecessary and ugly add-ons
 AntiSquid: yes that one
 icecream17: i don't know the first thing about typescript
 AntiSquid: sorry, not my topic of interest, was just saying i want to rank higher than the TS folks
 AntiSquid: something to keep me motivated to participate
 MSmits: beating me 3:2 is not enough?
 icecream17: Well, i'm still in silver....
 AntiSquid: that was a pile of bugs that beat you MSmits
 MSmits: good&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i remove the bugs and i land bottom of gold :p
 AntiSquid: i need to rewrite and i am too lazy
 MSmits: I usually get beaten by bugs
 MSmits: usually they're my own bugs but still
 MSmits: I'm lazy too.... I need to write a proper search with mine avoidance
 MSmits: I suspect that would throw me into top 30 at least
 icecream17: i'm amazed by this website. i've never written more than 1000 lines of code before
 Vrexu: what do you need 1000 lines for?
 icecream17: just a number not the important part
 inoryy: would be curious to track lines of code written over a lifetime
 icecream17: lines_of_code = person{987519857190587958759871}.fact{8734256487561598767}
 MSmits: as long as I dont have to look at it. My older code is even worse than what I write now
 Astrobytes: inoryy I still can't get used to seeing your country flag as UK :D
 Nerchio: If i don't submit for a while then it means my bot stops playing and i need to submit again right?
 icecream17: can you exponentiate in js?
 Astrobytes: pow()?
 AntiSquid: **
 Astrobytes: Oh it has that now
 Astrobytes: nice(r)
 AntiSquid: ES-whatever new version they keep adding has it
 Astrobytes: Ah OK
 AntiSquid: they keep adding new things, i am behind with the latest updates
 AntiSquid: icecream17 are you interested in JS&#160;?
 icecream17: my bot is made out of js....
 AntiSquid: ah, i thought you were keen on doing JS projects
 icecream17: Only language I know
 AntiSquid: do you know about freecodecamp&#160;? big community (at least it was years ago) with lots of different projects to build
 AntiSquid: icecream17 if you know JS you can do Python easily if you try ...
 icecream17: what should i know about Python
 icecream17: that must be a hard question to answer,  nevermind
 AntiSquid: it's easier to code in Python
 AntiSquid: i think
 icecream17: rly? huh. what languages do you know AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: i used a few, but that enables one to use other similar languages, so ...
 struct: only need to know D
 icecream17: D?
 struct: D language
 Astrobytes: Yeah, D == C**C
 struct: But im joking icecream17
 struct: I dont recomend D
 struct: I never tried it thoug
 icecream17: Uh-oh. x + ' ' + y + ' xy' = -Infinity
 AntiSquid: ok the reason D is good is because of the performance and the fact that it's a scripting language
 AntiSquid: overall it's far superior to typescript if you want "real" language
 AntiSquid: syntax might seem odd at first, but that's with any new language you try 
 icecream17: wow there's C and D). What other languages are there?
 Astrobytes: I've only played with D (lang) a little, seemed a bit clunky. ymmv
 Astrobytes: E, F, F#, R
 Astrobytes: And more 
 icecream17: Hmm, I could make my own language if I knew what to put
 icecream17: maybe
 Astrobytes: glhf
 AntiSquid: icecream17 idk:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages</a>

 icecream17: I tried that one it's pretty cool
 2571540: That's bf optimization
 icecream17: I didn't optimize that much

 inoryy: Astrobytes yeah, I'm not still not used to having moved either&#160;:) the timing was perfect though...
 inoryy: one not is extra in there*
 Astrobytes: inoryy lol :DAnd yeah, impeccable timing. How are things down there?
 inoryy: well, Boris is in ICU so there's that
 Astrobytes: Yes, saw that a few minutes ago.
 inoryy: I live in a dense region so shopping is a bit of a challenge
 Astrobytes: What area are you in?
 inoryy: King's Cross
 Astrobytes: Oh nice. Yes dense indeed. Great under any other circumstances.
 AntiSquid: i managed to find toilet paper btw&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Also inoryy, one could argue dense in both senses, given some of the local characters :D
 AntiSquid: the shelves were almost empty, but at least i got one package
 inoryy: haha
 inoryy: I had the chance to see its natural state during the summer while I was here for internship, I really liked it
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid loads of it here now, just not in the supermarkets. So if you don't mind ripping your a*se with cheap prison-grade TP you're good!
 AntiSquid: there were all types, just 2-3 packs each
 Astrobytes: Yes inoryy, it's awesome. Despite all the negativity London is a great city to live in
 inoryy: had to raid waitrose 3 days in a row at 8am to get some tp
 Astrobytes: Haha, waiting for the doors to open since 6am
 AntiSquid: if you ever do home deliveries from supermarkets, waitrose is the worst in my experience, best to use ocado instead (they also sell waitrose products, but don't give completely stupid replacements)
 Astrobytes: You can opt out of replacements
 AntiSquid: then you get nothing, they told me they were out of stock for 3-4 different items i wanted
 AntiSquid: never had issues with ocado
 Astrobytes: I got sent f*cking juniper berries instead of allspice once. Lesson learned
 AntiSquid: well waitrose does the dumbest replacements 
 Astrobytes: That was Sainsbury's actually iirc, my bad.
 icecream17: (befunge thing) hey! you didn't say division by 0 wasn't allowed....
 MSmits: earlier today i got stuck for a while because my function that was supposed to return an integer, didn't return anything =/
 MSmits: c++ makes me feel like a noob
 struct: Why didnt it return anything?
 struct: no return at all?
 Envious: whats up guys
 Envious: do you guys know if these problems are leetcode easy?
 Envious: brb
 Astrobytes: Doesn't VS warn you of thta MSmits?
 Astrobytes: *that
 AntiSquid: well you either declare it as void, so returns nothingor you have the function on it's own
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/446326363">https://www.codingame.com/replay/446326363</a> ... finally my pathfinding is working as well
 AntiSquid: int f() {}
 AntiSquid: valid
 AntiSquid: does your pathfinding have anything specific? 
 blasterpoard: AntiSquid well, it avoids mines
 MSmits: Astrobytes apparently not =/
 Astrobytes: Hm, swear it used to warn you
 Astrobytes: Perhaps only for certain return types/cases, :shrug:
 MSmits: yeah... I might have some settings wrong or something
 AntiSquid: heh now the game looks more like tron (in that replay)
 blasterpoard: tbh the thing I just wrote might rank quite high in tron
 Nerchio: is torpedo cooldown the amount of power you have or not I am confused
 rwilson: turns left till you can use..   
 Envious: whats up guys
 rwilson: 0  = you can shoot it now
 rwilson: ... turns ---  if you charge every turn that is.. 
 Nerchio: btw how do some people do such good tracking without hitting something first ;o
 blasterpoard: Nerchio most people are just bruteforcing it
 blasterpoard: looking at all the paths the opponent could have taken
 rwilson: 1st step, simple path tracking...  i.e. if you go East 20 times in a row, then there's only a few places that can 'fit' on the map.
 Nerchio: damn long way ahead of me
 Astrobytes: Phew. Loads of refactoring done, can finally read my code again. gn all
 struct: gn
 Envious: kokokok
 AntiSquid: Envious what are you up to?
 DEIZ21: Hey guys whats up
 DEIZ21: any idea about how to avoid opponent mines?
 rwilson: DEIZ21 are you tracking possible enemy paths?
 DEIZ21: yes
 rwilson: then you might try what i've heard some others doing&#160;;) ( i don't bother yet ) .....  
 rwilson: map the mins with probabilities of a sort... 
 rwilson: if they placed a min on turn 7, then for all your paths, go to turn 7 &amp; mark your map with all the locations they COULD put a mine
 DEIZ21: yes i have this idea of probability but  it sounds very  abstract to me
 rwilson: lots of ways... simplest is just to have a map of INTS    every time a spot COULD have a mine placed .. increment... 
 rwilson: build a sort of 'heat map' of danger
 DEIZ21: thx&#160;;)
 DEIZ21: but
 DEIZ21: the qurstion isnt about how to store 
 DEIZ21: data
 rwilson: i don't think it's the best way IMHO, but it's a fair bit easier than tracking the mines with full logical reasoning ... 
 DEIZ21: actualy it is how to avoid mines
 rwilson: if you're using any sort of scoreing for chosing your next MOVE, then look at your danger map and choose lowest danger
 DEIZ21: nop just a imple fluidfill
 rwilson:&#160;;) then just add to that once you can get a rough idea of danger... 
 DEIZ21: ok thx&#160;;)
 rwilson: choose movment that has MAX( floodfill score - danger score )
 DEIZ21: ok ill need to normalize data then
 DEIZ21: thx for the tips
 rwilson:&#160;;) or hack it... 
 AntiSquid: nice lead, is that different from the version i just won against? pb4
 DEIZ21: i think to avoid mine we need to look little bit far ahead
 DEIZ21: not just one move
 DEIZ21: to evaluate the danger
 YannT: he's tweaking constants
 YannT: I'd say that's working ahah
 rwilson: for example,  my bot had something like that at some point...     flood fill was just locations visited ...  other criteria was distance...      just added good coefficients to get the priority i wanted ..
 kovi: gratz pb4
 DEIZ21: rwilson got it
 rwilson: DEIZ21 - you can do 1 move if you're ok generalizing ...  i.e.   only look 1 step, but calculate your danger  like a point on the map ... say , average of all possible mine locations 
 DEIZ21: thx
 AntiSquid: YannT, just checked, i still win that game, bugs &gt; pb 4
 DEIZ21: i m wondering if it doesnt worth it to make surface and go home where i have a lot of mine
 YannT: ahahah
 pb4: aie
 pb4: 5 loss
 YannT: doubt it&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: doubt what?
 pb4: 7 losses in a row&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: that my bot is bugged? or that i can write competent bugs?
 DEIZ21: where we can see win rates guys
 DEIZ21:&#160;?
 pb4: AntiSquid what do you win against me&#160;?
 YannT: that you can write competent bugs that beat pb4's current bot

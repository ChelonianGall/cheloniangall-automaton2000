 MACKEYTH: Um, google better, I guess? cmath is the name of the library you want, but math.h is the file you need to include.
 MACKEYTH: Sorry, git gud isn't a helpful response, but that's how I found it
 Wontonimo: i thought that was pretty funny "google better"  lol
 Mishaaargh: yeah the example i pulled up said #include &lt;cmath&gt;
 Mishaaargh: hard to be reasonable when you're in the middle of a timed challenge aha
 Dorak: This week's puzzle is insane. :disappointed_relieved:
 Wontonimo: it's "hard" with a 31% success rate.  yeah, it'll be difficult
 Zmatical: hey, hope y'all are doing weel
 Zmatical: very new around here ngl
 MrZee: This week's puzzle makes me realize I really need to take some refresher trigonometry courses lol

 Mush95: Yo, someone know how to detect which is your side In fall Chanllenge&#160;? I'm stuck in wood my bot dont know how to brew in other side &gt;&lt; (cz of spell id) :D
 BugKiller_328: ng
 derjack: does the side matter?
 Mush95: for me yes, i need to know which side to use right spell, not the enemy one. Mb i'm searching in a wrong way
 Stilgart: derjack: it does, some of the spell's id are not the same

 ninjadip: is there a limit to queue container in c++?
 ninjadip: trying to do the roller coaster challenge, everything passes but the 'working with large dataset'
 ichuusy: hi
 ichuusy: what's up 
 ninjadip: nvm
 ninjadip: it's a time issue, need more optimization
 ninjadip: Wontonimo what is this memorization technique? re: roller coaster
 ninjadip: i don't see how looking up a table of what 4+4 is is faster than doing the math
 Blokops: it stops you from doing the math over and over again
 Blokops: try doing this one first, is a easier use of memo
 Blokops: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/the-grand-festival---i">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/the-grand-festival---i</a>
 ninjadip: oh thanks
 ninjadip: just saw this
 ninjadip: will look into it. i'm on roller coaster now. seems easy  other than this part
 Wontonimo: for rollercoaster i didn't use memorization
 Wontonimo: instead i used modulus.  look for a repeating loop and just do the math
 Wontonimo: c++ can do the modulus and multiply to solve test case 6 in less than 1 millisecond.
 ninjadip: HOW CAN it do that??
 ninjadip: like if the pattern that goes on the ride the same? don't add up the people&#160;?
 Wontonimo: yeah, add up the people
 Wontonimo: here is another hint written in python
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b2c54ea2-9b75-4b52-8e37-a2a7a4a9f2a4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b2c54ea2-9b75-4b52-8e37-a2a7a4a9f2a4</a>
 Wontonimo: ^^ that example reduces a loop into a modulus
 Wontonimo: it has to be a repeating loop though
 struct: or solve it in js and you can brute force it
 Wontonimo: :scream:
 ninjadip: hey just saw your messages, Wontonimo, reading them

 Blokops: Wontonimo IS CANADA!!!
 Blokops: i had my suspicions 
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: what?
 Blokops: indeed
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i  walk for 10 mintues and this is what  i see

 BlaiseEbuth: Why riots? No more maple syrup?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i feel if i walk away for another 10 mintues you guys probably have your own country
 ninjadip: so he is all of canada? or u mean candian
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: it's both
 ninjadip: there is some new about maple syrup i heard a week or two ago. about how they are having to go into their maple reserves and maple syrup prices have gone up
 ninjadip: news*
 BlaiseEbuth: The price of the maple syrup barrel is burning! :scream:

 5DN1L: BlaiseEbuth refers to the achievement you can get if you solve the same puzzle in clojure
 ninjadip: whats that
 5DN1L: another programming language
 ninjadip: i get more points for doing the same puzzle in another language
 ninjadip:&#160;?
 5DN1L: yup
 jacek: if you do one in C, you can get C++ for free
 BlaiseEbuth: (yup)
 jacek: ee*
 ninjadip: oh
 ninjadip: i never do C
 BlaiseEbuth: Took some time to got it...
 ninjadip: just c++ and python and java in school

 NotForrest: where do you guys go to do like c++ golf puzzles?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: "time to break code and eat food, and im all outta code" -bobo
 Astrobytes: NotForrest: there's code golf on here in the multiplayer section, there's stackoverflow codegolf community, OneLoneCoder has some nice golf challenges (all challenges are golfable iirc)
 Astrobytes: (last one is on Discord)
 BlaiseEbuth: Found this some time ago, but didn't tested yet <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://code.golf/">https://code.golf/</a>
 Rebollo: guys enum at the end can be a "ALIAS" and behind the scenes a INT at the same time right?
 Rebollo: Why I cannot perform like:
 Rebollo: c++
 Rebollo: enum Direction&#160;: int { UP = 0, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT };
 Rebollo: Direction d = LEFT;
 Rebollo: Direction a = d - 1;
 Astrobytes: int a = d - 1 would work
 Astrobytes: or you could cast the rvalue to type Direction
 Rebollo: but then a need to reassign to Direction again
 Astrobytes: Point is, you're mixing types here
 Rebollo: Because i want to change to right
 Rebollo: if left
 Rebollo: and to up
 Rebollo: if down
 Rebollo: ANd son on
 Rebollo: wihtout doing ifs
 struct: Direction a = static_cast&lt;Direction&gt;(d-1);
 Astrobytes: I showed you how the other day
 Astrobytes: with your array of dx and dy
 Astrobytes: The enum is only to key into the dx/dy arrays and to instruct your object which direction to move
 Rebollo: Yes but U used two arrays
 Rebollo: One for each dimension
 Rebollo: I want to do
 Rebollo: enum Direction&#160;: int { UP = 0, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT };
 MACKEYTH: Hi all!
 Rebollo: int dir = (d+2)%4;
 Rebollo: so I can change LEFT
 Rebollo: RIGHT
 struct: check what I wrote
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/bizitehexa.cpp">https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/bizitehexa.cpp</a>
 Rebollo: same rule
 Astrobytes: that's what I sent the other day struct
 Rebollo: true
 Astrobytes: but yeah, as I said initially about types and as struct showed with the cast, there's your answer
 Rebollo: sorry
 MACKEYTH: Any tips for tightening up a Monte Carlo search algo? I'm stuck at #1 silver in UTTT.&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Object* ob = new Object();obj-&gt;move(LEFT);obj-&gt;move(RIGHT);etc
 struct: which language?
 MACKEYTH: Java
 Rebollo: c++
 Rebollo: sorry
 Rebollo: lal
 Rebollo: worked
 jacek: silver already? gratz MACKEYTH
 struct: MACKEYTH do you allocate the nodes you will need at the start?
 struct: or is this not possible in java?
 Astrobytes: flat MC struct
 struct: ah
 MACKEYTH: I'm creating nodes for just the first generation of possible moves, then running sims using primitives and arrays.
 jacek: are they entirely random?
 MACKEYTH: I'm running them evenly for each move.
 jacek: i mean the simulations, the moves inside simulations
 MACKEYTH: Thinking I should implement a UCT-like choosing method that does more sims for high-scoring moves.
 MACKEYTH: Yeah, rollouts are completely random, no heuristic.
 jacek: simulations could be more intelligent: for example if there is a winning move, make it. also if there is a winning small board move, give it more probability to be chosen
 Astrobytes: well at each depth you are evaluating anyway so the next depth will be based on last best move no
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 MACKEYTH: It's simple MC, not MCTS
 struct: I think its time to learn a new algo
 MACKEYTH: Not building a tree beyond the immediate possible moves.
 Astrobytes: are you doing complete games or just to depth n?
 struct: maybe you can try minimax first but its not ideal for uttt
 MACKEYTH: Complete games.
 Astrobytes: ah cool
 Astrobytes: and you're still only getting a few 100 sims?
 Astrobytes: or did you fix the GC issues?
 Astrobytes: (I missed the rest of last nights discussions)
 MACKEYTH: No, it's doing a lot better now. About 10k sims on an open board, over 100k near endgame.
 MACKEYTH: Seems like it's not performing as well as it should for those numbers.
 Astrobytes: ah cool. Well, I'd add some simple heuristics as jacek suggested earlier
 Astrobytes: before trying anything else
 Dobbertstz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d2d47e08-be10-4848-9a36-7b4ee66b3125">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d2d47e08-be10-4848-9a36-7b4ee66b3125</a>
 Dobbertstz: whoops, did not mean to do that. did'nt think it was that long either&#160;:
 Astrobytes: all good. It's an optimisation issue if you fail on the extra large testcases usually,
 jacek: have you tried the forums <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/tan-network-puzzle-discussion/23">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/tan-network-puzzle-discussion/23</a>
 Dobbertstz: problem is i do find a route, just does not seem to be the optimal one
 Dobbertstz: I could think of a puzzle using a 'backroad' relatively far from the start but with a very small distance to the end (A* should solve this), hence the question here. But I'll look at the forums first. Thanks anyway!
 Astrobytes: there's not usually any discouragement of particular algorithms unless explicitly stated btw
 struct: jacek you use minimax or mcts with your NN?
 Dobbertstz: That's the answer I've been looking for. Jacek's link is spot on btw, thanks!
 jacek: mcts
 struct: thanks
 jacek: my first trials with NN were with minimax
 Dobbertstz: If anybody is interested, I too swapped my lats and lons. Thanks again for pointing me in the right direction, I'll head straight to the forums next time! 
 jacek: :tada:
 Astrobytes: forum first, then chat if you're still stuck, usually works&#160;;)Glad ya got it sorted!
 derjack: hmm my 1-ply minimax is enough to be in top silver in UTTT
 struct: with nn eval?
 derjack: eeyup
 MACKEYTH: How does your nn eval work?
 derjack: it takes board as input, and withing hidden layers magic it outputs probability of winning of the board for the player
 derjack: its just more sophisticated evaluation function
 Astrobytes: Succinct explanation&#160;:)
 struct: easy enough
 struct: writing the code atm
 Astrobytes: nice!
 MACKEYTH: How did you teach it the magic?
 jacek: via self-plays in alphazero-style
 MACKEYTH: How many generations did it take to develop your current eval logic?
 jacek: that got me top 5. i was curious how strong is the eval itself
 struct: I bet you can get legend with mcts 2ms
 struct: per turn
 jacek: hmm dont remember, but usually its around 50-100 iterations
 jacek: 10k-20k games per iteration
 jacek: getting right inputs for NN in UTTT was/is quite a hassle
 MACKEYTH: I don't have a really solid grasp of NN.
 jacek: my purer mcts bot would be around top 20-25 i think now
 MACKEYTH: Overall, or in Silver?
 struct: overall
 struct: you dont need NN for top 10 most of the time
 Astrobytes: though NNs are definitely becoming prevalent in board games at least
 struct: if you cant write an eval write a NN
 struct: problem solved
 jacek: UTTT is still most about mcts and speed
 struct: i have like 100x the rollouts dbd has on bt
 struct: but we are the same rank
 struct: maybe he uses different algo or something
 jacek: or hes trolling
 struct: true
 struct: 10k seems low
 struct: or w/e he has
 jacek: or different counting. in pure mcts i report generally 10x less rollouts than others yet im at their level or higher
 struct: how many did you have?
 jacek: hmm for bt i never used vanilla mcts
 struct: I used at the start
 struct: my arena one has 400k turn 1
 struct: with dynamic depth on rollout
 struct: with no eval and full rollout until game is over
 struct: I have 1M on first turn
 jacek: oh my
 struct: not fully random rollout though
 struct: capture 7th row piece if its possible
 struct: I think thats the only thing thats added to it
 jacek: win/loses 3-4-plies too?
 struct: no just if there is a piece on 7th row
 struct: my arena version is old
 struct: fully random its closer to 1.8M since the rollouts are way shorter
 struct: but i rolllout all children
 struct: this also affeects the number
 struct: its jsut checking if there is a piece on the 7th row and its the player turn to move
 struct: to check for win
 TimberStalker: Why cant c# have a normal modulo operator
 struct: it does?
 TimberStalker: Doing modulo on a negative number in c# gives a negative number as a result, rather than looping it around to a positive number.
 Wontonimo: you can then just add the modulo then modulo again
 Wontonimo: or if you are certain the number will be greater than -modulo to begin with, then (num+modulo)%modulo

 KHRISTO: I thought coding would be easy
 KHRISTO: By The Way, What code do you use?
 Wontonimo: probably a good idea.  if you don't reach expert level and beat people who have 20 years experience in less than 1 hour it isn't for you
 Wontonimo: joking aside, i love coding.  started when i was 8
 KHRISTO: How old are you now?

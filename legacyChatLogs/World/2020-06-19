 Reksio: Thank you for your answer. This is good to hear!
 Reksio: I have two more questions for whomever knows and would be kind enough to answer.I also wonder if there is a way to get an error output after submit. 
 anid: No that is not allowed for puzzles Reksio
 anid: You may print the validators and hence it should not be allowed
 Reksio: oh, thanks. It's all right I suppose
 anid: but in the case of bot programming, it is accessible from the replay
 Reksio: thanks
 Reksio: The second question. I did some dump of Console.ReadLine and WriteLine and it looks like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cb58630d-8d37-4ebb-8a42-527ad08a5865">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cb58630d-8d37-4ebb-8a42-527ad08a5865</a>

 anid: If you paste over 5 lines, it goes to pastebin
 Reksio: Ok, sorry for spamming but I'm trying to get rid of the link thing
 Reksio: ah
 anid: NP
 Reksio: Read: 6715 microsecondsRead: 2 microseconds...Write :5 microseconds
 anid: So if you print too many error messages, it only shows the first and last
 anid: otherwise it would be too many lines
 anid: I think there is a char limit
 Reksio: Read: 6715 microsecondsRead: 0.2 microseconds...Write&#160;: 0.5 microseconds
 Reksio: Actually this is correct. I don't have ...
 Reksio: I just didn't want to post too many lines
 Reksio: I wonder if it is normal for first read to take so much time
 Reksio: I specifically talk here about the descent
 Reksio: it's the early puzzle
 Reksio: I'm trying to create my own tests but I wonder how game treats reading of input for 6.7 miliseconds
 Reksio: while the algorithm itself takes &lt; 1 microsecond for example
 Reksio: or are those slowdowns only in IDE mode but after submit there are some guarantees about execution time of ReadLine and WriteLine
 Reksio: I guess I just wonder how is execution time being calculated.
 Reksio: Is number of reads and writes always set in stone and time it takes to run them always counted as fixed value (possibly 0)&#160;?
 tutubalin: Some times input is like that:1st line: number NNext N lines: blablabla
 tutubalin: So input length may vary
 dbdr: execution time is not calculated, it is measured with a clock
 Reksio: I'm trying to say that ReadLine which is provided to us can take x100 more time to execute than our own algorithm.
 dbdr: you should start measuring after you first readline, not before
 Reksio: which seems ridiculous and hopefully is accounted for somehow by removing the impact of the input/output on final "speed" score (or some solution of sort)
 dbdr: otherwise you are measuring things that are not your code
 dbdr: readline can "take time" because it is waiting for input
 dbdr: but that's not counted as your time by the referee
 jacek: ^
 dbdr: v
 Reksio: ok, but if input time is not counted then how is solution which reads line 1000 times scored against solution which reads line only 10 times. In real life the solution which waited for input 1000 times would be much slower.
 dbdr: think of it from the point of view of the CG code
 dbdr: it sends the input, then it starts its clock and waits for your response
 dbdr: don't worry about the time readline takes, it's negligible
 dbdr: (once the input is present)
 Reksio: thank you. I will treat it as such then. This helps quite a lot!
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 jacek: for puzzle does time really matters except for timeouts?
 jacek: wether it is 20ms or 50ms
 tutubalin: Reksio the very first ReadLine may look pretty long time (from your code perpective) but referee doesn't take it into account (it;s zero for it).So start you clock after first ReadLine - that will make measures much more realistic.
 tutubalin: Also take into account that time functions are not accurate, so if timeout is 100ms, try to fit in 95ms
 Reksio: Is it just 1st read line or all read lines  and write lines? The write line takes whole 5microseconds which is longer than my whole algorithm takes for the whole game (0.5microsecond) if you substract input/output from it.
 tutubalin: just first
 Reksio: So other readlines + writelines which can take x5 amount of time of my algorithm will be counted to the score from what you say. Then why not all of them? Is there anywhere CG actually describe all of this?
 dbdr: time does not influence score
 Reksio: really? Is it just timeout based?
 dbdr: yes
 Reksio: oh, interesting but good. Is it also true for bot competitions? Some people are complaining that C++ has advantage for CG puzzles but with just timeout as score I don't see how...
 dbdr: they were speaking about multis, not puzzles
 dbdr: time matters when you want to run a search to optimize something, and run your algo as many times as possible in the allowed 50ms
 Reksio: makes sense
 Reksio: So I just need to clarify as I get mixed responses if all input/output (readline/writeline) is cut from time I spent running my puzzle or just the first one  in the whole game or the first one for each loop cycle.
 Uljahn: i think the first one in the whole game (common time limit is 1 sec) and the first one for each loop cycle
 Uljahn: ofc you can check it yourself
 tutubalin: don't measure time of the first read of every loop cycle
 tutubalin: because it takes much longer due to switch from another bot
 Reksio: thanks all for your answers
 jacek: darkhorse64 do you have some bias in your rollouts?
 darkhorse64: For Othello, no at the moment
 jacek: my early results with moves at corners trice as likely as others have much better winrate
 darkhorse64: That makes a lot of sense because taking corners is almost always a favorable move
 darkhorse64: I am trying to write a boss for Othello based on my best bot. I have nerfed the perfs, removed some features and it performs better :nerd:
 jacek: nerfed bot is better?
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: a top 1 bot is born
 darkhorse64: Yes but it still rank 6. The good news is that by removing code I probably fixed a bug in my bot. The bad news is that I won't get promoted against my own creature if struct creates a league with my boss.

 AntiSquid: spam? @_@
 AntiSquid: could do that in a private chat you know
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: did you fix your skip nodes issue?
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: isn't that Benjamin's account for when he can't log in
 AntiSquid: yes, but should he test his bot on the main chat?
 Astrobytes: No I agree, just checking you knew it wasn't some random crap
 AntiSquid: i am just thinking about this as what if everyone did the same thing
 Astrobytes: Well, still random crap&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: what if everyone posted clash invites
 Astrobytes: No I agree
 darkhorse64: Using struct expert inputs helped a lot yes
 Astrobytes: Nice one&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: expert inputs? 
 AntiSquid: extra inputs?
 Astrobytes: No, expert
 Astrobytes: Well, bthe really&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *both
 Astrobytes: 'If you output "EXPERT followed by the move"...'
 AntiSquid: aha
 Astrobytes: Just for all opponents moves and passes from the previous turn
 AntiSquid: would be really useful in many multis, less of having to reverse engineers opponent's move
 Astrobytes: Yeah it didn't occur to us before we approved, was only when darkhorse was having trouble with pass moves nodes in his MCTS we figured it would be a good idea, so struct very kindly patched it for us
 darkhorse64: Yes, fog of war for opponent moves is not handy
 Astrobytes: euler has it in Vindinium too
 darkhorse64: We should have guidelines for board games. "Opponent moves must be in the inputs". It's actually more useful than game state because you wlll have to write an engine anyway
 Astrobytes: That's a fair point actually
 AntiSquid: make it retroactively so XR has it too :p
 jacek: and oware

 CodinBotChatRelay: Pratyush#9392:??????
 CodinBotChatRelay: Pratyush#9392:I will kick you then have fun
 PhanMinhTien: hello everyone
 raulet: hello
 cult: hi
 jacek: boss validator? where
 struct: hi
 raulet: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/a-mountain-of-a-mole-hill">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/a-mountain-of-a-mole-hill</a>
 raulet: I don't know what kind of procedure i'm expected to do to pass that.
 jacek: every puzzle has test cases in validation that are not available in IDE to avoid hardcoding solutions. you can't know them
 jacek: this probably means your solution has some bugs
 raulet: they should give a clue or something on what expected to do or use, stuck at 87%, and don't know what I have to fix&#160;;&#160;;.
 Astrobytes: They usually use edge cases or test efficiency. Make some custom test cases and make sure your algo can handle them properly
 Astrobytes: e.g. large garden with lots of enclosed fence areas and lots of molehills
 raulet: I will try that, thank you.
 Astrobytes: Perhaps use "How did THAT happen?" test case as a starting point for your custom case
 Astrobytes: Also "Include and infiltrate" because of all the nested fenced areas
 tutubalin: your goal is to implemented what is specified in Puzzle StatementTest cases are just a way to test your solution (that's why they are called tests).So watching tests and trying to cover only cases described there is wrong way.
 tutubalin: In real life part programming some test cases are provided by QA, but a lot of test cases are created by developer themselves.
 Astrobytes: Hey tutubalin, it's nice to see the #ru users being more active in #world recently&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you could just go to #ru if you miss them
 Astrobytes: My Russian isn't so good&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: they are more relaxed about english speaking intruders than our french friends
 Astrobytes: :D
 darkhorse64: I use google translate. Funny results sometimes
 Astrobytes: It's not too bad for Russian mostly
 Astrobytes: I wouldn't rely on it to translate my English (or French for that matter) to Russian though
 Uljahn: do you miss MadKnight? i guess he got offended by being compared to a bot&#160;:(
 wlesavo: Astrobytes you have to be working  on uttt to join #ru though :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: The idea of Maddy being so offended that he left is a wonderful irony
 Astrobytes: lol wlesavo, seems so!
 wlesavo: this uttt fever going for a while, i got caught by it even in self isolation
 Hjax: wait, you guys scared away madknight? 
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i had the impression that cyberpunk used google translate
 Astrobytes: Yes, for some things I think he died
 eulerscheZahl: he was really understandable here on world (general back then). but his private messages were glibberish sometimes
 Astrobytes: *did, lol
 wlesavo: and died as well
 eulerscheZahl: nah
 eulerscheZahl: he just left us&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: He pops up in #ru discord with random ML related things now and then
 eulerscheZahl: but ru to en works surprisingly well
 eulerscheZahl: i never tried ru to de
 Astrobytes: afk
 wlesavo: Ich denke, Russisch zu Deutsch wird schlechter sein, da es viel weniger Benutzer gibt
 tutubalin: ja
 wlesavo: tell me if that makes any sence :smiley:
 tutubalin: Basically German is closer to slavic languages than English
 Hjax:&#160;? isnt english a germanic language 
 tutubalin: also many words came to Russian from German
 eulerscheZahl: this sentence makes perfect sense wlesavo
 eulerscheZahl: was about to ask you if you speak German :D
 wlesavo: :smiley:
 tutubalin: German is closer to English than to slavic. But it is closer to slavic than English to slavic
 eulerscheZahl: i read an interview of a google lead engineer for translations 1 or 2 years ago
 jacek: omelette du fromage
 eulerscheZahl: he's a fellow German and disappointingly said that german&lt;-&gt;english doesn't work as good as he'd like
 eulerscheZahl: machine learning approach, just feeding lots of texts and translations of books
 tutubalin: gurken - ogórek - ogurets
 tutubalin: eulerscheZahl probably they parsed it as words
 tutubalin: so they couldn't find a proper mapping for Donaudampfschifffahrtselektrizitätenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft
 jacek: a cat sat on your keyboard?
 wlesavo: tutubalin there are tools for feeding whole sentences i believe, no need to parse it
 Astrobytes: "Association for Subordinate Officials of the Head Office Management of the Danube Steamboat Electrical Services"
 Astrobytes: Google version: "danube steam shipping electricity main plant construction subordinate company"
 jacek: try deepL
 wlesavo: russian version looks like translation from english as well 
 Astrobytes: jacek, deepL just gives the same text back
 tutubalin: i think that most of emails of this company cannot pass spam filter
 Astrobytes: :D
 NASADeveloper102: How do links work in Ghost in the Cell

 Astrobytes: Just disappeared. Thankfully  
 Astrobytes: Working on his ray casting NN I suppose.
 NASADeveloper102: I don't mean that.
 NASADeveloper102: I mean how do we know the ID of the factory we're talking about.

 NASADeveloper102: Good job
 tutubalin: Python 2 is a bit outdated
 NASADeveloper102: I don't even think you can get it in codingame anymore
 -Gamma-: i think he/she meant...
 -Gamma-: I leant python "2 minutes ago"
 -Gamma-: learnt*
 NASADeveloper102: Oh I see.
 tutubalin: No
 tutubalin: I leant "python 2" a minute ago"
 NASADeveloper102: Why do you say that?
 Hjax: they definitely meant (i learned python) (two minutes ago)
 NASADeveloper102: That's what I thought.
 NASADeveloper102: Why would it be, " I learnt python 2, a minute ago"?
 wlesavo: learn python2 min()
 Hjax: learn min(python2, go)
 NASADeveloper102: Huh?
 NASADeveloper102: :joy: I wish I understood this.
 Hjax: we are just being silly
 Hjax: pay no mind :P
 NASADeveloper102: Uh okay then
 muy31: for some reason recently the console in various arenas have been giving me: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 muy31: enev though i always read all inputs
 muy31: is it some bug
 Hjax: yeah pretty sure its a bug 
 Hjax: ive been seeing it too 
 wlesavo: this is a recent feature, i think it was introduced in some forum post
 Hjax: i definitely am reading all of the inputs 
 muy31: but then it actually messes up my execution
 muy31: and i timeout
 wlesavo: are you sure this is the issue? i got that message only when i had an actual bug in my code
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3719a39a-4369-4251-9bfd-78ca860eea0c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3719a39a-4369-4251-9bfd-78ca860eea0c</a>
 muy31: when I delete the 'depth' on the return statements i get the bug
 tutubalin: i have it every so often
 muy31: as in return -50, 50, etc.
 tutubalin: when i press Play button again it disappears
 Hjax: maybe they fixed it, im not getting it anymore
 Hjax: i was getting it a lot the other day 
 muy31: no didnt fix, now i get it randomly
 jacek: lets fix it and release on friday afternoon
 struct:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I get it randomly, sometimes when I crash, sometimes if I print to stderr, othertimes just out of the blue. Never once, may I add, for the reason it is intended.
 karimdjemai: Has someone got an idea why bitwise operators in js like | might return something like 1010274303&#160;? shouldnt it be only 0s and 1s? 
 jacek: w00t?
 karimdjemai: for example (1010011101 | 1010110010) evaluates to1010274303
 Hjax: i phrased that poorly 
 jacek: no way, in python its also 1010274303!
 Hjax: it takes two numbers, regardless of a base, and returns a number, regardless of base 
 Hjax: base is just how you display the number, it doesnt change the value 
 jacek: karimdjemai try (0b1010011101 | 0b1010110010).toString(2)
 karimdjemai: ohh so youre saying it interprets the numbers as base 10 by default?
 Hjax: yes, but you are also inputting base 10 numbers 
 Hjax: 101 is one hundred and one, not 5, unless you specifically tell it you are using base 2 
 karimdjemai: thank you a lot i was very confused :D
 Hjax: 1010011101(base 10) binary or 1010110010 (base 10) is in fact 1010274303 (base 10)
 karimdjemai: makes sense!
 tutubalin: Also, remember about no very well-known feature of JS: bitwise operations always cast number to 32-bit signed integer.
 tutubalin: 1e10 | 0 == 1410065408
 tutubalin: (2e10 * 2)&#160;!= (2e10 &lt;&lt; 1)

 Astrobytes: Finished your boss yet darkhorse64?
 darkhorse64: Yes. I"m trying to understand why it works so well. I removed the solver, nerfed the engine by a factor of 2
 Hjax: boss for what? 
 Astrobytes: How 'well' does it work? 
 muy31: breakthrough
 Astrobytes: no, Othello
 darkhorse64: othello. It ranks #6
 muy31: oh
 Hjax: why are we calling it a boss? 
 Astrobytes: Because it will be
 muy31: for leagues, right
 Hjax: othello is going to have leagues? 
 Hjax: do community multis have leagues? 
 Astrobytes: Well, 2
 Astrobytes: Yes. Only Wood leagues though
 darkhorse64: If struct wants for a boss for a league, I could offer one
 Hjax: i see 
 Hjax: why only wood leagues?
 Astrobytes: But you can call them whatever you like
 struct: Sure darkhorse64
 Astrobytes: CG issue Hjax
 darkhorse64: I think a tough may foster some interest from other players. Give me a few days for testing. My eekend is going to be very busy (read not much time for CG)
 darkhorse64: *tough bot*
 Astrobytes: Yes, I'm all for decent bosses
 Astrobytes: And take your time, no rush
 Hjax: im too motivated by codinpoints to try the smaller multis 
 Astrobytes: lol, there's such a thing as fun you know. F'ing SC players :P
 Hjax: isnt fun just watching numbers increase? 
 Astrobytes: :D
 Hjax: you must have a weird definition of fun :P 
 Astrobytes: lol
 Hjax: idk, smaller multis are spooky 
 Hjax: because they are almost exclusively populated by really good people 
 Hjax: makes it hard to measure your own progress 
 struct: Site broken or only clashes?
 Astrobytes: I heard there's gonna be pylons and cannons in Othello...
 struct: It was 60+ people clash and it broke :p
 struct: 80
 Astrobytes: I'd report that struct, could be a capacity issue on CG side
 Astrobytes: btw, wtf clashes have 80+ people?! Stream?
 struct: yeah
 Astrobytes: Madness.
 jacek: maybe ru guys they moved from uttt
 Astrobytes: Hjax, I do smaller multis and I'm shit, don't worry about it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 struct: darkhorse64 don't worry too much, I would code a bot, but I also don't have much time
 jacek: maybe make my bot a boss
 struct: I'm spending time on learning sdk modules
 jacek: i would have more motivation to improve myself
 jacek: :v
 Astrobytes: They don't document the JS modules struct?
 struct: It's a bit poor
 struct: Only real documentation is UTG referee
 Astrobytes: They're updating docs soon right?
 struct: No idea
 Astrobytes: Sure I saw that in forum
 Astrobytes: I don't wanna work on SDK wiki until they do that
 darkhorse64: I would rather be worried not be able to beat my own creature
 struct: well it can use half the time
 Astrobytes: Yeah, reduce depth or calculation time, or both
 struct: easier solution
 struct:  // #pragma...
 Astrobytes: Might make it toooo dumb&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Don't want it to fail on turn 1 precalc
 struct: Ideal bot would be 30.00 points atm
 struct: boss*
 struct: wait 30.18, so no java allowed
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: But yeah, 30 seems about right given the gaps
 Hjax: why no java allowed 
 darkhorse64: No problem for that but I ant to understand how features removed improved (or not) my bot strength. For instance, doubling the rollout count helps but is approximately + 1 ELO point
 jacek: +1 with confidence [-100,101]
 struct: Hjax Im joking, I just don't like Java
 struct: And Im forced to use it on sdk&#160;:(
 Hjax:&#160;:(
 Hjax: i like java
 jacek: kree java!
 darkhorse64: I made several runs
 struct: you use mcts right?
 darkhorse64: I do
 struct: early game might be a bit weak right?
 darkhorse64: Usually things start to look wrong against the top by move 35 but it may be due to a weak start. I don't play othello myself
 jacek: neither do i
 Astrobytes: I only ever played casually myself, doing a lot of reading
 jacek: i think i would have some problem playing it with real board
 Astrobytes: Nah, you'd pick it up pretty quick I think
 darkhorse64: I am only a chess player
 Hjax: i think my goal for this weekend will be to go from bronze to legend in ghost in the cell, with 1 submit 
 Astrobytes: Stream it! Stream it! Stream it!
 Hjax: lol, why
 Hjax: my development process is not very fast, or interesting 
 darkhorse64: I did that nearly for Tron
 Astrobytes: Just a stream-worthy comment
 Hjax: its easy to get into the habit of spamming games against top people, or just spamming submits 
 Astrobytes: This was during a contest darkhorse64 no?
 Hjax: i think it will be a fun challenge to not do that 
 Hjax: plus i think ghost in the cell is a pretty easy game, so handicapping myself a bit is more fun 
 darkhorse64: No
 Astrobytes: Or after or something. I think you applied something you'd used in another contest or multi, and went gold or legend
 darkhorse64: I read the right PM
 Astrobytes: Oh I see
 darkhorse64: BFS for the in
 darkhorse64: win
 Astrobytes: You don't even have to correct your typos anymore, I'm quite used to filling them in myself :P
 Astrobytes: Need to get your ankles working properly to fix them.
 darkhorse64: my w key is not in great shape. Technically, it is not a typo but a hardware malfunction
 Hjax: the hard part is going to be knowing when my bot is strong enough enough 
 Hjax: uh, scratch one enough 
 Astrobytes: OK, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt darkhorse64 
 darkhorse64: It's so kind of you
 Astrobytes: I'm a generous type :D
 Astrobytes: Hjax, you can use replays from top bots etc etc
 Hjax: sure, but i cant play against them 
 Hjax: i read agades pm
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure you can CG bench against them if you fiddle around a bit
 Hjax: no no no, thats cheating 
 Astrobytes: Nope, technically it is not.
 Hjax: hmmmmm
 Astrobytes: But I get your point&#160;;)
 Ratchef: Is there a way to invite my friends to a private battle?
 Hjax: i really like agades solution to the question "can i get punished by increasing here"
 DestroyTasmania: yeah you can create privat lobby and send them link or just invite on right
 DestroyTasmania: @Ratchef
 Hjax: just play against a clone of yourself that doesnt increase, and see if you get rekt 
 Astrobytes: I don't remember if I ever read the PMs for that game tbh
 Hjax: i played a lot of galcon back in the day 
 Hjax: on my ipod touch 
 Hjax: fun game 
 Astrobytes: And yeah, self-play also a solution. Just don't overfit. brutaltester is good for that
 Astrobytes: Yeah galcon was great
 struct: I tried to get legend in 1 submitg
 struct: did not end well
 Hjax: i also played the 2010 planet wars ai challenge
 Astrobytes: something something something account deletion
 Hjax: back when i was brand new to programming 
 eulerscheZahl: public github repos are a great source for bronze to legend in 1 submit
 struct: I think the closest I got was uttt
 struct: Where i got like top 3 gold
 struct: from bronze to legend in 1 submit
 Hjax: lol, as test opponents, or as copy/paste steal the bot euler?
 struct: c&amp;p

 struct: If there is a bot 
 struct: its in this profile
 eulerscheZahl: i was expecting this user when i clicked the link
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: I think I sitll have the link of his old account
 struct: give me a sec
 darkhorse64: When you see a top 20 guy ask what is a BFS, you figure out why C/P is a bad thing
 Astrobytes: To paraphrase jacek "eeyup"
 Hjax: lol, he stole all of his submissions?
 dbdr: 16th?
 dbdr: copy paster I guess
 darkhorse64: This is the guy I was thinking of
 Astrobytes: yeah
 darkhorse64: Look at his CP profile, especially the time scale
 Hjax: im surprised theres such strong bots publicly available 
 dbdr: 4996CP in clash
 darkhorse64: guru in to weeks
 eulerscheZahl: struct claiming that it's anirudh? i don't think so
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: darkhorse64 sorry to bother you but what is that BFS you were talking about?
 darkhorse64: :smile:
 dbdr: Big Fing Secret
 dbdr: nobody really knows
 eulerscheZahl: Fing? Chinese?
 Hjax: theres really that many strong open source bots? im kind of surprised lol
 dbdr: effing
 Astrobytes: Bird First Search
 JBM: isn't effing spelled with an E?
 dbdr: yes but that ruins the accronym
 Astrobytes: f'ing would be more correct
 darkhorse64: Hjax: yes

 Astrobytes: Who knows JBM, we can try
 JBM: nobody Really knows JBM
 reCurse: That's really sad
 JBM: innit
 reCurse: Was talking about the copy paster
 JBM: point stands
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: no struct. there should be a tagline "almost alll languages". with 3 L
 JBM: oh new meme
 Astrobytes: JBM: "Who knows, JBM. We can try"
 JBM: what did i miss?
 eulerscheZahl: old actually, account deleted years ago
 JBM: ouch
 eulerscheZahl: he claimed to be able to code in all languages
 eulerscheZahl: as the bots he copied were in different languages :D
 Hjax: amazing 
 Astrobytes: ani d profile looks about right then "I am a 12th grade student at Indus Bangalore, I have learnt several languages: python, C++, C, C# and Java. Dabble in JS, ruby. Now learning D"
 struct: So this one ueler?

 Astrobytes: It's not True CG unless it's 0nd
 struct: No score on multi
 struct: Not even language shows
 eulerscheZahl: you found him struct!
 struct: yes he is bottom of hypersonic legend leaderboard
 struct: last player
 struct: Doesnt even show language
 eulerscheZahl: iirc thibaud did some cleanup
 jacek: a purge
 eulerscheZahl: he got DQed in a contest (stole python bot, added bash wrapper and claimed it's pure bash)
 eulerscheZahl: then rage-deleted the profile after he got lots of hate on the chat
 struct: also he used bot on CoC
 jacek: who rage deletes their account?
 Astrobytes: :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: absolutely barbaric
 Astrobytes: :D
 freeman42x: streaming clash of code: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://twitch.tv/freeman42x">http://twitch.tv/freeman42x</a>
 Hjax: why did struct delete his again? because he was upset with his UTG bot?
 struct: I said legend in 1 submit or delete
 Hjax: ah
 Astrobytes: Waited until last day
 Hjax: UTG is a pretty hard game to get legend in 1 submit with 
 jacek: just like you, 1 submit from bronze to gold
 Astrobytes: , night even right struct?
 Hjax: because its so metagame dependent 
 struct: I cant remember well
 Hjax: planting fake bombs and guessing your opponents 
 struct: But maybe
 Hjax: hard to test properly with just selfplay 
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure you waited til the night
 Astrobytes: Don't do that again eh
 struct: We need more anonymous contributions

 Daher: for java, c, c++ and c# coders
 Astrobytes: Not very private if you er, post it in world chat, is it?
 EliTheCoder: he just doesn't want to get bots in his game
 EliTheCoder: and he can control what languages he wants
 Astrobytes: The bots will be there if not enough players anyway. And yes, I'm aware of that. The feature is supposed to be for sharing with friends you want to clash with.
 muy31: what's the deal with short time limits anyway? does making it too long cause issues with servers and whatnot or what?
 Astrobytes: Yes. Imagine a leaderboard of 2000 bots all using 1 second of calculation time, playing matches against each other
 Astrobytes: For the CG configuration this would be a Very Bad Thing.
 muy31: i see
 muy31: that is why we cannot do chess on CG 
 Astrobytes: We could have a chess game on here for sure, it would have to depend a helluva lot on book moves though&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Fischer-Random/Chess960 might be doable though
 Astrobytes: And it still might be a nice addition just to practice on
 muy31: i dont see it happening and any  of the ais submitted to the leaderboard actually being good
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah? I'd bet otherwise
 muy31: unless like someone hard codes a move for each state
 Astrobytes: like I said "it would have to depend a helluva lot on book moves though"
 Astrobytes: Which is about 80% of chess anyway right
 muy31: in that case, one would preprogram a chess bot locally and the CG bot would just a 'scribe'
 Astrobytes: Not quite, bit more to it than that
 CykaBo: share code on hjava pls
 Astrobytes: Neumann, I never noticed your 5th place in CSB, nice 
 Neumann: Thks, SR gave me a slight eval improvment :D
 Astrobytes: "slight" :D
 CykaBo: share codes pls
 Astrobytes: CykaBo 1234abcd!"£$ - now decipher the code
 CykaBo: at the end I meant 4Head
 Neumann: What do you expect us to understand with "share code"
 CykaBo: show code or whatever the option's name is
 Astrobytes: Qml0ZSBteSBzaGlueSBtZXRhbCBhc3Mh
 JBM: that password is going to need replacing
 JBM: omg a Neumann
 Neumann:&#160;?
 JBM: hadn't seen you in a long time
 JBM: always a delight tho, until proven otherwise
 Astrobytes: So as not to pollute #fr JBM, I suggest your trolls should have been Korrigans
 JBM: lal
 JBM: you're so welcome to pollute #fr
 Astrobytes: I try not to, sometimes I "cross over"
 JBM: we welcome that
 JBM: i personally welcome it more when it's expressed in #fr
 JBM: as bad as it comes (hi MK)
 Astrobytes: lol
 JBM: the effort is what makes it worth it
 Astrobytes: on that note, MK left it seems
 Astrobytes: Anyway I'm out for tonight

 NASADeveloper102: -HUh
 NASADeveloper102: What?
 NASADeveloper102: I don't know whether or not to take this seriously, but I assume if you were dying in real life you would call the police and probably not come here, the probability that you would come here instead of any other place is very low.
 NASADeveloper102: I don't know why I just explained my train of thought to a person who was saying, " Help, I need a notch apple "
 JBM: please stand by
 JBM: police will be with you shortly
 NASADeveloper102: I wish I knew how to respond to that.
 JBM: "do you have a warrant?"
 JBM: "is habeas corpus even a thing anymore in my country?"
 NASADeveloper102: Uh....

 NASADeveloper102:&#160;%=&#160;?
 NASADeveloper102: I don't know
 LelouchVC2: Python 3.8 introduces a feature that lets the code fondle your balls
 scareware047: can i downgrade
 scareware047: my league
 scareware047: and start over in another language
 tomatoes: no, but you can start with another language in your current league
 scareware047: ye but current league is hard xD

 Reksio: Hi All. Is code golf counting a source code length after or before the compilation&#160;?
 Reksio: I also wonder how time it takes to finish the puzzle is taken into account if at all.
 Reksio: Anyone?
 SPDene: time taken to finish is only relevant is it takes (i think) &gt; 15s. then it will time out/fail
 SPDene: if*
 struct: code length is show on ide
 struct: its before compilation
 struct: all chars count, spaces, tabs, comments
 Reksio: haha&#160;:) this is great
 Reksio: and you say 15s 8-)
 Ratchef: Hello I have a question about Java 
 struct: Also compilation time doesnt matter
 Reksio: +1
 struct: Since the time will get is the time you press on submit
 Ratchef: Can I add a variable to itself like this? int value = value +1; 
 Reksio: yes
 struct: Ratchef yes, but you can declare it again
 struct: like you just did
 struct: you did int value = value + 1;
 Ratchef: It often tells me that the value isn't initialized 
 struct: yeah, if you never assigned a value to it
 struct: it might happen
 Ratchef: So I should do int value = 0; value = value + whatever; 
 struct: or value += whatever;
 Ratchef: okay I'll try next time thanks
 Ratchef: Is there a way for the code to know if a character is uppercase or lowercase?
 struct: yeah
 Ratchef: Is that a java function?

 MostComplicatedUsername: ML?
 MostComplicatedUsername: COnfused
 Tiramon: Antisquid, current version in arena trained for around 3k games something around 50mins
 Tiramon: i'm just uploading a new
 Tiramon: looks like the new version learned the 'In fact, one must always make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing.' rule
 Tiramon: new version trained another 4h
 Tiramon: that means 15k games
 Tiramon: damn webquinty always generates a state where my bit still picks an invalid actionand the boss still wins by score

 MostComplicatedUsername: lol im the best
 ArianPunk: Hi, anyone would want to answer my question regarding the ANEO puzzle?
 WINWINWIN: :D MostComplicatedUsername
 WINWINWIN: What is the doubt ArianPunk?
 WINWINWIN: Personally, I bruteforced the puzzle
 ArianPunk: I think I'm ok now. The validity of puzzle does depend on the speeds and sitances
 ArianPunk: distances*
 WINWINWIN: Yes
 ArianPunk: you mean you tried all the speeds one by one?
 WINWINWIN: Yes, I tried all starting from smallest and printed when I found a valid one
 ArianPunk: It took a few if conditions?
 WINWINWIN: Yeah
 ArianPunk: same as me, but im doin it from max to the correct speed.
 WINWINWIN: That would be a bit slower right?
 ArianPunk: reverse
 ArianPunk: faster
 ArianPunk: I think both
 ArianPunk: depends on the asnwer
 ArianPunk: we re looking for the max speed. so it makes more sense to start from the max speed we are allowed.
 WINWINWIN: Yes
 pb4: Tiramon&#160;: what game&#160;?
 struct: he is doing oware
 ArianPunk: yup, ANOA done. I do better on medium puzzles than on easy ones.
 AntiSquid: oh my bad, i thought his NN model was for vindinium where he is like #15 :D
 AntiSquid: maybe i should have went to sleep earlier, but basically last night look at vindinium leaderboard and thought, damn Tiramon progressed fast
 AntiSquid: looked *
 Tiramon: pb4 oware aba.. something
 Tiramon: guess vindinium is a bit more complicated than oware&#160;;)
 ShlOk: Illuminati!!!!!
 Tiramon: and Antisquid oware has 12 states  in range of 0 - theoreticall 48 and 6 actions vindinium has 5 actions, but the board alone constists of 576 states in range of 0-7 + states for life, gold, 
 Astrobytes: Try some of the other board/grid games Tiramon, simpler stuff t han Vindinium&#160;;)
 Tiramon: first i want to get to the next league in oware with my dqn&#160;;)
 pb4: Tiramon&#160;: care to share more about what you're doing&#160;?
 Astrobytes: of, priorities and all that&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *ofc
 pb4: dqn + self play is difficult to combine
 jacek: next league in oware?
 jacek: im still in wood :C
 struct: But there is wood 1 and 2
 jacek: so he didnt even made into wood1? noob
 Astrobytes: :P
 dsy: f²
 Mirartes: ASCII ART4 TEST M@NH@TT@NWTF where @?
 Mirartes: its dont A and dont O
 Uljahn: non A-Z -&gt; "?"
 Mirartes: thx)
 Mirartes: я пропустил)
 daffie: is bronze league available for the weekly puzzle yet?
 wlesavo: daffie there will be no bronze
 jacek: thats community game
 jacek: they dont have bronze+ leages
 daffie: so there is only wood league?
 Astrobytes: yep
 daffie: oh okay
 Astrobytes: Just think of placement as equivalent to leagues
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: but don't too highly of your placement ^
 struct: One day Yinsh will be available
 Astrobytes: like someone we know
 AntiSquid: top 300 doesn't equal gold in a community puzzle of 315 
 struct: and I can rest
 struct: Dont know what you mean
 jacek: no rest. make more games
 AntiSquid: actually struct could make and suggest a community contest, and if CG rejects it then he could just make it a community multi since he does it anyway
 struct: I dont have original ideas for contests 
 struct: Both my multies are ports
 struct: of games that already exist
 Astrobytes: So you just need ideas then
 struct: and I need to like it
 struct: the idea
 AntiSquid: the games you do are very obscure
 AntiSquid: and you can just change a few rules
 AntiSquid: captain sonar is played as 8 players, but was modified
 Astrobytes: well yeah
 struct: I was gonna port Arimaa next
 struct: but im not sure if I will
 struct: chat down?
 Astrobytes: back now it seems...
 Tiramon: pb4 all i did was let my DQN with fixed Q targets and ER/PER play against old weights of himself with the official referee
 Tiramon: and because my agent didn't learn this 'moves are invalid if opponent can't move' i seeded a few states in the PER with a high deltaQ in my last training session
 Tiramon: i then let him play around 5k games with different opponents of his weight
 Tiramon: last run was another 15k games
 Tiramon: worked quite good, but he still has alot to learn .. the boss is a real "§$"%"
 AntiSquid: i don't remember the boss being that hard, i mean i was just checking for the basic == 2 or == 3
 cegprakash: Hi guys tomorrow I'll be streaming paper soccer or search race  let me know which one you prefer. Fantastic bits fans I'll stream it next week or the week after. The idea is to do easier games first
 ZarthaxX: i dont think those are easy to start
 Astrobytes: Sure they are Zarthalderaan
 AntiSquid: papper soccer looks annoying to do, didn't even read statement, but ceg didn't either i guess
 cegprakash: as long as it has "soccer" in it I'm interested
 cegprakash: and I want to try GAimax
 Astrobytes: I will only watch if you also have a Prune Array.
 cegprakash: no Prune array
 cegprakash: it's too much to ask
 Astrobytes: 1 less viewer...
 cegprakash: yeah 1 less viewer out off the 5 viewers I get
 Astrobytes: Yeah but people rewatch streams later
 cegprakash: codingarden seems to be streaming now
 cegprakash: I'm going in
 Astrobytes: Anyway it's about quality of viewers, not quantity...
 Illedan: struct, slow? :D
 struct: rusty javascript
 Illedan: haha
 cegprakash: wow thx Astrobytes
 struct: Yinsh was approved
 struct: :fireworks:
 Illedan: :clap:
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 WINWINWIN: Nice struct!!
 ZarthaxX: pog
 Astrobytes: They pushed it 3 hours early struct!
 WINWINWIN: How do you start playing it?
 thepianist59: I think that I have a little problem in my clash of code ... I return the expected value each time but the console tell me that no output is expected
 struct: I quit this clash, Ill go next one
 struct: :p
 Astrobytes: Has AntiSquid submitted in D yet?
 Illedan: This one was crazy hard
 ZarthaxX: Astropytopus howdy
 thepianist59: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/VqVijkp.png">https://i.imgur.com/VqVijkp.png</a>That .. weird
 struct: not weird
 Astrobytes: You missed my Zarthalderaan earlier AnthraxX
 struct: it ask for 97
 struct: not 97.0
 struct: you need to remove leading 0
 thepianist59: but it tell me&#160;: expected&#160;: nothing
 struct: yeah it expected nothing
 thepianist59: not expected 97
 struct: you stil printed .0
 struct: Yeah can be a bit tricky
 thepianist59: but normally it tell "expected: 97"
 thepianist59: not expected nothing
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes i saw it
 ZarthaxX: now you are using my second part of the name
 WINWINWIN: I will savour this a lot :D
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/QiaGxVK">https://imgur.com/QiaGxVK</a>
 Astrobytes: Ah OK OctoZarth. Yes, the whole name is available for use
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 ZarthaxX: sheez
 Astrobytes: Zarthabytes
 ZarthaxX: the fusion is real :O
 Astrobytes: Unclear Fusion achieved :P
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 struct: I win WINWINWIN
 struct: my true ai is too powerfull
 WINWINWIN: :angry: WHY?
 WINWINWIN: 11 points above me??
 ZarthaxX: lol
 WINWINWIN: :D
 ZarthaxX: gg
 struct: yeah i coded it in 30 sec
 WINWINWIN:&#160;????
 WINWINWIN: I just submitted random.choice(validActions)
 struct: I added 3 lines to default code
 ZarthaxX: this game is super complex right
 struct: 4*
 struct: A bit complex ZarthaxX
 struct: lots of moves 
 Astrobytes: Not super-complex, but a little more than average
 ZarthaxX: big branching as time progresses?
 struct: Sometimes there are 200+' moves
 ZarthaxX: :I
 WINWINWIN: I havent read the rules yet&#160;:) thats the problem with valid actions given
 ZarthaxX: that's an interesting challenge for the community
 struct: But those 200+ will probably have game ending
 struct: Like someitmes you will have moves where you can remove 2 rings at once
 struct: might even remove 3
 struct: which is insta ending
 WINWINWIN: Struct we played 71 matches and I won 3 of them&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: friendly reminder: Kotlin Heroes starts soon
 struct: vovels Illedan
 struct: :D
 Illedan: LOL
 WINWINWIN: codeforces eulerscheZahl?
 struct: submit is 200 matches
 struct: nice
 Illedan: I have to go in 30 min eulerscheZahl&#160;:(
 mimobiscocho: hi
 eulerscheZahl: yes codeforces
 eulerscheZahl: solve 1 task and you have chances for 1 of 50 random tshirts
 eulerscheZahl: or reach top50
 WINWINWIN: Kotlin similar to Java? idk Kotlin&#160;:(
 b0ot: Could anyone explain why this code wouldn' t work: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/115ec487-4105-4404-bf68-f084d3f46f36">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/115ec487-4105-4404-bf68-f084d3f46f36</a>
 eulerscheZahl: kotlin looks different to Java
 ZarthaxX: b0ot you gotta give a context
 b0ot: check if at least one capital letter, one lower case letter. one digit, and 8 characters or longer
 RoboStac: also I'm assuming legnth isn't a valid function
 b0ot: I believe it is
 b0ot: I console.log an example and a,b,c,S.length were all true
 RoboStac: shouldn't it be length?
 b0ot: somehow the &amp;&amp; of them all was false
 b0ot: DAH
 b0ot: dangit
 b0ot: spelling
 b0ot: lol
 RoboStac:&#160;:)
 b0ot: I spelled it correctly in the debug
 b0ot: not in the actual call
 b0ot: sob
 struct: eulerscheZahl I must do the challenge in kotlin?
 WINWINWIN: "Kotlin Heroes"
 eulerscheZahl: of course struct
 eulerscheZahl: last time it was 9 tasks
 eulerscheZahl: a few easy one, some medium, some hard
 eulerscheZahl: 2.5h
 WINWINWIN: How many tasks do we need to solve to get a decent rank?
 eulerscheZahl: ICPC format: your penalty times will be added
 eulerscheZahl: last time i solved 6 out of nine. was close but i got top50 with it
 cegprakash: codingarden clash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1237089a1675656b5daf469481222c11d453f95">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1237089a1675656b5daf469481222c11d453f95</a>
 Astrobytes: Don't post clash links in chat please cegprakash&#160;;)
 WINWINWIN: :D
 WINWINWIN: what is codingarden cegprakash?
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/codinggarden">https://www.twitch.tv/codinggarden</a>
 Astrobytes: A streamer WINWINWIN
 eulerscheZahl: i just shared a tshirt contest with random winners ceg. and you come with clashes
 Illedan: I can invite you instead Astrobytes?
 eulerscheZahl: i think I won
 Astrobytes: Hell no Illedan :P
 struct: please shortest
 cegprakash: what t shirt
 Illedan: fastest
 cegprakash: I loves T shirt
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/78047">https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/78047</a>
 eulerscheZahl: top 50 will win a Kotlin Heroes t-shirt and an exclusive Kotlin sticker, competitors solving at least one problem will enter into a draw for one of 50 Kotlin Heroes t-shirts.
 WINWINWIN: shortest
 jacek: will they win kotlin ketchup as well?
 Astrobytes: And will it be called Kotchup? Or Ketchlin?
 jacek: and woah, paper soccer? move generation is quite the beast
 AntiSquid: ceg posting clash links
 AntiSquid: i really starting thinking you're some kind of subliminal troll
 WINWINWIN: euler finished the first one on Kotlin Heroes?
 AntiSquid: or rather subtle troll&#160;?
 Astrobytes: He's very far from subtle lol
 AntiSquid: obscure? hard to tell if he's trolling or serious
 AntiSquid: gaymax algo will be forever remembered by CG chat
 Astrobytes: Along with the Prune Array
 AntiSquid: Prune A* sort ment
 Astrobytes: lol
 ArianPunk: anyone done winamax?
 AntiSquid: yes
 ArianPunk: some tests can be solved in more than one way, cant they?
 ArianPunk: E.g. test 3.
 AntiSquid: ah yes, but there's a specific way the problem wants you to solve
 ArianPunk: The don't cross
 AntiSquid: i think i did it recursively and it worked not sure anymore what their logic was
 ArianPunk: its says itself , that it's recursive.
 AntiSquid: it got annoying when trying to reverse engineer their thinking
 ArianPunk: Anyway, Im almost sure it cant be done in different ways legally.
 ArianPunk: According to its own rules.
 AntiSquid: yes it can
 AntiSquid: i just agreed with you&#160;:/
 shaggy1:&#160;:)
 ArianPunk: You said there's a specific way.
 AntiSquid: there's a specific way you need to solve it to get the 100%
 ArianPunk: hm
 AntiSquid: because the validators expect only 1 specific answer
 ArianPunk: Supposedly won't put time on it when I figured the answer ain't single.
 AntiSquid: i liked the problem at first, but then got annoyed when i found out my solution wasn't accepted because it's slightly different although correct
 ArianPunk: Probably *
 ArianPunk: You beat it on its rules, and itndidnt give you the green tick?
 AntiSquid: it did
 VikasVishwakarma: hey
 ArianPunk: But they didn't accept it? weird. whats that mean
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: it means that my initial solution was giving one type of correct answer and the other their desired correct answer
 AntiSquid: which is what we have been discussing all along
 AntiSquid: wtf ...
 AntiSquid: AD&#160;?
 cegprakash: codingarden closed the stream after seeing my solution <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1237089a1675656b5daf469481222c11d453f95">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1237089a1675656b5daf469481222c11d453f95</a>
 cegprakash: RIP codingarden
 AntiSquid: no clash links please cegprakash
 cegprakash: I didn't invite you
 cegprakash: do u want me to invite you?
 AntiSquid: see what i mean? hard to tell ...
 cegprakash: clash is also part of this website.. it's allowed in world chat. As long as I don't invite u it shouldn't trouble you
 struct: ok, put more spam in it
 struct: Maybe ill start spamming invites to you
 AntiSquid: ok maybe it's me . ceg bragging about his clash skills and this is the right chat to brag i guess .
 WINWINWIN: Im 4/4 in yinsh&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: top 5&#160;!! :o
 WINWINWIN: :D
 struct: We have been beaten
 struct: 100% win rate
 struct: Now we just need to wait for tric trac to destroy us even more
 AntiSquid: using the power of D to climb
 WINWINWIN: Nicely done TricTrac
 trictrac: thanks
 struct: you are using MCTS?
 WINWINWIN: He has only 1 loss, against you antisquid
 trictrac: yes for the first time (all others bots are alpha-beta)
 darkhorse64: random rollouts&#160;?
 trictrac: no eval
 trictrac: it 's a patched MCTS
 Astrobytes: Early termination?
 darkhorse64: "patched": smart moves inside the rollouts&#160;?
 Astrobytes: (good job btw)
 darkhorse64: What impress me the most is that tric trac comes so fast with a good bot
 trictrac: I worked on yinsh since the first version
 Astrobytes: Yeah. He's got the experience and the knowledge deeply embedded there darkhorse64&#160;;)
 struct: Lets see how strong bots will become
 struct: From some replays I saw from actual players
 struct: They dont seem to place rings at the middle
 Astrobytes: Yeah, defo gonna have to study the game a bit before I write a bot for it. Hope you get many players struct
 Astrobytes: Made a great job of it
 struct: Im thinking on porting arimaa, but i have mixed feelings on it
 struct: Thanks astro
 Astrobytes: Why the mixed feelings?
 struct: Might be a bit too hard
 struct: 4 moves per turn per player
 struct: With so many moves possible
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah. Well, it was designed to be difficult for computers right
 struct: yeah
 struct: And 15 sec per player isnt really much
 struct: I wish there was time bank
 Astrobytes: What about a variant, since it's CG limitations
 struct: So player could choose how much time he uses
 Astrobytes: Yeah, time banking would be useful for sure
 struct: CG keeps track of time, they could just add it to the SDK&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Put in a feature request. . .
 struct: Also if you guys feel that 100 ms is too short for YInsh, feel free to say so
 struct: I left at 100, but I can increase it up to 200 maybe
 struct: even 300
 Astrobytes: Seems doable in 100, pruning moves and whatnot
 Astrobytes: You know, with my Prune Array
 struct: What did I miss?
 struct: I cant recall
 Astrobytes: ceg's Prune Array, you remember
 Astrobytes: He had an array of numbers he was using to prune moves, and thought it was a/b pruning
 struct: Oh right, my memory
 struct: cant forget this usefull method
 Astrobytes: :D
 Hammodeh: Hello World
 Uljahn: then GAimax was invented, the common algo for games that GAimax solves
 jacek: why would you laugh. he just got wrong idea. i bet everyone had some wrong ideas about how a/b or mcts works ~~
 Astrobytes: It's not that. It's the overconfidence thing jacek, it's like a ceg meme
 jacek: is he popular
 Astrobytes: popularly annoying yes :PBut he's actually a nice guy, I like him
 Snef: Hello
 Snef: how's your SR Astrobytes&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Hey Snef, not quite ready unfortunately, bad week (family). But should hopefully be up and running with that and some BR improvements too pretty soon
 Astrobytes: ooosh, when did Neumann get ahead of reCurse?
 Snef: yesterday evening or this night i think
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure this evening, I think I looked earlier today and he was 2nd
 reCurse: Pretty sure I already spent too much CPU time on this hardcoding garbage
 Astrobytes: lol, don't hold back there reCurse
 jacek: maybe you should go back to u,,,
 reCurse: Even uttt would be a better time investment
 reCurse: Marginally better though, much like refining hardcoded garbage
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 reCurse: The only plus is it's CPU doing most of the work
 reCurse: The minus is it gets my office hot during summer
 reCurse: So...
 Astrobytes: Not really a choice is it&#160;:)
 reCurse: Choice?
 Astrobytes: Whether to run the CPU hot or not in summer
 eulerscheZahl: homeoffice will be a pain in the summer&#160;:(
 Snef: Yeah..
 eulerscheZahl: my room is under the roof. usually i just darken the room before i go to work. but this time :scream:
 Snef: buy/build an air conditioner :p
 Astrobytes: It already is for me. It's been pretty hot and had the windows wide open, there's a huge dog lives in the house opposite and he barks constantly, sets off all the other dogs in the neighbourhood
 Astrobytes: So I bake to death or get distracted to death by dogs
 eulerscheZahl: i have neighbors with lawn mowers for that, no dog needed
 Tiramon: noise is no problem i got wonderful headphones&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, got that too. Don't mind so much, the dogs are way worse
 Astrobytes: Yeah but it's not always practical to have the headphones on all the time Tiramon
 eulerscheZahl: freedom for my ears, headphones make them sweaty
 struct: You should use CPU on yinsh next
 Tiramon: i bough some beyerdynamics not long ago ... never had sweaty ears with them
 Astrobytes: The soft velvety ones?
 Astrobytes: Well, cushioned
 eulerscheZahl: as i'm alone in my "office" now, i just put everything on speaker
 Astrobytes: Like the DT 770's Tiramon?
 Tiramon: Astrobytes MMX300
 Astrobytes: Ah gaming ones, sorry, I only know their studio range
 Astrobytes: If they're anywhere close to the DT 770s in terms of comfort then it's gotta be good
 Astrobytes: my AKGs are comfy but I need to listen out for phonecalls, doorbells etc
 Tiramon: my wife does that for me when i have them on&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Ah so that's what they're for. I'd better get one ASAP :P
 reCurse: With such a proposal should be a done deal
 Astrobytes: Hah. My last 2 exes would have murdered me if such things were expected of them.
 Tiramon: she is sitting closer to the door anyway ...
 Tiramon: and the last 5 years i was closer and had to walk
 eulerscheZahl: i just figured out why I failed problem F at kotlin heroes :cry:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.diffchecker.com/Wxlkh93T">https://www.diffchecker.com/Wxlkh93T</a>
 Astrobytes: strategic relocation then Tiramon&#160;;)
 reCurse: diffchecker
 reCurse: That's new to me
 reCurse: Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: only for sharing. I use meld offline
 Tiramon: was her idea
 Astrobytes: Even better
 reCurse: Yeah I figured for the sharing part
 Astrobytes: Oh dear eulerscheZahl, that's rough
 reCurse: I really like vs code's diff
 reCurse: Also my condolences on the input parsing
 eulerscheZahl: me too. but i don't have VS on my private machine. only in office
 reCurse: Reminds me when I messed up reading the second enemy pod in CSB and didn't notice for months
 reCurse: vs code is free and light though
 eulerscheZahl: i remember you said something like that for CSB
 eulerscheZahl: i have VS code but almost never use it
 reCurse: Strange
 eulerscheZahl: i like my MonoDevelop
 eulerscheZahl: even if it has some quirks
 Astrobytes: lol, I bet it was simultaneously relieving and hugely irritating to discover that CSB input bug
 eulerscheZahl: rightclick on file =&gt; open file locationand it crashed
 reCurse: Isn't that abandoned
 eulerscheZahl: no?
 reCurse: Astrobytes: that day I jumped from top 20 to top 3
 reCurse: Wasn't sure whether to be mad or happy
 Astrobytes: hahaha, I can imagine
 reCurse: Maybe I'm confusing with SharpDevelop
 reCurse: Damn those names
 eulerscheZahl: one of those started as a fork of the other
 eulerscheZahl: don't ask me which was first
 Astrobytes: Jeez
 reCurse: Which was first?
 Astrobytes: You totally asked for t hat
 reCurse: Sorry I thought it was a "don't invite me to clash" thing
 eulerscheZahl: last stable release: 7.6.9.22 / September 21, 2018; 20 months ago
 reCurse: Which one
 eulerscheZahl: hm, maybe it *is* abandoned...
 eulerscheZahl: MonoDevelop
 Astrobytes: For...&#160;?
 reCurse: Hah
 Astrobytes: lel
 reCurse: Guess I'm not that senile yet
 struct: rip
 eulerscheZahl: and SharpDevelop: 5.1.0 / 14 April 2016; 4 years ago
 reCurse: I'm guessing it's also just a matter of time for Mono itself to be dead
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, now that .net core is open source and runs on linux as well...
 eulerscheZahl: that was the sole reason for Mono
 Astrobytes: Which is a good thing really so... no real loss
 reCurse: I like unity. The word not the engnie.
 eulerscheZahl: the Ubuntu UI?
 reCurse: sigh
 reCurse: Except for web I've mostly given up on C#
 Astrobytes: lol
 reCurse: I made peace with C++
 Astrobytes: Even for non-imgui GUI stuff?
 351062: Aren't you on the "tools" team&#160;? I though they were mostly developed in C#
 reCurse: Yeah I'd use Qt over WPF *ANY* fucking day
 reCurse: WPF can burn and die
 reCurse: And then burn again
 reCurse: And fly the ashes to another galaxy
 reCurse: I'd sponsor that
 reCurse: Neumann: That was another lifetime
 reCurse: Things change
 Neumann: About C# or the tools team&#160;?
 Astrobytes: hahaha, your feelings on the matter are very clear
 reCurse: Both
 Neumann: Ok, what are you working on atm&#160;? If that's not secret
 reCurse: I'm not disclosing that stuff in public anymore
 reCurse: We can DM though
 Astrobytes: Not disclosing you current role?
 Astrobytes: Or project?
 reCurse: Work in general
 Astrobytes: Fair. One is entitled to at the very least a private work life.
 AntiSquid: hey struct add some tags to your multi
 struct: true ai?
 AntiSquid: :thumbsup:
 AntiSquid: True AI
 Astrobytes: GAimax, Chokudai, True AI, Prune Array
 struct: I guess I'll add minimax and mcts
 struct: Dont know if anything else works
 AntiSquid: wasn't there something like policy matrix mentioned by ceg? Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: i def remember something matrix related
 Astrobytes: Payoff matrix, for simultaneous 2-player minimax, yeah
 Astrobytes: Insisted he had one, couldn't explain how he chose a move from it, then couldn't figure out if it was GA or minimax, then started asking how to understand Nash equilibria
 Astrobytes: Along those lines
 Astrobytes: Was a fun afternoon
 AntiSquid: add Payoff matrix struct
 Astrobytes: And all that time it was just a MC
 AntiSquid: payoff matrix sounds more like scoring the possible moves ... nothing special
 Astrobytes: Yeah it helps with minimaxing simultaneous 2 player games, I've never used it just read about it
 Astrobytes: "Sequential games in normal form" that's the term I was looking for. Like XR
 Astrobytes: Sure someone mentioned it in a PM for that
 Astrobytes: Might help you out AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: Don't ask me for advice though, I' not exactly an expert in game theory
 AntiSquid: joli 
 AntiSquid: i am struggling with motivation to write anything Astrobytes, not with solving something
 Astrobytes: Then it's time to move away from it and come back to it later at some point
 AntiSquid: maybe
 Astrobytes: When you're getting nothing from it, it's a no-brainer to move on elsewhere
 Astrobytes: Work on some ML stuff
 MostComplicatedUsername: ohhhh I realized why my bandas code isn't working
 MostComplicatedUsername: I'm not taking into account the floor falling
 jacek: but you take into account roof falling
 Astrobytes: btw MostComplicatedUsername, don't get too excited about beating me. I saw your replay from earlier.Here's my AI:int m = r.getRandomInt(4);
 struct: ups I dont output who won or lost 
 struct: or do I'
 struct: nope
 struct: I need to fix it
 struct: :D
 jacek: i still need to improve my bitboard for bandas
 struct: you misspell Yinsh
 Bobliu: are you supposed to get CP for optimization challenges?
 struct: yeah
 Astrobytes: It'll update later on
 Neumann: Once per day, during the night (CET)
 Astrobytes: XP is instantaneous, CP is as Neumann says
 Astrobytes: (sorry for ping)
 Bobliu: ohhh ok thanks
 Bobliu: it updates later on 
 Astrobytes: jacek, you did something different in Oware?
 struct: ok I think its finished
 struct: messages also added
 struct: I guess ill just add the line how to in statement
 Astrobytes: Yinsh ish finshished?
 Astrobytes: :trumpet: :tada: :rosette: :rocket: 
 struct: I think so
 struct: Only touching it if someone finds bugs
 Astrobytes: I didn't find any so far, I did a whole bunch of stupid inputs etc and seemed ok, moves seemed to be working fine. I mean I looked already in the contribution but double checked. Will let you know if there's anything untoward going on.
 Astrobytes: *checked already
 WINWINWIN: Wide margin between #2 and #3 in yinsh
 WINWINWIN: 12 points
 struct: yes, top 2 might have an ai
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Astrobytes: Indeed. Bunch of randoms and bestActions[0]/bestActions[actionCount-1]'s accounts for the rest
 iboman: share ur code
 struct: Now i must go to fr and advertise
 Astrobytes: here iboman float tempValue = search(s, depth - 1, alpha, beta, ENEMY);
 jacek: Astrobytes not much. i cached eval things so it is slightly faster
 Astrobytes: Ah OK jacek
 jacek: where do you initialize pruneArray
 Astrobytes: after the search, just before you print the move
 iboman: how do i calculate (in java) how many a square can split with the following input: 2x2 - output: 3
 Astrobytes: Revolutionary method
 iboman: ▯▯
 iboman: ▯▯ --&gt; ▯  ▯ --&gt; ▯ ▯ ▯ ▯ ▯▯       ▯  ▯ 
 MostComplicatedUsername: Astrobytes I was being sarcastic
 Astrobytes: As in the Trump definition of sarcasm or the actual definition?
 MostComplicatedUsername: .
 NViktor01: hello? somebody?
 LelouchVC2: Somebody is here
 LelouchVC2: You've called the right guy for the job
 NViktor01: oh cool idk what i want
 NViktor01: im so bad at coding
 Astrobytes: Fix it
 NViktor01: working on it
 Astrobytes: That's the spirit&#160;:+1:
 NViktor01: :upside_down:
 NViktor01: these little puzzles are soo good
 Astrobytes: Keep at it NViktor01
 jacek: aww
 Astrobytes: Fix your fixable things that need fixing jacek
 jacek: but everything i do is perfect, no need to fix
 Astrobytes: Perfect your perfection then. 
 NViktor01: then you sould really do my things perfect
 Astrobytes: Only you have the power to do that NViktor01
 NViktor01: oh goddamn i always knew im a superhero
 Astrobytes: See? Now get to work.
 NViktor01: ok boss
 JBM: gaimax is true ai
 Astrobytes: Only if you have an array of prunes
 JBM: mmm prunes
 Astrobytes: I actually think prunes &gt; plums
 Astrobytes: Don't get on with plums at all
 Astrobytes: So JBM, what about having the overridable params in the Manual part of the IDE alongside the seed?
 JBM: thay are
 JBM: *they
 Astrobytes: They weren't
 JBM: yet they are
 Astrobytes: Not seeing them? Tried reloading, clearing cache and 3 browsers
 JBM: oh i can't *make* them appear
 JBM: but you can set them
 Astrobytes: what's the constraints on roadLength for it?
 JBM: even, 0 to... don't remember
 JBM: let's say 20
 Astrobytes: Hi, sorry, I crashed
 Astrobytes: Yes it works
 Astrobytes: There's a way to display it though
 Imsure1200q: Help: codingame is not running my code properly&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Codingame is running your improper code properly most likely&#160;;)
 Imsure1200q: But i've copy-pasted it on console and it works
 Astrobytes: Did you change the default code in any way with regards to reading the inputs?
 Astrobytes: Because that will really mess things up
 Astrobytes: Or did you forget to output a newline a the end  of your output?
 Imsure1200q: Like the readline()? I simply split the input into an array. How can that mess it up? Also, a newline is definitely not the problem
 Imsure1200q: Lets say the input is Hello World and the output is supposed to be olleH dlroW. If i run my code in Codingame, the output is Hello World, but if i run in console, it is olleH dlroW.
 Astrobytes: JS?
 Imsure1200q: yes
 Imsure1200q: input is S, which is split into an array of words
 Astrobytes: Paste your code here (don't worry) and someone who's into JS will help you
 Imsure1200q: S.map(e=&gt;(e.split(<i>).reverse().join(</i>)));this works in console, not in codingame
 nicholascc: what are codinpoints?
 Astrobytes: Paste it all, just in case of an error elsewhere (happens a lot)
 Imsure1200q: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5af72ca-5cab-46e2-8fec-eef5bbb69732">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5af72ca-5cab-46e2-8fec-eef5bbb69732</a>
 Astrobytes: JBM, Vindinium runs on the SDK right?
 JBM: i suppose
 Imsure1200q: Is it a problem with a compiler / interpreter
 Astrobytes: Imsure1200q try adding \n to your output
 Illedan: Yes Vindinium runs on the SDK
 Imsure1200q: That will worsen it. The objective is to reverse all words in a string, not add new lines to it
 JBM: ok lemme try something
 Astrobytes: Nice Illedan, JBM check the Vindinium src for how to dispaly the modifiable params
 Imsure1200q: Also i cant add new lines because the time is up but i want to see why its like that
 Astrobytes: Imsure1200q codingame requires a newline 
 Illedan: modifiable  params?
 Imsure1200q: It requires a new line? When does it require? Sometimes, i dont need one.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, like map width etc, in the Options-&gt;Manual section of IDE Illedan, alongside the seed
 Illedan: Oh, the grid?
 Illedan: Oh, the numbers of players and settings
 Illedan: Yeah, check referee class of Vindinium
 Astrobytes: Yes settings
 JBM: will not

 JBM: i'm trying this weirdly-named method
 struct: scroll to game parameters
 Astrobytes: Imsure1200q codingame uses newlines as termination of your output, if you don't supply it, then you'll fail
 JBM: ok it compiles
 JBM: so it's probably right
 JBM: let's push to prod to check
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: The One True Method
 Imsure1200q: I checked; its not related to the output. I did a console error to check if the reversal happened, and it did. But when i console-errored after the reversal of all the words (not individual, all), it went back to Hello World. There is no way that is related to the output.
 Imsure1200q: The log when i checked the reversalHello WorldHelloolleH
 Imsure1200q: WorlddlroWHello World //afer all reversal
 Imsure1200q: and then after that was the output
 Astrobytes: This was a clash right?
 Imsure1200q: How does splitting, reversing, and joining an array need a '\n'? Sorry its kinda triggering me
 Imsure1200q: ya
 Imsure1200q: *yes
 JBM: Astrobytes: it's pushed, but i can't seem to make t work
 Astrobytes: Your OUTPUT to CG requires a newline so it knows when you're finished 
 JBM: i get an empty manual or auto box
 Astrobytes: I'd recommend pinging toad tomorrow, he'll set you right on it I think
 Imsure1200q: Even if i put a newline after, still the same
 Imsure1200q: Oh well its a very random error
 Astrobytes: You need to assign the result of S.map to another vvar I think
 Astrobytes: *var
 Astrobytes: Expected output is 'olleH dlroW'?
 Imsure1200q: haha im stupid (havent slept in quite a big time rn) oh well my bad
 Imsure1200q: effects of sleeping at 5am everyday anyway thanks for telling me the mistake
 Astrobytes: Sorry, I'm really not very up to speed with JS, or I might have been quicker
 Astrobytes: Sleep is good&#160;;)
 LelouchVC2: JS is like coding with crayons
 Imsure1200q: yes very
 Imsure1200q: yeah but its also messy (at least the way i do it) so its kinda confusing for some people
 Astrobytes: I don't *like* JS but it has it's uses, like most things
 LelouchVC2: I was coding in JS for this construction company. As if the language wasn't bad enough, after I finished coding what they wanted they then told me to code it again differently
 LelouchVC2: I was like, "wTf"
 Imsure1200q: Well at least you can shorten your code like crazy thats the plus side of JS
 Imsure1200q: but downside is your code becomes scribbles
 Astrobytes: There's probably a shorter way than you did it, even with assigning to another var. But that's what you do in shortest mode in Clashes
 Astrobytes: Code golfing
 Astrobytes: I don't clash, personally
 Imsure1200q: yes theres a very short way but the clash i was in fastest mode so i didnt care
 Imsure1200q: all i cared was i got it in time
 Imsure1200q: also what was the other mode than shortest and fastest
 Astrobytes: Longest? Um.. I really don't remember tbh, I last clashed years ago :D
 Imsure1200q: nvm its reverse
 Imsure1200q: mode
 Astrobytes: Thaaat's the one. Donno how I forgot that :shrug:
 Astrobytes: I look at the contributions page frequently, I should know that. I blame lack of sleep. Even though I had plenty.
 Astrobytes: Anyway Imsure1200q, it's almost 6am for you? Go to f***ing sleep!!  
 Imsure1200q: nah still energy
 Imsure1200q: its my 6th quarter of school woohoo
 Astrobytes: Well, good luck
 Astrobytes: How old are you?
 Imsure1200q: maybe 7am when its not noisy
 Imsure1200q: so its like when you start puberty&#160;;,)
 Imsure1200q: u know what i mean
 Astrobytes: Well, the advice I would give you is to get some sleep, and study well. Cause you're gonna need the knowledge.
 Astrobytes: You can do all-nighters later when you have to, until then, stay up late but don't wreck your brain for the next day&#160;;)
 Imsure1200q: yes i need the sleep. but i couldn't sleep well because my homework is 100000
 Imsure1200q: i needed to do like 3 homework every night so i ended up sleeping 4am - 5am straight each day for 2-3 weeks 
 Astrobytes:  I will tell you right now, in terms of priorities, rn, homework &gt; Codingame
 Astrobytes: Start your homework earlier
 Astrobytes: Then you have free time afterward
 Astrobytes: Trust me
 Imsure1200q: i dont need to do it rn because yesterday was my last day of school so i will do it when the time has come
 Imsure1200q: my schools system doesn't even make sense 
 Astrobytes: No. Do it first. Then you have loads more free time and you don't need to rush at the last minute and stay up late.
 Imsure1200q: I have one homework left&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: That probably doesn't make sense for you at your age but trust me, it's wise advice
 Imsure1200q: No it makes sense. I've tried fatigue from lack of sleep multiple times and when i sleep it feels good to rest
 Imsure1200q: But the last homework is a two-hour lecture which confused me when i listened to it. i need to take notes, and because its confusing, it will take like four hours.
 Astrobytes: Even tho' you still feel like you can do anything when you've been up for ages, your brain really isn't on point
 Imsure1200q: my whole? family is awake because of the stress from my assignments as well
 Imsure1200q: *whole
 Imsure1200q:  my brother is doing smth so i have to wait for that then i can go to sleep
 Astrobytes: Right. My advice? More sleep. Less Codingame and other distractions until you got what you need to learn down properly. And then do the assignments. THEN you have time to chill, and don't need to stres your family&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: *stress
 Imsure1200q: It's a long story and i cant explain it to you in this chat. But yeah we ended up stressing and stuff; its not my fault tho. Just some weird school stuff.
 Astrobytes: Well, do the best you can OK?
 Imsure1200q: yes i will&#160;:) but my brother still doing something so i'm not sure to go to sleep or not
 Astrobytes: You can try&#160;;)
 Imsure1200q: like hes 1.2 years i think younger than me but hes still awake
 Imsure1200q: all because of school
 Imsure1200q: hes not even puberty thats how messed up it is
 Astrobytes: I'm out, I'm gonna watch something and have some food. Best of luck to you Imsure1200q(sounds like your school system is stressful&#160;:( )
 Burak05: anyone can help me with a small problem in scala?
 Astrobytes: I understand. Testing kids real hard doesn't do much good. Take care buddy
 Imsure1200q: Very. I know that some other americans (mm.. collegeboard) experience stress. But yeah its (i lost what i was about to say)
 Imsure1200q: Okay
 Astrobytes: And get that sleep!
 Imsure1200q: yes i will becuse the sun is bright
 Imsure1200q: beginning to hate it 
 Imsure1200q: alright my energy is -10% and im like a zombie now so ill stop chatting i guess
 MichaelHamilton: Hi, noobie here! I'm trying to code a bot to play a game on this site and one of my functions isn't working. Normally to troubleshoot I start my variables in messages to try to figure out where the problem is. For the games though, as soon as I print something that isn't a valid instruction for the game, the program stops.I'm coding in c# if that makes a difference...
 MichaelHamilton: is there someway i can get a message to be telling myself what the variables are without the program reading it as a move for my turn?
 Scarfield: use error prints&#160;:)
 Scarfield:             // Write an action using Console.WriteLine()
 MichaelHamilton: oooo okay thank you!
 MichaelHamilton: thats exactly what i was looking for
 Scarfield: np&#160;:) normal print statements are handles as your output, so they have to be a valid action. Error prints are not handled though, but you can possibly timeout if you print enough of them, that takes quite a lot though
 Scarfield: handled*
 MichaelHamilton: yeah it makes perfect sense&#160;:) i just didn't know the function Console.Error.WriteLine Found my bug and I'm back to it now&#160;:) 
 Scarfield: nice :muscle:
 MichaelHamilton: okay now I'm timing out. Any tips to troubleshoot that?
 Snef: check how much time your functions uses
 Snef: you need to not spend more than X ms
 Snef: X depending on the game
 MichaelHamilton: how do you check that?
 Snef: use timer
 MichaelHamilton: is there like a function we can use to time our code?
 Snef: I don't do c# but you can check google
 MichaelHamilton: okay i'll google it. thanks

 LachlanB: I just did a technical interview, and I think it was an impossible question with the language I selected. How can I find out more about the solution?
 Q12: What is the question? Is it one of the puzzles here? 
 derjack: good morning
 Hilekat: good moning
 LachlanB: It was a question to find lucky numbers. A lucky number is a number that has the digit 6 xor 8. I had to find how many lucky numbers there are between 1 and a 52 bit int, and I had to execute it in less than 6 seconds, I couldnt get that fast and I dont think it is possible with python
 Hilekat: hi guys, i really would like to become a python developer, i learned all about theory, but in game i'm not good, how can i improve myself where i can learn to improve myself, can you give me some advice please
 Q12: Solve puzzles in python @Hilekat 
 Q12: And @LachlanB This is possible with python. You should find a different algorithm to solve it.
 bini0823: Does anyone knows that how to estimate rank on "CLASH OF CODE"&#160;??
 BugKiller_328: It depends on game mode.
 bini0823: What means?
 bini0823: Ah 
 bini0823: I understand
 bini0823: But I mean not each game but total rank!

 kakaru: java source for bfs, need what?
 derjack: huh
 eulerscheZahl: is this guy trying to sell a BFS code to us?
 derjack: :money_mouth:
 BlaiseEbuth: I think he want to trade what we need against a bfs code.
 BlaiseEbuth: We need to clearly establish what we need guys.
 eulerscheZahl: a contest
 eulerscheZahl: with lasers
 eulerscheZahl: in the medieval age
 BlaiseEbuth: I'll say a contest of contest, and the glorious return of AutomatonNN&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: i would try a sneaky ban on automaton if it ever returns
 BlaiseEbuth: eulerscheZahl is there a way to ban AutomatonNN is it returns?
 BlaiseEbuth: *if
 eulerscheZahl: "is it returns" is fine, Automaton doesn't construct correct sentences either
 BlaiseEbuth: Right.
 derjack: Automaton2000 what do you need
 Automaton2000: how do you do that and i don't want to see it

 BlaiseEbuth: Oh cool. Hold on, I'll grab some popcorn.
 Redlin_Kirill: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: just like in the first 10 matches are critical
 Wontonimo: it is Automaton2000 , but what about the next 10 matches?
 Automaton2000: yea i had to look up a clash just because i don't like how you can get
 Marchete: Automaton2000 is right, the first 10 matches are critical
 Automaton2000: to check if the opponent is
 Wontonimo: "first10 matches" must be a high frequency n-tuple for Autom2000
 Wontonimo: people really don't talk much about the second 9 matches
 Wontonimo: or third 13 matches
 Marchete: I see the first 12 matches, 12 good matches mean high in leaderboard from start
 Marchete: 10 + 1 loss is bad too
 nulte: hmm
 Wontonimo: hm?
 martinpapa69: yo Marchete
 martinpapa69: have you tried training your NN in a more alpha-zero ish style instead of alpha go-ish style&#160;?
 Marchete:&#160;??
 Marchete: how
 Marchete: minibatches?
 Marchete: I have no idea how to do it properly
 martinpapa69: i mean the meta-training script
 Marchete: what meta training
 Marchete: parallel workers?
 martinpapa69: I see you basically have more versions of your NN competing eachoter, and you replace the best ones, when you find a new best
 AllYourTrees: what were the differences other than always using latest instead of competing latest &amp; best, and some sampling stuff?
 Marchete: i have two bests
 martinpapa69: yea, two
 Marchete: and I selfplay AA AB BB etc
 martinpapa69: in alphazero, there is only one NN
 martinpapa69: wich you train continously
 martinpapa69: you are nit waiting for new best
 Marchete: I have "bad" generations
 martinpapa69: you train the nn, with its recent outputs
 Marchete: sometimes I went like 30% winrate
 Marchete: and making selfplay from these
 princess_of_zeal: but you still compare it to the previous version and only replace the best if the new one is actually better, right?
 Marchete: just went worse
 martinpapa69: there are no "versions" in the alpha-zero training
 AllYourTrees: did the authors release any ablation study comparing the "always use latest" vs "keep best"?
 martinpapa69: only one nn
 princess_of_zeal: there are in mine&#160;:-)
 AllYourTrees: afaik they just switched what they did without any justification lol
 Marchete: ah
 AllYourTrees: other than it was simpler
 martinpapa69: you just generate selfplays, and train the network with them
 Marchete: mine it's different
 Marchete: I do snapshots
 Marchete: and only generate samples from "best"
 Marchete: I tried at first generate from "latest"
 martinpapa69: ye i see, its very similar to  what they do in alpha-go
 Marchete: early on my tests
 Marchete: if you want to test it
 RoboStac: I still think theres a high likelyhood that gets stuck where you can't train enough improvement in a single generation
 Marchete: just change the selfplay to always use last generation model
 Marchete: ezpz
 AllYourTrees: yeah things are different when you don't have millions of computers running stuff for you lol
 martinpapa69: i already changed the script, to an alpha zero-like training
 Marchete: it worked?
 martinpapa69: getting the same result basically
 AllYourTrees: "basically"? 
 Marchete: it's a "simple" change as I said
 martinpapa69: but i like it more, because its much more simple
 Marchete: used latest instead of best
 martinpapa69: AllYourTrees like 0.1-0.2 elo difference
 Marchete: 0.2 elo :D
 AllYourTrees: :thumbs_up:
 Marchete: maybe I can change to smth like 40% best 60% latest
 Marchete: or any other percentage
 Marchete: but I'm still puzzled with those generations with like 30% winrate....
 AllYourTrees: i wonder if its something to do with a change in policy or value  causes the games to go in state space where it isn't as good?
 AllYourTrees: :shrug:
 vanerac: a
 Marchete: hmm, maybe it's true about "latest"
 Marchete: the thing may be: "if I can't win best, I need samples about why I can't win"
 Marchete: so I'd learn from the bad winrate
 BIPIN_THE_KING: hello 8th codingamer
 Marchete: I was reading an alternative/similar to AZ: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08439">https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08439</a>
 Marchete: made in about the same time, but without all that buzz
 Marchete: and <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1514096/FULLTEXT01.pdf">http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1514096/FULLTEXT01.pdf</a>
 Marchete: they seem to use alternative UCT formulas
 Marchete: I'm checking them
 AllYourTrees: that thinking fast and slow is interesting, thanks for sharing
 AllYourTrees: i like the comparison to AGZ at the end
 AllYourTrees: AGZ had flashier results than it. ive never heard of hex before, but lots of people have heard of chess and go?
 Wontonimo: i like the idea of having a zoo of previous NNs, in the even that some only cover a subset of the critical lessons
 Wontonimo: then if the new NN is able to beat all previous NNs in the zoo, then it has either learnt all the previous lessons, or it has a superior lesson.
 Marchete: I was using best1+best2+random(from last 5)
 Marchete: but maybe it's true to have more samples from latest
 Marchete: I like diversity too
 Marchete: I think my latest can go very wrong, and only selfplay from it seems risky
 dbdr: I do latest vs best1/2/rnd
 Marchete: that seems better
 dbdr: so adds diversity
 Marchete: latest vs latest only is a no no for me
 Wontonimo: is rnd a rnd selection of a bot, or rnd play?
 dbdr: yeah, calls for model collapse&#160;:)
 dbdr: rnd gen
 dbdr: as in the original script
 Wontonimo: yeah, model collapse
 dbdr: only gen0 is random&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: do you ever do vs non-nn mcts?
 Wontonimo: (that question is for anyone who does nn's)
 AllYourTrees: i do that exclusively
 AllYourTrees: err
 AllYourTrees: for evaluation
 AllYourTrees: not for training
 AllYourTrees: i was initially seeding the replay buffer with random rollouts mcts
 Marchete: only selfplay learning
 Marchete: no external bots or domain knowledge
 AllYourTrees: has anyone looked at using UCT instead of PUCT? or know why AGZ uses PUCT?
 AllYourTrees: i'd assume you can just multiply the exploration term in UCT by probability of action?
 jacek: get rid of policy, use UCT, return to monke
 Marchete: I just posted that
 Marchete: some alternative function to use UCT
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1514096/FULLTEXT01.pdf">http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1514096/FULLTEXT01.pdf</a>
 AllYourTrees: ah the thesis has that?
 martinpapa69: my idea is the more my AI is similar to the best AI in the world (AZ), the better performance it's able the reach :D the guys at google spent a lot of time developing it, and trying out different ideas
 Marchete: page 45
 Marchete: +they have 5000TPUs to play with
 Marchete: +NN model in AlphaZero is completely different
 AllYourTrees: ty marchete!
 AllYourTrees: so they just combine the UCT term with the PUCT term?
 Marchete: residual layers
 Marchete: we don't have that
 Marchete: yes, AllYourTrees
 Marchete: uct + some policy "bonus"
 Marchete: maybe it's worth testing it
 dbdr: "Playing the Game of Risk withan AlphaZero Agent""The zero learning process is basedon the Expert Iteration algorithm, an alternative to the famous AlphaZero algorithm"Title does not match abstract :D
 Marchete: another point that can be improved is to also generate samples from pitplay
 Marchete: no?
 AllYourTrees: i really like this ExIt paper, ty so much for sharing marchete
 Marchete: as you use latest
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 martinpapa69: I dont do pitplay
 Marchete: madness!!!
 martinpapa69: train/sample generation/train/sample generation....
 Marchete: alphazero does pitplay, isn't it?
 AllYourTrees: what is pit play?
 martinpapa69: alpha go does, alpha zero doesnt
 Marchete: it's good to have different approaches&#160;:)
 jacek: btw. i dont use pit
 Marchete: they do
 Marchete: each 1000 minibatches
 martinpapa69: but there is nothing to compare. as you have only 1 version of the nn
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/applied-data-science/alphago-zero-explained-in-one-diagram-365f5abf67e0">https://medium.com/applied-data-science/alphago-zero-explained-in-one-diagram-365f5abf67e0</a>
 Marchete: check "evaluate network"
 martinpapa69: ye thats the alpha-go
 Marchete: ahh sh*t its alpha go
 Marchete: lol
 martinpapa69: :D
 Marchete: my fault
 Marchete: I mixed all
 Marchete: nvm I like the "generation" more
 Marchete: have you changed something more, martinpapa69?
 martinpapa69: not yet
 jacek: winrate :v
 martinpapa69: I dont like the training sample pool modification part tbh. i'll check if i can train the network with the last N replays without any filtering, or priorization or anything
 Marchete: delete all *.dat files, don't use NNSampler
 Marchete: then generate samples
 Marchete: maybe you want to change the pipeline then
 Marchete: make selfplay a daemon
 Marchete: and do stuff in parallel
 Marchete: the daemon will keep last N samples
 martinpapa69: ye, that would be the ideal soulution, but ill start with the simple stuff :D
 Marchete: and it can generate minibatches
 nulte: so many NNs o.o
 dbdr: Marchete, I thought about generating samples from pitplay. one possible issue is that noise is lower
 dbdr: so samples will be less diverse
 jacek: how many sample you get in pit and from how many from 1 iteration?
 dbdr: depends on the settings&#160;:) but currently that would be 1/3 from pit
 Marchete: true, that's why I never used it
 ValidityFail: So has anyone received an offer through CG?
 nulte: sounds like the dream job

 Wontonimo: what game KiwiTae did you get pushed into gold on&#160;?
 KiwiTae: pirate of the caribbean
 KiwiTae: coders
 Astrobytes: Programmatically or otherwise KiwiTae?
 KiwiTae: Programmatically ~
 Astrobytes: Nice
 Astrobytes: For work I presume?
 KiwiTae: yes~ 
 dbdr: bramching factor: 10^6. curious how they will represent the policy network!&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Pirate of the Caribbean Coders eh
 KiwiTae: I was at 27.5 pts  last night lol now almost 29
 Astrobytes: Boosting ftw
 KiwiTae: i dont get it some guy played line 50 battles vs my bot
 dbdr: spam submit
 Astrobytes: They were spam submitting
 KiwiTae: oh nice
 KiwiTae: hhe
 Astrobytes: Which incidentally is how I now test almost every feature so I don't get locked out of IDE matches
 Astrobytes: Limit my IDE plays? Fine, I'll take them elsewhere.
 KiwiTae: he can chain kill me now 
 KiwiTae: i m already passed it hehe
 nulte: same happens in other games
 nulte: i have like  60+ games in a row vs the same player
 Wontonimo: it would be a nice feature to see all the battles vs 1 person rolled up into a summary
 Astrobytes: me in BT probably :D
 dbdr: 4 latter pseudo, hungarian flag?wait...
 nulte: nah on c4
 Wontonimo: perhaps by version of their bot
 dbdr: *letter
 nulte: you can always use <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cgstats.magusgeek.com/">https://cgstats.magusgeek.com/</a> Wontonimo

 nulte: I almost beat you :p
 nulte: its not ept yet
 nulte: just random rollout
 nulte: random with forced captures
 Astrobytes: good work
 nulte: Thanks
 69razer69: this chat isn't as dead as the discord server's chat
 Astrobytes: Either one is dead from time to time
 jacek: or celestia's chat
 Marchete: the problem with discord is that either chat or see the CG IDE
 Marchete: embedded chat is better
 Astrobytes: Multiple monitors ftw
 69razer69: whats coding escape did you gave it a go
 nulte: its like escape rooms
 nulte: coop
 Astrobytes: They were pretty fun, the ones we did
 69razer69: yup i just escaped training its fun ah
 Astrobytes: Definitely gotta pick the right people for your team, that will make or break the experience I think
 69razer69: how is that 
 69razer69: skilled or funny ppl 
 Astrobytes: It's heavy on teamwork and communication. Skilled and people you're comfortable with, yes
 69razer69: got u 
 Astrobytes: Not everyone needs to be good at programming, but problem solving, logic etc is useful
 KiwiTae: or just take a second account and solve it on your own
 KiwiTae: because why do teamwork when you can stay alone :sunglasses:
 KiwiTae: :no_mouth:
 Marchete: :ok_hand:
 Astrobytes: We had a laugh when we did it, doing it myself would've been OK but kinda boring
 KiwiTae: same, we did one with my team it was fun 
 Astrobytes: Was TBali, struct, Scarfield and myself, think we did 3 rooms? Didn't do that last one.
 nulte: oh i forgot to check if a player captures all pieces
 nulte: on win check
 nulte: :D
 jacek: does it really happen though?
 Astrobytes: I haven't seen it happen personally
 nulte: it can happen
 nulte: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/570373111">https://www.codingame.com/replay/570373111</a>
 nulte: astro could have captured my last piece
 Astrobytes: lol
 Marchete: he doesn't have a win by killing all pawns
 nulte: me neither
 Astrobytes: Victory conditionsYou reach first the opponent's home row.You capture all opponent pieces.
 nulte: or i would have pushed instead of going sideways
 69razer69: oware abepa
 jacek: leviosa
 Astrobytes: om namo oware-abapa
 dbdr: Marchete: I tried that state (frame 44) with newer weights, and I play differently
 dbdr: so maybe I learned
 dbdr: but the version in the arena does well against top players&#160;:)
 nulte: NN problems
 jacek: NN problems - losing points to noobs when winning
 dbdr: and maybe it does well because it does some weird things and activates *their* blind spots
 Marchete: yay! I'm lucky then
 69razer69: i am trying a basic minimax for the default bot
 nulte: which game'
 Astrobytes: Oware I believe
 69razer69: breakthrough
 Astrobytes: Man, such a red herring.
 69razer69: no its not owares mood
 69razer69: what u mean
 Astrobytes: A red herring is something that misleads or distracts from a relevant or important question. It may be either a logical fallacy or a literary device that leads readers or audiences toward a false conclusion
 jacek: plot twist: its :notebook: :soccer:
 Astrobytes: So when you mentioned Oware but were actually playing Breakthrough...&#160;:)
 Marchete: paper soccer!!!
 69razer69: no i was reading oware gamerules whe i mentioned it
 Astrobytes: hehe
 Marchete: weird rules
 Astrobytes: lol, not that bad
 AllYourTrees: :barf:
 AllYourTrees: :sick:
 martinpapa69: ye i feel like this game could have been much more simple
 69razer69: u mean breakthrough or oware
 Astrobytes: Oware they mean
 Marchete: oware, weird rules
 nulte: oware
 martinpapa69: too many artificial rules
 Astrobytes: Regarding Breakthrough, I would advise minimax w/ alpha beta as a minimum
 Marchete: at turn 200 do you take your seeds? 
 martinpapa69: would be nice to make a BetterOware game
 Marchete: things like that
 Marchete: BetterOware == rm -rf ./oware
 Astrobytes: In that respect yes, I'll give you that
 69razer69: lol overwhelmed 
 AllYourTrees: what do ya'll think of bandas for nn testbed
 QuickMathzs: sus
 jacek: there are some nns in bandas
 AllYourTrees: :eyes:
 AllYourTrees: is it yours jacek?
 jacek: yes
 69razer69: so do you train the nn here or elsewhere than imports weights n stuff here
 jacek: but i think rono has
 nulte: if boardgame and player == jacekreturn NN
 jacek: b
 Astrobytes: rono lol
 jacek: train offline, copy weights to ide
 69razer69: ok 
 inoryy: jacek how many games do you have NNs in?
 jacek: yes
 Astrobytes: A wild inoryy appears
 inoryy: o/
 Astrobytes: long time no see
 jacek: hmm. oware, bt, checkers, chess, bandas, onitama, c4, uttt, clobber...
 jacek: othello and yavalath are n-tuples
 AllYourTrees: for FPU in MCTS, is the node value `fpu` or `fpu + uct_value`?
 inoryy: impressive! are they highly ranked?
 jacek: most are top5
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cgmulti.azke.fr/players?p=jacek">https://cgmulti.azke.fr/players?p=jacek</a>
 jacek: but some games are new and have low players
 jacek: AllYourTrees normal MCTS?
 AllYourTrees: ya
 inoryy: nice, do you work in AI?
 jacek: normally fpu is some fixed value like 1.0 instead of inf for unvisited node
 Marchete: in alphazero is -1
 AllYourTrees: kk
 Marchete: or loss
 jacek: no, for work i write apps for android. nothing ai in that
 Marchete: in others is -parentScore
 jacek: stuff on cg is my hobby
 Marchete: he is hiring a group of AI supervilains
 martinpapa69: its better to keep ai as a hobby. i worked in it, and regret it to ruin my hobby
 jacek: fpu generally works if you have some heuristic to guess which moves are better than others.
 Marchete: supervillAIns
 dbdr: does NN policy count as heuristic?
 Marchete: inoryy NN is the 2021's GA
 Marchete: almost top10 oware multi are NN
 jacek: yes
 inoryy: hah, cool!
 jacek: before NN craze, heuristics were cool in mcts
 jacek: and fpu helped with high branching factor to reduce to subset of promising child, instead of expanding all of them
 inoryy: is everyone running custom frameworks now?
 jacek: is there non-custom one? oO
 AllYourTrees: ya "import coding_game_nn"
 AllYourTrees: "coding_game_nn.play()"
 AllYourTrees: ez

 martinpapa69: back then you could import tensorflow in python on cg
 martinpapa69: bu for some reason it got removed
 inoryy: jacek not sure I follow the question
 jacek: but then the fire nation attacked
 Astrobytes: Disappeared with the removal of python2
 RoboStac: it went with python2 martinpapa69
 RoboStac: inoryy - I think most are still using tf / torch for training and just doing custom forward stages
 inoryy: oh that guide looks awesome, great job Marchete
 jacek: since no nn libs on cg, people do forward in code themselves
 Astrobytes: I think robo just said that&#160;;)
 martinpapa69: some mini cpp inference lib at least would be nice on cg server
 inoryy: so nobody tried going through model serving?
 jacek: model serving?
 Marchete: I did an AZ/AGZ for dummies like me
 inoryy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/tensorflow/serving">https://github.com/tensorflow/serving</a>
 martinpapa69: i worked with that a bit. but how does it come to cg&#160;?
 jacek: could this work for cg with 100k characters limits?
 inoryy: same way you'd import a precompiled binary
 jacek: people have weights, generally float16/15. also for oware most people have one-hots for first layer. kinda very custom
 Marchete: I did a minimal inference engine, similar to TF, it's also on that tutorial/github
 Marchete: "similar" lol
 Marchete: I mean how you define the model
 inoryy: TF models can be served on tiny hardware so in theory it should fit into CG limits with a bit of hacking
 inoryy: I never got around to give it a go so might not even work but a bit surprised nobody tried it still
 inoryy: PyTorch has similar functionality iirc
 Marchete: at some time I tried TF Lite and some other TF for embeddeds
 Marchete: they were "huge" in CG terms
 inoryy: right, not quite what I mean, you can basically hack into a tier lower than what TF Lite offered which you can think of TF for embedds "with bells and whistles" you don't need and can throw away
 martinpapa69: im pretty sure, that the compiled binary would be still few megabytes at least
 Marchete: I think the problem right now is how to improve performance, NN inference are slow, and CG's turn are small
 RoboStac: tflite is a few hundred kb for simple image stuff
 dbdr: sometimes it's more work to remove the 95% you don't need than to build the 5% you do need
 RoboStac: but still well over 100
 inoryy: to be clear I'm not saying I'm certain it's the better way so don't go off investing time into it, was just curious if anybody gave it a go
 inoryy: dbdr that's probably true
 Marchete: I tried as I said
 Marchete: some TF for embedded devices
 Marchete: trying to strip it down
 RoboStac: I'm also not convinced tf would get near the performance as it's a bit too generalised
 Marchete: the h5 reader was huge
 Marchete: I'm sure Robo 3x the TF performance
 Marchete: at least
 inoryy: yeah, makes sense
 inoryy: damn you guys got advanced so fast
 Marchete: fast :D
 inoryy: now I'm scared to try things
 Marchete: use my framework for oware
 Marchete: ezpz
 martinpapa69: eztop10
 Marchete: that's an skeleton for CG
 Marchete: the idea is to improve it
 Marchete: if it's from a ML expert, the better :D
 jacek: is 20 more ppl will use it, then it wont be ez top10
 inoryy: thanks, I might give it a go once I get some vacation days&#160;:)
 dbdr: everyone can be top 10
 Marchete: probably you are bored of NN stuff, too
 RoboStac: what if we want to be better than top 10
 Marchete: 50 guys can be top 10 
 AllYourTrees: lol
 dbdr: ezpz
 inoryy: I don't get much CG style bot programming that's for sure
 dbdr: technically it's impossible to be better than top10&#160;;)
 Marchete: you become your worst enemy just after you made it
 Astrobytes: I thought &gt; top 10 was CG Premium
 nulte: wtt c4 bot for bt bot
 inoryy: oh, they finally added CG Premium? does it come with special CSB league?
 nulte: that comes in 2025
 Astrobytes: lol no
 69razer69: lol so u astrobytes you said minimax alpha beta minimum i just wracked wooden league by playing the first legal move
 Astrobytes: are there 2 leagues in Breakthrough?
 nulte: which game?
 nulte: there is only 1 league
 Astrobytes: You're 132nd at 38%
 69razer69: breaktrough 
 Astrobytes: 44%
 69razer69: yup everyone is playing same strat
 Astrobytes: Oh are they.
 69razer69: yeah
 69razer69: go see
 Astrobytes: I'm watching my submit right now.
 69razer69: how i can watch you crush me
 Astrobytes: select me as an opponent in the IDE
 nulte: I print a random move and got top 50
 69razer69: wth lol
 Astrobytes: Do that a few times and you might not 
 Astrobytes: somewhere between 80 and 50ish iirc
 Astrobytes: nulte: you're making some illegal moves

 jacek: :police_car:
 dbdr: Marchete: more training or...?
 Marchete: I was trying the alternative UCT formula
 Marchete: with some retrain
 Astrobytes: alternative UCT formula?
 Marchete: from some paper
 Astrobytes: there are a few...
 imathwee: hi there
 NDojo: hello&#160;:)

 Marchete: page 45
 Marchete: but I'm using it only on submit
 Marchete: not on train
 dbdr: while notFirst():
 Marchete: :rofl:
 NDojo: xD
 Marchete: while !first():
 Marchete:   train more
 Marchete:    read papers
 Marchete:    cry
 Marchete: look leaderboards
 Marchete:   train more
 Astrobytes: Interesting reading
 Astrobytes: Saved
 Astrobytes: Not sure it's 100% what you want in Oware but every little helps right 
 Marchete: why not
 Astrobytes: Oware isn't Risk :P
 Marchete: damn! I knew I forgot something!
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 dbdr: page 45 is bibliography
 Astrobytes: Nah seriously though, worth a shot right
 dbdr: not sure it's a good idea to use that as UCT
 Astrobytes: pdf index page dbdr
 Marchete: 45-&gt;35
 Astrobytes: and you have to scroll up just a touch
 dbdr: :joy:
 Marchete: btw CG IDE play is heavily crippled now
 Marchete: very few matches
 Astrobytes: No shit Sherlock :D
 Marchete: luckily I don't benchmark a lot right now
 Astrobytes: I test all my new features in arena now instead
 Astrobytes: If they don't want IDE matches I'll give them server matches
 Astrobytes: 25000 times per day
 Astrobytes: (slight exaggeration there)
 Marchete: only! 24886
 Astrobytes: counting is for mathematicians :P
 Astrobytes: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 Astrobytes: I hate this game
 Marchete: me too
 Marchete: ..and I'm limited again
 Marchete: f it, Astro's way!
 Astrobytes: It's the way forward man. Local play only gets you so far
 Marchete: my local play always keep saying I'm 60% better
 Marchete: it doesn't reflect on arena
 Astrobytes: That's true for a lot of local play, NN or not :D
 Marchete: I'm the best 5yo basketball player!
 Marchete: my mom says so
 Astrobytes: hahaha :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Exactly that!
 Astrobytes: Argh. Fix bugs. Lose ranks.
 KatMan911: any way to tell from CoC waiting lobby what kind of CoC it's going to be - short and sweet or long and hard?
 juice0: if only there were some other way to phrase that question
 KatMan911: Thank you, I do what I can :D :D :D
 KatMan911: But disregarding the actual hardness of CoCs - can you tell from the CoC lobby what type of a CoC it'll be? Reverse, timed, etc.? Or is it just whatever, you either get lucky with the CoC or end up unsatisfied?
 KatMan911: :thinking:
 juice0: lol i think both the difficulty and style are meant to be a mystery until you're inside
 WhaIe: @KatMan911 the game mode (fastest, shortest, reverse) is selected randomly in public lobbies. In private clashes, you can pick the mode
 KatMan911: @Whale - gotcha, thanks. Oh, the mysteries of random CoCs...
 KatMan911: @juice0 - I know, right? You have to wait until you finally get right inside - only then you find out how intense it's going to be. Sometimes you might need to employ some tricky techniques, and sometimes it's just getting quick and dirty, pounding hard at the problem until you finish.
 juice0: if i could only get positive feedback about my CoC performance in real life like i do here, but it's rarely that impressive to have the shortest code or the fastest finish out there
 KatMan911: I know, totally! And even then, you never get feedback right away. That's what bugs me. You might be thinking you've achieved success with 85% of test cases, 80% at least, but much, much later you get a shocker "oh, and BY THE WAY, blah-blah, 0%! Total failure!". At least with the CoCs here you know right away how well you're performing.
 juice0: debugging my CoC here is a lot easier for sure, and i think a lot of it has to do with the differences in the feedback systems, as you just mentioned.  sometimes IRL i can't get my CoC up and running, no matter how easy the test case.
 KatMan911: We all have those days&#160;:( And yet you're always expected to have your CoC perform well, with all the evaluating and the judging, and you KNOW they'll be discussing your CoC if you don't measure up.
 KatMan911: All right, I've had enough CoCs for the day, I'm exhausted. Nice talking to you, @juice0, - nice to see someone understands! :D
 juice0: lol you too.  i'll see you here tomorrow, when you're ready to get some more CoC'ing in

 chandubaba: hellos!
 toby666999: hello
 chandubaba: @cegprakash what is aoe?
 chandubaba: oh sry, i thought you were talking about the stream name, not the game lelz
 chandubaba: hi toby
 chandubaba: howz you?
 toby666999: I have a question
 toby666999: How to pass the security check of CLASH OF CODE
 LelouchVC2: I know it's really hard
 LelouchVC2: Need an IQ of at least 140 to pass those security checks
 toby666999: i have 139...
 LelouchVC2: if u have a vpn on, that'll probably trigger it
 LelouchVC2: damn, so close!
 toby666999: I'm too hard...
 LelouchVC2: Tell that to my wife
 toby666999: ...
 toby666999: I think I should have more practice...
 toby666999: Bye!
 eulerscheZahl: toby666999 i see that you are from China. CodinGame uses google's reCaptcha, which is blocked for you as far as I know
 TrentT: He's a chatbot, very advanced neural network
 GeonuiShin: wow nice to meet you
 AntiSquid: everyone's a chatbot TrentT&#160;??
 GeonuiShin: help me..... making  code is enormous hard
 AntiSquid: ask Automaton2000 he will help
 Automaton2000: it would be the best way to get the data
 AntiSquid: get the data GeonuiShin
 AntiSquid: also get an avatar
 GeonuiShin: thank you
 GeonuiShin: i am starter of coding
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: im a codingstarter, twisted codingstarter
 Automaton2000: click on the bronze league
 TrentT: Automaton2000 What is the best programming language?
 Automaton2000: i made it to wood 1
 [CG]Thibaud: congrats Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i'd be surprised if it was a problem with the way i did it
 TrentT: Where's the NN one?
 TrentT: Automaton2000 Where is your brother?
 Automaton2000: i thought you were joking
 [CG]Thibaud: it replies to its name too. Right AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what is the most problem?
 TrentT: AutomatonNN Is AntiSquid a good coder?
 AutomatonNN: because i was thinking of that guy in the chat that he said that it's an answer
 GeonuiShin: how can i the answer of problem?  i can't  solve the problem
 GeonuiShin: i couldn't even guess
 AntiSquid: which puzzle are you doing GeonuiShin 
 LelouchVC2: He was doing the same puzzle as me
 GeonuiShin: hahah yeah
 AntiSquid: clash? 
 LelouchVC2: Turn a decimal into hex, binary, and octal
 GeonuiShin: lol!
 LelouchVC2: hex and octal were easy, there's c++ functions for them, but sadly need bitset for binary
 GeonuiShin: then if i know way of  turning , i could solve it? 
 LelouchVC2: Yea
 LelouchVC2: But best to look for a function already written for your language
 GeonuiShin: oh thanks&#160;!!!  you are my hero!!!!
 LelouchVC2: Get use to your language and get familiar with looking up documentation
 GeonuiShin: i will try to googling
 iboman: this game is frustrating me...
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: send help pls
 Automaton2000: but i'll wait for the enemy
 DarkRubberDuck_7750: hi guys someone did the temperature's puzzle?
 Gorbit99: ye
 DarkRubberDuck_7750: i can't resolve the last test i mean, i don't know what i'm supposed to do
 Gorbit99: make sure you have all the requirements in place
 DarkRubberDuck_7750: for that test the 't' input is 0? is null?
 DarkRubberDuck_7750: there's no input?
 Gorbit99: when no input given, return 0
 Gorbit99: it's in the rules
 DarkRubberDuck_7750: kk you're right
 DarkRubberDuck_7750: ty mate!
 Gorbit99: nw
 rectifier: firstinp=="0"?0:secinput...
 AntiSquid: wlesavo can make bulls and cows available wthout the validators&#160;? (for offline use)
 wlesavo: sure
 wlesavo: in a few days if its not that urgent for you
 AntiSquid: not urgent
 AntiSquid: just figured out what i want to do, but don't want to code the game before i start the solution :D
 AntiSquid: also will do after contest not now
 wlesavo: remind me if i will forget
 AntiSquid: ok will try
 LoGos: wow landing a rocker with GA is pretty hard
 LoGos: wonder how Elon does that
 LoGos: (/s)
 Uljahn: doubt he used GA
 Uljahn: there are simplier ways and also more robust
 AntiSquid: he didn't do it, he hired someone else to do it for him
 AntiSquid: hire Automaton2000 to do it for you
 Automaton2000: but it is the most efficient way to do it after the contest
 AntiSquid: Automaton2020
 Uljahn: confused with all those new avas, i understand euler now&#160;:/
 anid: everyone has a pacman avatar now :D
 MatInf: .
 Fosfen: Hi&#160;!
 code_maniac: Hi
 Adnmaster: wait, what do you mean everyone has a pacman avatar now?
 JBM: sure
 Adnmaster:&#160;?
 JBM: i have a pacman avatar, you have a pacman avatar, everybody has a pacman avatar
 Adnmaster: wait...
 Adnmaster: still "?"
 Astrobytes: Can't you see all our PacMan avatars?
 Adnmaster: no?
 wlesavo: Pebcacman avatar
 Adnmaster: no
 Adnmaster: i cant see any pacman avatar
 Adnmaster: there must be a bug
 Gorbit99: that's a shame, yours is the fanciest
 Adnmaster: nice :D
 Adnmaster: i can only see the pacman avatar of "anid"
 Adnmaster: noooooooooooooooo
 Astrobytes: Hey Gorbit99, I know you from the OLC discord
 Adnmaster: i have a question, why isnt the chat flooded when so many people use codingame?
 Astrobytes: Wait til later when the contest starts
 Quidome: :D
 Adnmaster: :sweat_smile:
 Uljahn: also there are flood amplification tricks with mentioning Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: my code works for all test cases but when i look at my code for this
 Uljahn: i ate the pacman but I didn't eat no AutomatonNN, oh no!
 AutomatonNN: what is the problem with the same code playing on any other player?
 Gorbit99: oh, really Astrobytes? What's your user there?
 Astrobytes: Gorbit99, 'Astroshytes', I don't post too often, more of a lurker
 Gorbit99: ah, I see
 wlesavo: why so shy
 Astrobytes: Can usually find most info I need by searching on there, plus I'm usually on CG
 Adnmaster: guys is it possible to solve horse racing duals?
 muy31: yeah of cousre it is
 Adnmaster: mine always finds everything except one test case and one validator
 Astrobytes: Nope. Totally impossible. Nobody has ever solved it :P
 LoGos: ^question for those that solved Mars Lander using GA: do you also "land" using GA? I mean my program does pretty good job getting to the landing zone but landing is almost impossible. 
 Adnmaster: its possible
 Adnmaster: i solved it
 Astrobytes: Landing too hard?
 Adnmaster: wait
 Adnmaster: nvm
 Adnmaster: idk what GA is
 muy31: genetic algorithm
 Astrobytes: Genetic algorithm
 Adnmaster:&#160;???????
 muy31: a simplified algorithm
 Astrobytes: Google evolutionary algorithms
 muy31: that changes due to environment
 Adnmaster: ok dont bother to explain i wont understand anyway
 muy31: no its simple stuff to uderstand and implement
 muy31: just google
 Adnmaster: google's what?
 Astrobytes: You'll never understand it if you don't try to learn about it
 Adnmaster: ok
 Adnmaster: im interested
 Adnmaster: what exactly is it about?
 LoGos: I mean the restrictions are to have rotation = 0, |vx| &lt; 20 and |vy| &lt; 40 to land. While my GA can reach the landing zone it has problems with meeting these requirements
 LoGos: especially rotation
 MSmits: I managed to do marslander 2 without GA
 MSmits: 3 seems impossible to do without it
 LoGos: Hi MSmits
 MSmits: hi
 LoGos: Im practicing GA btw
 MSmits: never done one myself, but I know the theory
 LoGos: and someone suggested Mars Lander
 MSmits: hopefully I won't need it for contest&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah, 2 and 3 are commonly done with GAS
 MSmits: 1 can be done with a simple heuristic
 Rafal.Py: Is this chat for the Wood League in Coders Strike Back or for something else?
 MSmits: this is world chat
 MSmits: you can ask about csb here also
 Uljahn: ML3 was the easiest very hard puzzle for me&#160;:/
 Rafal.Py: thx
 muy31: for mars lander 1, i just put 3
 MSmits: there is no challenge specific chat
 muy31: thrust to solve the puzzle
 MSmits: that works too
 muy31: no coding necessary
 MSmits: I just thrust if it goes too fast
 MSmits: probably uses less fuel :P
 muy31: lol
 LoGos: Yeah I know guys. I'm just wondering if when using GA do you also attempt landing with it.I'm currently taking control over the ship when close to the landing zone and that works well.I'm just thinking if there is another way
 MSmits: my marslander optim code is crap, but I love this replay: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/457940281">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/457940281</a>
 muy31: honestly though one can easily solve mars 2 w/ physics
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: you need some heuristics to get over peaks and such
 MSmits: but mostly it's just physics
 MSmits: think I'm gonna take a nap before contest starts
 muy31: you can just simulate where you will be in some time after x thrust, and what your new speeds will be
 MSmits: yep
 muy31: how many turns you will need to thrust to counteract your speed enough to safely land
 muy31: and then you are pretty much good
 Astrobytes: In other words, yes, you can do it fully with the GA
 LoGos: it's not about the result. It's about the method of getting it.
 Astrobytes: Just keep tweaking it
 muy31: but that is GA...
 LoGos: muy31 sorry then I didn't realize
 muy31: no prob loGos
 Uljahn: LoGos: i guess you could add collision conditions to your fitness
 Uljahn: like large bonus if they are good for landing and malus otherwise
 LoGos: understood, thanks!
 darkhorse64: I do everything with the GA or more precisely my fitness function does everything: penalise hitting the ground far from the landing area, if within the landing area penalise bad landing conditions, then reward remaining fuel (my main goal was the optim puzzle)
 darkhorse64: So far my best score is 2338 l remaining
 LoGos: thank you very much!I once "solved" TSP for a school project using GA. It worked pretty well. It's interesting when there is a time limit per turn.
 LoGos: darkhorse64 do you keep chromosomes from previous turn?
 darkhorse64: Yes. The funny thing is that I do not find a solution from turn one but still it goes to the right direction. It takes a few turns to fully converge and even though it keeps on improving the fuel.
 Uljahn: why don't just use heuristic solution and then optimize it with GA?
 darkhorse64: From my little experience, this is usually a very good idea to feed your GA with an approximate solution. I just do not have one
 darkhorse64: in hand
 Uljahn: i've recently published my solution to ML2 in py3 with sort of a magic formula (simplified feedback controller)&#160;:)
 LoGos: Nice! I've been learning about it last semester.
 LoGos: Though on less exciting examples...
 darkhorse64: I now have access to all C++ solutions. DaNinja solved the puzzle in 14 loc&#160;!
 dbdr: solutions are visible in classic puzzles? :o
 struct: yeah
 darkhorse64: If you solve it first and only in your language
 struct: if the player decides to share
 dbdr: I thought that was only for community puzzes
 darkhorse64: I should have written "all published solutions"
 darkhorse64: It should be a golf puzzle
 dbdr: golf/optim/multi&#160;:)
 dbdr: make your opponent crash
 eulerscheZahl: "I thought that was only for community puzzes"how long are you on CG already?
 JBM: there's no such thing as community puzzles
 JBM: there's editable puzzles and flawed puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: and there are sponsored puzzles. these really have hidden solutions
 DanielN: I don`t can solve this puzzle. Please help me!
 JBM: solve another one! problem solved
 Uljahn: git gud ezpz
 DanielN: I SOLVE THIS PROBELM POWER OF THOR- EP 1!!
 JBM: you rock
 JBM: now try onboarding
 Jerzy: Thor ep 1 is easy
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that boring sudoku validator puzzle got approved
 eulerscheZahl: and i was bored at the sudoku solver already
 Uljahn: time to commit sudoku Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i don't even know how it works
 Astrobytes: sudo Automaton2000 -c ku
 Automaton2000: i don't think i'm going to do the same for y
 kid_coding: sudo DFS?
 Astrobytes: *-'-c'
 inoryy: Username is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported.
 DanielN: Please help me on problem TEMPERATURES!! Thank YOU!
 Astrobytes: finger Automaton2000@codingame.com
 Automaton2000: i was using the wrong word
 Quidome: what's the problem DanielN?
 DanielN: TEMPERATURES PUZZLE
 JBM: no need to shout, we hear you just fine
 Quidome: yes what about it specifically
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: not that long, actually :D 2.5 years I think
 MatInf: i have gpt problem with temperatures too, but i have 93%
 dbdr: today will be my first CG-made contest. I'm a newbie, really
 Quidome: OK nice, all test cases int the green? Validator on 93%?
 Quidome: That one is a lot about reading
 MatInf: yes, in validator 7
 MatInf: is problem
 dbdr: Quidome: doing the contest?
 Quidome: sure
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 Quidome: Killing time, answering questions :D
 MatInf: u know what problem?
 Quidome: Moment I am going to look 
 MatInf: at that moment i ended power of thor
 Quidome: which language are you using?
 Quidome: What is the most easy way to shre code?
 Quidome: share
 MatInf: i am programming on c++
 Quidome: cool, can you share your code
 MatInf: ok, wait
 Quidome: wait, let's go into private chat
 MatInf: ok
 MatInf: good idea
 MatInf: but how? i started to use it today
 Gorbit99: if you post here, I can maybe help too
 Quidome: Good I started the private chat for you
 Quidome: Ok, better 
 Quidome: do it here
 Quidome: Didn't want to flood the chat :P
 MatInf: ok wait, because i was trying to make it shorter and i broke something
 Gorbit99: just pastebin the original and send that
 Gorbit99: probably no need to make it shorter
 Quidome: How to pastebin?
 Gorbit99: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/">https://pastebin.com/</a>
 Astrobytes: Just post the code, it pastebins automatically
 Gorbit99: oh, neat

 Gorbit99: hello
 Gorbit99: you didn't post code
 Astrobytes: Just paste your code here MatInf
 MatInf: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/98a5093c-e4fc-4d41-b52f-43a72b4fb159">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/98a5093c-e4fc-4d41-b52f-43a72b4fb159</a>
 Gorbit99: max(0-t, t-0) could be an abs(t)
 Gorbit99: and generally you don't need to write 0-t, -t is enough
 MatInf: ok
 MatInf: but where is  mistake?
 Gorbit99: you don't handle 0s well
 Gorbit99: you can get a temperature value that's 0
 Gorbit99: so you can't use it as a placeholder value
 Astrobytes: Which validator are you failing?
 Gorbit99: I would say just make it into something that's bigger than the largest temp
 Gorbit99: 7
 MatInf: mistake is on validator 7
 Quidome: Two negative temperatures that are equal: {-10 -10}
 MatInf: i have to end at that moment, i can try to be back after hour
 MatInf: bye
 Astrobytes: Was just about to tell him how to use the custom testcases so he could debug
 Quidome: bye
 Quidome:&#160;:)

 Astrobytes: You're doign the contest then MadKnight?
 struct: Is russia taking measures?
 MadKnight: ye
 struct: Last time I saw it was increasing 10k a day
 Astrobytes: cool
 Astrobytes: Yeah the cases are shooting up
 cegprakash: yaay MadKnight is in!!
 MadKnight: but it's bad at taking measures so it's taking bad measures
 Astrobytes: :D
 cegprakash: was missing MadKnight in last two contests
 Astrobytes: Yeah cegprakash
 MadKnight: russia could launch an actual quarantine which includes $$ help for the citizens but instead they took everything from "quarantine" except for the $$ help 
 MadKnight: so now we got fines for stuff but no $$
 inoryy: they denied any issues for too long
 Astrobytes: How nice of them&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Standard behaviour inoryy
 inoryy: it was obvious corona was already there, being so close to china and having many tourists come and go to china during the lunar year celebrations
 MadKnight: when italy was at 100k russia was at 27
 inoryy: back when every neighboring country had an outbreak putin said it's clean as a baby
 struct: yes MadKnight, but that is highly unlikely
 MadKnight: what exactly
 wlesavo: those numbers i guess
 Uljahn: inoryy: looks more like lukashenko though
 struct: those numbers
 MadKnight: i remember checking those numbers one day
 wlesavo: lol
 MadKnight: i saw 100k in italy and 27 in russia
 struct: yeah
 struct: but can you really trust those numbers?
 MadKnight: doesn't matter
 MadKnight: they saw 27 they didn't do anything
 Uljahn: we are going to outperform the US yay :muscle:
 wlesavo: that would be hard, but we will try
 struct: Brazil also in danger
 Astrobytes: UK is... pretty dismal
 inoryy: corona is just propaganda of the opposition in brazil
 Astrobytes: Bolsanaro's response is mind-boggling
 Astrobytes: *Bolsonaro
 darkhorse64: The fools are running the asylum
 Astrobytes: Sadly very true
 DanielN: how to i add the new line in JAVA? New line system.out.println
 Gorbit99: that adds it automatically
 darkhorse64: println adds a new line
 Gorbit99: because it's "print line"
 Uljahn: you mean \n?
 inoryy: \n/
 MadKnight:  /n\
 darkhorse64: \o/
 MadKnight: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: \n7
 darkhorse64: \o--
 fadal: i got a technical assessment coming up soon on this site and i barely understand the questions they asking why cant they just give me a normal technical interview smh
 MadKnight: normal technical interviews are for the weak
 fadal: well im weak&#160;:(
 MadKnight: fix it
 LoGos: CSB gold under 90mins
 MadKnight: solve this puzzle and become strong
 MadKnight: -3vel ezpz CSB gold under 5mins
 MadKnight: what's the questions fadal&#160;?
 wlesavo: MadKnight promotion to silver and gold can be long
 MadKnight: doesn't matter
 fadal: i would if i understand the questions like i practised on leetcode and the structure of questions is completely different
 MadKnight: they can still see that the same code *will* promote
 Gorbit99: believe him
 Gorbit99: csb gold in 5 mins
 struct: Also they might use this site 
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/">https://www.codingame.com/work/</a>
 wlesavo: maybe since interview is tommorow it is gonna be to get bronze on the contest
 MadKnight: u want this job? go get good rank in this PvP competition
 MadKnight: (c)
 fadal: wait u can have pvp competitions on here?
 struct: yes
 struct: bots vs bots
 wlesavo: and interview is held by CG (they wont actually hire, just assigned many interviews to different people)
 Astrobytes: fadal - you can try the example screening about halfway down this page:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/offers/screening/">https://www.codingame.com/work/offers/screening/</a>
 fadal: ill give it a shot thanks
 struct: it is redirecting to CG site astro
 struct: The start trial thingy 
 fadal: yh
 Astrobytes: scroll down
 struct: ah I see the ide
 Astrobytes: And just click on it to activate it
 fadal: man i wish they would just look at my github and look at the projects i built and just be satisfied with that but i guess a perfect world doesnt exist
 Astrobytes: They're testing your competence in problem solving and presumably language fluency, shouldn't be a problem
 wlesavo: fadal there are some really fun puzzles here, try to be positive about it and may be you will enjoy it 
 fadal: yh true its just i get nervous in test conditions... oh well still gonna try my best 
 Astrobytes: Use your nervous energy, it's a good thing. Just be calm and focus on the problems
 Astrobytes: You got this
 fadal: thanks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: No worries, good luck&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: did everyone stockpile before contest?
 Quidome: just got back from the supermarket :P
 AntiSquid: one hour to unload your van
 dbdr: the pros just stop eating during a contest
 wlesavo: thats your secret?
 dbdr: oops
 AntiSquid: i thought pros would automate the feeding process
 wlesavo: no eat till legend
 dbdr: digestion slows your brain
 AntiSquid: food coder IDE CG-arena pipeline
 Quidome: don't eat carbs only protein
 Beerus: i think this contest has high participation

 BenjaminUrquhart: {
 Neabfi: Hey! Do you think it is worth it in the contests in general to do a MCTS instead of a plain Monte Carlo&#160;? 
 Neabfi: I feel like 100ms is short for a MCTS, that will lead to few game move simulations 
 struct: Neabfi depends on the game
 Skolin: well the idea of MCTS  is that there are too many trees to search so only focus on those that seem important. therefore, especially in short time constraints, it should work. In ultimate tick tack toe it did work better as far as i know
 BenjaminUrquhart: there are people doing MCTS in 50ms games
 BenjaminUrquhart: it just depends on the game
 Skolin: but yeah it does depend on the game
 AntiSquid: it depends more on the people than the game
 darkhorse64: Even with 25 ms, I would do an MCTS
 BenjaminUrquhart: how about 1 ms
 struct: even in 1 ms
 Skolin: on which people`? the implementor or the opponents bots?
 wlesavo: you still have first sec
 darkhorse64: I'll wrote a reactive bot
 BenjaminUrquhart: wlesavo not necessarily, it's possible to remove that
 struct: But are you gonna create a game where you cant really use the time?
 wlesavo: well sure, with dynamic conditions
 BenjaminUrquhart: struct maybe
 BenjaminUrquhart: :eyes:
 AntiSquid: that won't happen BenjaminUrquhart
 darkhorse64: On tron, I use less than 1 ms
 AntiSquid: you need the 1 sec first turn, because of other reasons unrelated to the game
 BenjaminUrquhart: nobody said the game had to be usable smh
 darkhorse64: heating the Java Diesel
 AntiSquid: what is it then a guessing game
 darkhorse64: Rock-Paper-Scissors
 AntiSquid: cows and bulls
 Jasperr: doing my first contest in C++
 Jasperr: lets see how it'll go
 wlesavo: bnc is doable in 1ms, not in optimal way though 
 struct: Also minimum turn time is 50ms in sdk
 AntiSquid: bnc&#160;?
 struct: So you cant really go lower than that
 wlesavo: bulls n cows :slight_smile:
 AntiSquid: bloody acronyms
 BenjaminUrquhart: what if I reflect hacks
 AntiSquid: it could have been bayesian network classifiers or some algo name you know
 wlesavo: you can put a sleep command in referee between sending inputs i guess
 struct: no
 struct: timeout is measured on player.execute()
 BenjaminUrquhart: private static final int MIN_TURN_TIME = 50;
 AntiSquid: we can downvote it
 BenjaminUrquhart: can't downvote it f it doesn't exist
 BenjaminUrquhart: if*
 AntiSquid: boycott it before it's even out

 BenjaminUrquhart: hi
 BenjaminUrquhart: Mino260806 which game
 eulerscheZahl: no akshat
 struct: yes no akshat
 Aarcry2.0: The Blue Side 2.0
 dbdr: did you continue Tulips Quidome?
 Mino260806: BenjaminUrquhart why do you want to know the game?
 Quidome: no
 dbdr: I just resubmitted
 Quidome: I got bender 4 on 100%
 dbdr: I'm ready for the contest
 dbdr: ah, nice!
 eulerscheZahl: me too, just created the contest project
 eulerscheZahl: and we have release mode for C#
 eulerscheZahl: :tada:
 dbdr: they just added it?
 Quidome: You were stuck on place 3 dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: yes, check the forum
 AntiSquid: what does that mean in terms of speed?
 Quidome: i am watchin&#160;;)
 Adnmaster: anybody know what the game will be?
 BenjaminUrquhart: everyone says pacman
 Quidome: prince 2
 BenjaminUrquhart: or a variant 
 dbdr: hours before a major event, what a good timing to make a major change
 Adnmaster: pacman but what kind?
 AntiSquid: hard to guess at this point Adnmaster
 dbdr: what could go wrong?
 AntiSquid: it's pacman duh
 Adnmaster: how do you make yout text red?
 Skolin: from the trailer video i was thinking like agar.io, as there was a big pacman eating a small pacman
 struct: Java flashbacks
 eulerscheZahl: and my OOC bot broke because of the language update

 mark7: Where will be the refree available
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: github
 eulerscheZahl: check statement when it's there
 CJDawson: My first coding comp lmao
 Cappefra: do all old contests expire at some point or is there a reason why some are still joinable and some aren't?
 mark7: okay
 BenjaminUrquhart: AntiSquid :eyes:
 Cappefra: like fantastic bits is still doable but not skynet revolution for instance
 dbdr: could the contest be an optim?
 struct: dbdr i think so
 AntiSquid: it can be a 1vs1 duh
 AntiSquid: more likely given coverart
 BenjaminUrquhart: "Difficulty: Contest (BATTLE)"
 mark7: we all will start with wood league 2 right
 struct: Cappefra skynet is availalbe as a puzzle
 BenjaminUrquhart: battle means it's a multi, not optim
 struct: You can use the search bar at the top
 Cappefra: or detective pikaptcha which is also over although it's pretty new
 wlesavo: same as detective picptcha
 BenjaminUrquhart: pikaptcha was a mess
 AntiSquid: mark7 they can had 100 wood leagues or just 1, so really not really
 Cappefra: oh ok so some become puzzles
 Cappefra: cool thanks
 wlesavo: Cappefra check the puzzle section, not every contest is multi
 Quidome: some are starting a clash :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: clash is taboo 
 AntiSquid: what do you mean Quidome&#160;? there's always clash players that ignore the contest
 BenjaminUrquhart: inviting people to a clash during a contest especially
 AntiSquid: they even post clash questions in chat during contest and complain their clash isn#'t working because of the contest
 Quidome: aha, ok
 Cappefra: oooh wait I just noticed, if you try to access them from "contests" it says it's over regardless, but from any other section, like bot programming, they're joinable
 Jasperr: you can easily do a few clashes in 5min
 Quidome: contest seem far more exiting to me
 Jasperr: true true
 AntiSquid: there's nothing wrong with you Quidome
 AntiSquid: it's the clashers
 CJDawson: My first comp help
 Adnmaster: mine too
 struct: akshat
 CJDawson: Wow
 struct: Can you stop?
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok, who wants to submit in CSB in the next 5 minutes
 CJDawson: Wht language adnmaster?
 AntiSquid: *throws life ring at CJDawson*
 Adnmaster: python
 CJDawson: Same
 CJDawson: 3yrs experience here
 Adnmaster: i think python is easy, and simple
 CJDawson: Yh
 Quidome: easy  AND simple...
 Quidome: wow
 dbdr: those mean different things actually

 BenjaminUrquhart: 504 on submit
 Adnmaster: you can use your code editor 
 RockyMullet: so it is litterally pacman
 RockyMullet: nice
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh it's because a million people hit submit at the same time
 Adnmaster: why did you submitt now?

 BenjaminUrquhart: it's really not
 informathemusic: Aight then
 Albeast: wrap around??!?!!?!?!
 RockyMullet: yay fog of war :D
 eulerscheZahl: a torus map @Albeast
 AntiSquid: The grid is generated randomly, and can vary in width and height. i find this a bit annoying
 CJDawson: I can't run my code!
 BenjaminUrquhart: Uljahn "Crossing paths or landing on the same cell as another pac will cause a collision to occur. In that case, the movements of the colliding pacs are cancelled."
 CJDawson: It's stuck on an animation
 BenjaminUrquhart: so there are physics
 mark7: "MOVE pacId x y: the pac with the identifier pacId moves towards the given cell (pacId is always 0 in this league). " can I give x,y, of cells not neighbouring 
 CJDawson: "An error occurred (#73): "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session"."
 Adnmaster: why are there only 31 people in the leaderboard?
 BenjaminUrquhart: because only 31 people submitted
 Adnmaster: ok
 PotatoCoder: too scared bro
 CJDawson: How does this work?
 BenjaminUrquhart: what are the caps for width and height
 akshat: I'm receiving error: An error occurred (#73): "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session".
 akshat: What should I do?
 RockyMullet: will the random bot beat the default bot
 Albeast: relod?
 Ajanx112: whats this _mine variable is it c specific
 Albeast: reload
 CJDawson: Why isn't my code running?
 akshat: tried reloading but same.
 CJDawson: OupsAn error occurred (#73): "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session".
 akshat: yeah same
 Albeast: close all other tabs?
 CJDawson: Rip
 CJDawson: Closing other tabs didn't help
 BenjaminUrquhart: screw this autocorrect
 Albeast: hope and pray that it will work tomorrow
 wlesavo: lol  rock, paper or scissor pacs
 HungryBurger: I had that happen once. You'll probably have to wait 5-10 minutes for the issue to resolve itself.
 wlesavo: so its litterally rock, paper or scissor 
 CJDawson: What happens after clicking play?
 BenjaminUrquhart: it plays
 CJDawson: It's not for me?

 Adnmaster: how did people write code so fast?
 Adnmaster: the contest just begun
 Mentalist: is it safe  to assume that each point that is not a # there is a pellet there unless someone already ate it?
 [CG]Thibaud: Dav1dS do you have an error in the console&#160;?

 Dav1dS: ok one sec
 Dav1dS: also i get this message &lt;Module "entitymodule" disabled&gt;↵
 Dav1dS: works in firefox
 akshat: Which c++ version does codingame uses?
 Gonny: are there starter packs for this challenge?
 tobk: can two pellets occupy the same position?
 c0cainee: poor bilnky
 c0cainee: already left behind
 andrei00001111: From what I've seen codeingame uses GC++9
 Doju: I'm kinda new to this type of programming. What's the best way to store the grid (in python 3)?
 aCat: sumbission takes ages...
 inoryy: numpy array
 Doju: My naive approach would be to have a list of lits with Trues and Falses
 Doju: or 0s and 1s
 aCat: Doju either set with tuples/other structures
 aCat: or dictionary sometimes
 aCat: or as inoryy said array 
 Doju: Okay, thanks!
 Mentalist: any tips for  c++&#160;?
 Mentalist: first contest!
 Uljahn: watch ceg's stream :smiley:
 MindControler: Guys, when is oppenent pac visible?
 eulerscheZahl: 218 lines of code, time to submit it
 andrei00001111: All I know is that '\n' is much faster than endl
 eulerscheZahl: is there another promotion at CSB?
 andrei00001111: Does anyone know the maximum height and width in the Pac Man contest?
 reCurse: No it's just a contest start
 Mentalist: Yeah I did watch that, and whizzed past the first coding bot tutorial
 reCurse: Everyone submits the default code with minor modifications
 reCurse: 222 computing, enough to kill CG
 cmr624: whattup kings
 eulerscheZahl: i modified a lot&#160;:/
 aCat: reCurse but they beat the boss&#160;;]
 Doju: Also couldn't you just throw a neural net at this and  call it a day?
 aCat: I added like 6 lines
 eulerscheZahl: i started by deleting most of the code
 Nanosplitter: Do it Doju
 PandarinDev: Description is wrong, typeId for pac is not integer
 eulerscheZahl: and then copied my OOC to handle the grid
 Doju: Might try it later, Nanosplitter, but I'll just try the traditional approach first
 dbdr:             Each pac is of a given <var>type</var> (&lt;action&gt;ROCK&lt;/action&gt;, &lt;action&gt;PAPER&lt;/action&gt; or &lt;action&gt;SCISSORS
 anid: When is W1 opening?
 Nanosplitter: There is 100k character limit so that makes NNs a little harder, also you can't use tensorflow as far as I know Doju
 Gonny: aren't there usually starter packs?
 Mentalist: /me
 cegprakash:  starting my stream now <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/cegprakash">https://twitch.tv/cegprakash</a>
 Counterbalance: at dinnertime as usual&#160;:(
 Doju: Oooh, that'd make it a lot more difficult, Nanosplitter
 AllYourTorpedos: also the second part you have multiple things to control, you'll have to figure out how to scale your NN (either run it once for each teammate or have a master NN)
 reCurse: NN during a contest :rofl:
 MadKnight: ez
 Doju: Ohh that'd be such a winning strategy though
 inoryy: winning how
 Fosfen: Does a minimax tree would require too much computation, given the fact that you can have up to 5 pac&#160;? 
 Doju: imagine if you made a system with two competing NNs
 eulerscheZahl: you don't win just to throwing in buzzwords
 MadKnight: it usually takes MUCH more than a week 
 eulerscheZahl: just by ..
 Waffle3z: try using blockchain
 inoryy: quantum
 eulerscheZahl: cyber
 Icebox: wow I was so ready with my IoT machine learning AR solution for the net neutrality 
 Skolin: @Fosfen try it&#160;:)
 Icebox: powered by big data ofc
 eulerscheZahl: i will beat you with my industry 4.0
 Doju: yes i know that'd be super difficult and maybe impossible in this timeframe but it'd be very interesting if you could pull it off
 andrei00001111: Also does anyone know the maximum height and 
 inoryy: there are easier and more interesting environments to do that
 blasterpoard: actually, possible positions of enemy pacs are "in superposition" when in fog of war, and finding the others after finding one is something quantum could be useful for
 AntiSquid: have fun with the variable grid size
 inoryy: easier to setup*
 AllYourTorpedos: this is perfect information game right?
 struct: no
 AntiSquid: :D
 Doju: I think only in the first leagues
 inoryy: and the grids are variable length lol
 AllYourTorpedos: F
 Fosfen: Yeah @Skolin I wanna try it but I don't want to lose time if it's known that this wouldn't work :D 
 AntiSquid: yes 
 AntiSquid: F
 inoryy: and multiple pacs to control
 inoryy: that's like the worst possible combination of things for an NN to handle
 Doju: Yeahh true
 AntiSquid: also 1 week, not a month :p
 dbdr: boss #100 after 40 minutes
 dbdr: quite unlike OOC :D
 eulerscheZahl: who wants full rules?
 Doju: I'm still intrigued by the idea though
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8418077ed71a7b5a95ed0be20717ef7385050f">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8418077ed71a7b5a95ed0be20717ef7385050f</a>
 AllYourTorpedos: meeee
 AntiSquid: i mean a month is enough to do your bot, get bored and do random stuff
 Skolin: Fosfen i think another problem with minmax is that you need many steps in to get a result. like if your macmans take 5 steps forward the game has not changed that significantly. so you need to calculate a lot of steps in. or a good evaluation&#160;:)
 dbdr: wait, 4 leagues, starting from wood 2
 dbdr: that means new rules in silver, right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 AntiSquid: no
 Mentalist: quick question. how do i reset the code to default? I made some changes to taking input which I cant undo it seems
 eulerscheZahl: without highlighting of changes
 dbdr: unusual no?
 AntiSquid: are you sure about silver?
 Doju: There's a button in the top right corner for resetting

 MadKnight: nice game
 AntiSquid: i think it's just the way they uploaded it
 Mentalist: Found it. Thanks  Doju
 AntiSquid: set up the folder i mean
 Skolin: @MadKnight nash equilibrium
 Fosfen: @Skolin I see what you mean, so that's definitly try-able, but not optimal / most efficient 
 wlesavo: not having all the pacs on input is a pain
 WildSmilodon: Anybody know what are the max width adn height?
 Skolin: public static int MAP_MIN_WIDTH = 28;
 WildSmilodon: tnx
 wlesavo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a0aee9cd-123b-4f94-ac71-6c3c6a01c696">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a0aee9cd-123b-4f94-ac71-6c3c6a01c696</a>
 wlesavo: 4 players?
 eulerscheZahl: it's a 2 player game
 eulerscheZahl: maybe they were experimenting
 wlesavo: hm, this if (gameManager.getPlayerCount() == 4) is all over the code
 eulerscheZahl: dead code
 MindControler: Whats the max map size?
 wlesavo: probably you right
 eulerscheZahl: i uploaded the final game and there is no way to add a 3rd and 4th player
 informathemusic: It at the top, width and height
 AntiSquid: scroll up MindControler it's in visible range 
 informathemusic: Nvm i thoun thid up
 informathemusic: public static int MAP_MIN_WIDTH = 28;
 informathemusic: *Found

 Uljahn: btw whats the max map size? :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: what's the max pacman size? always 1 cell big?
 jrke: when will wood 1 league open
 eulerscheZahl: when you beat the boss
 eulerscheZahl: and bronze is available too
 jrke: K
 Dav1dS: why does my score say N/A in some places and a real score in other places
 jrke: thanks means wood 1 is open
 KobeL: Beaten the bossm ultiple times, still no rank up nor does the "ranking" seem to work 50% of the time (switches between N/A and a ranking etc)
 Kacper_D: Anyone else is getting 504 error after pressing "play my code"?
 informathemusic: Oh kobe u here too! 
 RoboStac: KobeL - you need to wait for battles in progress to get to 100% (it's very slow at the moment due to number of players)
 informathemusic: You can look it up on google, i think wikipedia has an "HTTP codes" page
 Mentalist: I just submitted and was ranked like 340 something but now its 300 something...does this mean the submissions are getting judged rn?
 informathemusic: Yea!
 eulerscheZahl: will take a while to finish
 Mentalist: ok thanks :D
 eulerscheZahl: everyone playing right now
 Skolin: i often come up with most creative ideas on the bathroom. have one in mind now. not sure if it is a good one though&#160;:)
 aCat: *a while*
 aCat: Skolin wait till bronze...
 Mentalist: nice to know you are in the bathroom Skolin
 jrke: i beated boss various times and my rank becomes smaller than boss and then imediately changes
 Skolin: sure rn i try the "always go left" and greedy pellet solver idea
 Skolin: always turn left*
 Hjax: @Skolin I like your carbot zergling&#160;:-)
 Skolin: i like your sc2 ai&#160;:)
 Mentalist: rn I have the shittiest possible logic. Go after supper pellets and if not available go after random pellets loll
 Doju: Mentalist, well, mine doesn't even look for super pellets :D
 Over9000: Yeah, just nearest pellet
 Over9000: Where nearest is not even real distance calculated from grid
 RockyMullet: I just go where I didnt go yet :P
 Over9000: Just Manhattan Distance
 Mentalist: tho I think I need to go for nearest pellet now, as I'm falling through the ranks xD
 RockyMullet: prob enough for wood 1
 RockyMullet: if I ever finish a match...
 inoryy: whatever you do don't resubmit
 Nanosplitter: I made that mistake...
 jrke: its taking long time for 1 battle due to many players
 jrke: many players
 Nanosplitter: I was 12th until I resubmitted
 RockyMullet: well I didnt have much hope for my previous random bot :P
 Nanosplitter: Oh wait now I'm back to 15th
 KobeL: mine is just stucj on "no battles available"
 codingWhale: Did you make this game, eulerscheZahl?
 jrke: yes when you resubmit some points are deducted then your rank becomes worse then as battle progress it comes back
 baltilius: Hi,  not sure to who to tell this, but default Go template have unused var and therefore error
 eulerscheZahl: no. why do you think so codingWhale?
 RockyMullet: euler loves fog of war, so obviously he did this
 Tiberiu02: how long did it take you to evaluate your bot?
 codingWhale: Because you shared the contribution with the full rules.
 inoryy: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i downloaded the game from github and reuploaded on CG
 jrke: it will take time due to many players submitted at this time wait Tiberiu02
 inoryy: I RockyMullet's version more
 codingWhale: I see.&#160;:) nevermind
 eulerscheZahl: because promotion is slow and i wanted to read it without that ugly HTML syntax and playable&#160;;)
 ArchilA: any ehlp with this pacman thing? how can i check if my x y is wa or not?&#160;:/
 ArchilA: wall
 eulerscheZahl: and my bot is stuck on 5 pacmen, i hav ea bug&#160;:/
 Over9000: You get the grid before the game loop starts
 jrke: heey eulerschezalh are u on wood 1
 c0cainee: love when the game ends with the pacmans kissing each other
 Mentalist: AAAAAAAAAA. I GOT 404 NOW
 Over9000: Save it in two-dimensional array, then look up
 eulerscheZahl: not yet jrke. promotion is slow
 jrke: ya
 VicHofs: Yo guys what is 'value' for the big pellets
 RockyMullet: lol most of my games are time out
 Mentalist: 19
 Albeast: 10
 Doju: 10
 Mentalist: 10**
 jrke: 10 is the value
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm playing with wood1 rules right now
 Over9000: 38 min, 6%
 VicHofs: ty
 jrke: 10
 Over9000: 10 is value
 RockyMullet: im pretty sure I got screwed by the laggy servers haha
 ArchilA: ty
 Mentalist: I can't even load the contests page now smh
 RockyMullet: oh, no, I do crash a lot lol
 RockyMullet: oh, the map can change size
 RockyMullet: oof
 RockyMullet: I did this to myself
 jrke: first time i saw boss rank above 100
 jrke: its 166 rank for boss
 KobeL: my submission doesn't seem to use my most recent code?
 _Logan_: I haven't been able to get my code to even play yet, keeps crashing on submit cuz servers are burning.
 c0cainee: same happened with mine kobe
 KobeL: I coded in distance related choices (that work on the local version) but the leaderboard version doesn't use those?
 BenjaminUrquhart: [CG]ThibaudToday at 12:55 PMwe're adding machines
 Mentalist: k bois im on 171 now. Wood 1 here  come (int 2 hours)
 c0cainee: there's a delay, it fixed itself after the third try
 jrke: hey anybody knows how many battles we have to play
 jrke: in submission
 BenjaminUrquhart: depedns

 BenjaminUrquhart: outstanding move
 Doju: lol Mentalist
 Albeast: briliant
 Mentalist: both of our pacs refuse to back down
 Nerchio: can you block pathways with your pac? i didnt check yet
 Doju: Apparently you can
 _Logan_: yes
 Nerchio: nice
 Doju: as proven by Mentalist :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: once we get more pacs this is gonna get interesting
 Nerchio: this will get very complicated very fast
 eulerscheZahl: but you can get eaten Nerchio
 Mentalist: ;D
 eulerscheZahl: you can turn you pac into rock, paper, scissors
 YourBestNIGHTMARE: :expressionless:frisk
 mesavitae: is that the level 3 rule?
 Over9000: Can others see what the pac is?
 Doju: I'm still intrigued by the idea of competing neural networks but you guys reeeally seem to think it's a horrible
 Nerchio: i will just code greedy algo to get to bronze hopefully :p
 Mentalist: Blink is 205, and I'm 207. LETS GOOOO
 kovi: i hope you surface to avoid getting eaten
 Mentalist: ignore my hype this is my first contest
 kovi: this time i wont start 3 days late
 YourBestNIGHTMARE: ı hope you push on a lego
 moidda: how to view what Im printing to std error?
 Mentalist: open the console

 kovi: wlesavo: nah, its reverse..you move on pellets, and surface refills the map
 moidda: I started in wood 2
 Rafal.Py: thx
 eulerscheZahl: i'm beating wood1 boss already
 jrke: wow
 Over9000: It's getting faster isn't it?
 jrke: means going to enter bronze
 VicHofs: are commands issued through the print function?
 eulerscheZahl: first few hours of a contest are always slow
 VicHofs: sounds weird
 jrke: yes VicHofs
 VicHofs: ty
 jrke: print("Your commands")
 eulerscheZahl: will be much faster after the first wave of submits
 jrke: eulerschezalh whats new in wood 1
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8418077ed71a7b5a95ed0be20717ef7385050f">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8418077ed71a7b5a95ed0be20717ef7385050f</a> check the rules (switch leagues at the top right)
 Mentalist: another quesiton.. i beat the boss in the LB but i am not getting promoted? 
 jrke: and how many people are there in wood 1 presently
 eulerscheZahl: wait for 100% progress Mentalist
 eulerscheZahl: 0
 jrke: Mentalist points are updated after sometimes wait
 jrke: no one except you in wood 1
 Mentalist: ah thanks! jrke, euler
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not there either, submits are slow
 moidda: can a pellet reappear?
 jrke: K
 jrke: no a pellet camn't reappear
 jrke: sorry can't
 ZeroByter: Well I'm at position 75 in wood league just for going to the closest pellet from my pacman, guys this is embarrasing
 jrke: no 
 cegprakash: hey eulerscheZahl I'm streaming rn
 jrke: just pass leauges 
 eulerscheZahl: i'm competing right now
 jrke: and later improve your bot
 jrke: eulerschezalh you are presently 8th
 eulerscheZahl: yes?

 jrke: what's this Mark 7
 tobk: holy cow, coming back after ~1h my submit is at 20%
 mark7: There something wrong with my path finding BFS
 jrke: K
 Uljahn: btw you can be disqualified for code sharing during the contest :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: classic
 jrke: i suggest don't share your codes
 jrke: you maybe disqualified or someone can use your codes
 eulerscheZahl: or you get disqualified, someone uses it and gets disqualified too
 kovi: karliso playing this time
 Quidome: what's the maximum width and height?
 eulerscheZahl: 3
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes'
 sgalasso: Hello, does anyone know if it possible to add dependencies for Rust in the ide&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: not really
 Quidome: no you can't
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>if it's not there, you are out of luck
 sgalasso: ok thanks
 eulerscheZahl: 557 computing :o
 eulerscheZahl: i'll come back later
 struct: yeah
 struct: best choice I think
 kovi: closeai also
 kovi: closetai
 Nanosplitter: Blinky getting closer to 300
 struct: +22 computing on csb
 jrke: there is bug in ranking or overload 
 jrke: struct are you doing csb
 struct: no
 Waffle3z: trying to debug a timeout, adding stderr prints makes the timeout wave function collapse and not happen because it is observed
 fily: hi, help how to play
 jrke: read rules you will understand what to do
 jrke: its easy enough
 fily: trust me i did 
 fily: doesn't make any sence
 jrke: K
 VicHofs: lol
 jrke: you have to eat or collect as much as pellets you can
 Doju: So what type of pathfinding are you guys using? A*?
 E_pur_si_muove: Agree. I doesn't make sense, but fun
 Waffle3z: what doesn't make sense
 jrke: and more than your opponent else you will lose
 PandarinDev: When do you rank up if you're higher rank than the boss?
 Quidome: does anyone know max width and height?
 Nanosplitter: When your submit hits 100% PandarinDev
 struct: its in the referee
 jrke: yes pandarinDev
 blasterpoard: 33x15
 PandarinDev: Ty @Nanosplitter
 fily: thanks a lot
 jrke: huh! 95% battles done
 Quidome: where do i find the referee?
 PandarinDev: Where can you see the&#160;% of battles done?
 E_pur_si_muove: where is the referee? It's not published in the description

 struct: its coding challenge
 struct: you code an ai
 fily: what it jut take an input noting else
 jrke: no you to give output also
 Earthborne: wow, the syntax highlighting scheme changed!
 jrke: where is Antisquid
 Dasio: I would like to start spring challenge, but I'm getting "Dasio has not provided 1 lines in time"I can't see any movement but there is "Standard Output Stream:MOVE 0 4 12"
 informathemusic: I don't get it, will those ranked better than the boss get on a better league or will those beating the boss  get on a better league?
 struct: ranked better
 informathemusic: Btw when will be the next promotion?
 struct: when the submission hits 10%
 struct: 100%*
 jrke: hey change line ie add \n at end dasio
 Dasio: jrke Thanks!
 jrke: it worked?
 Dasio: yeah
 Dasio: I was so frustrated how it could be so slow
 Dasio: Or i though that was the problem
 Dasio: thanks very much&#160;:)
 jrke: K
 DamianS: wrap-around can be only via left-right edge, or up-down as well?
 jrke: welcome
 fily: can you please simplify it
 jrke: i will be promoted to wood 1 i got message
 jrke: :grinning:
 fily: share the fun let's play like u
 PandarinDev: Battles in progress stuck at 30%
 fily: and also good luck with wood 1
 VicHofs: I guess I'm having trouble with info gathering
 jrke: i am at wood 1:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 VicHofs: Is the info a .txt we can't see?
 ArchilA: i still do not get how to check if x,y is unraechable&#160;:/
 fily: am i the only one who doesn't get this 
 VicHofs: definitely not
 fily: oh :sweat_smile:
 fily: u to
 VicHofs: I tried getting the information for pellets into a list but then I get a time exception
 VicHofs: Is this to be expected
 ArchilA: and then go to desired pellet? :O  how do u even do that
 VicHofs: yes
 VicHofs: But I'm getting time outs and idk how to fix it
 jrke: which time out
 VicHofs: failed to receive 1 line
 jrke: K
 jrke: add \n at last of command line
 jrke: means
 jrke: print("Your commands\n")
 jrke: it will work
 VicHofs: ok I'll try that
 VicHofs: ty
 Deadstroy18: i dont undersand that all
 jrke: what?
 Deadstroy18: how to control the pacs
 Doju: Hey, this is a dumb question, but anyways. So in python I like to have a "pos" class with self.x and self.y but i'd also like to have that same class act as a np.array
 jrke: give commands
 Doju: so i'd basically like to have the "Vector2" from Unity
 jrke: MOVE PACID X Y
 Doju: is that possible without a million different setters, getters and all that mess?
 VicHofs: no idea @Doju
 Doju: Basically i'd like to do something like this: pos1.x -pos2.x -&gt; returns some int
 informathemusic: Why am I stuck ay 69% of the battles
 VicHofs: lmao
 informathemusic: *stuck at 60%
 jrke: doju which league are you at
 VicHofs: oh that's less epic
 Hastings: The interaction of numpy arrays and vectors in 2 or 3 dimensional space are numpy's curse
 Hastings: it's just funamentally bad
 Doju: but also pos1-pos2 -&gt; returns instance of pos class with (pos1.x -pos2.x, pos1.y-pos2.y)
 Doju: jrke i haven't submitted anything yet
 jrke: so nothig to worry just make simple bot
 jrke: its very easy to pass wood 1
 ArchilA: i still do not get mechanics of this site&#160;:(
 VicHofs: bruh I can't even get it to go to the closest pellet lmao
 Doju: Okay so i just have to give in to the numpy curse and just do pos[0] and pos[1]
 Doju: that's a shame
 informathemusic: Please "Battles in progress " is stuck at 60%
 VicHofs: it takes some time
 informathemusic: Yea but like it's stuck at 60% more than it was stuck at 50 or 40
 informathemusic: Nvm got it to 70%
 Grudo: lol most of my wood 1 ends with both pacs stuck at trying to get the same pellet for 100 turns :D
 mesavitae: same lol
 aCat:&#160;:+1:
 Doju: I don't have a working ai yet, but do you think it's worth it to optimize the small things like not taking sqrt of distances if possible
 Nerchio: reading the input is usually harder than getting to legend
 jrke: anyone at bronze yet?
 aCat: nope
 JarredAllen: @Doju "Premature optimization is the root of all evil"
 Doju: i could implement that right now and be done with it but i think speed is not gonna be something to worry about
 Waffle3z: euclidean distance doesn't make sense anyway when you can only move orthogonally
 Hjax: theres currently 16 people above the wood 1 boss, but i dont think any are in bronze yet 
 Doju: Okay, thanks. And nice quote, JarredAllen
 jrke: K
 eulerscheZahl: the boss itself hasn't finished the submit
 Doju: Right, true
 Hjax: eulerscheZahl whyd you have to break my win streak, rude
 eulerscheZahl: to promote of course
 kovi: he did the same to me. but then...revenge
 Hjax: i think my current bot is much better than the wood boss, so ill promote as soon as the system sorts itself out 
 jrke: eulerschezalh in wood 1 or bronze
 eulerscheZahl: yout bot was a noob in that game. frame 10, just go down and get the big pellet
 Hjax: my bot is always a noob, its just a few lines of spaghetti lol 
 kovi: like everyone else's
 jacek: i like how 2 pacs are stuck
 jacek: and bouncing each other
 Doju: Manhattan distance implemented. Thanks, Waffle3z
 VicHofs: do the move commands automatically wait for completion?
 Skolin: anyone knows how output in higher league will look like? can i make multiple move commands separated with&#160;; in one turn as usual?
 kovi: even though i was thinking of setting up some pacman codes in advance....but was too lazy
 RoboStac: separated with |, but otherwise yes
 Skolin: ah
 Skolin: kk
 ArchilA: can some1 give me direction&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: no manhattan either Doju. BFS distance
 Grrec: @ArchilA what direction do you need, whats your experience?
 Hjax: i have uploaded a slightly un-noobed version 
 Hjax: aka i changed a constant 
 Waffle3z: manhattan distance as a best case heuristic in an A* search
 Doju: Oookay i've never heard of that, i'll look into it. thx, eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: BFS = breadth first search
 ArchilA: @Grrec it's 0 :D could not figure out how to check if desired position is reachable 
 eulerscheZahl: as to cells next to each other can be far away if there is a wall between
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are doing an A*, i missed that
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/458069739">https://www.codingame.com/replay/458069739</a>
 DomiKo: what are the odds
 eulerscheZahl: just doing BFS from each cell in turn 1
 Doju: Oh, right. For now i was just thinking of using something super simple without taking the walls into consideration
 AntiSquid: what's new in wood1&#160;? not sure if i want to promote yet
 jacek: thats a p*nis!
 Doju: before i do something at least slightly more intelligent
 AntiSquid: ban! Automaton2000 ban jacek
 fvla: read the bottom to see
 Hjax: @AntiSquid multiple pacmans 
 Automaton2000: we dont have a bot that has a good idea to make it possible to get the best possible
 fvla: RPS pacman lmao
 AntiSquid: that's it? just extra pacs&#160;?
 fvla: RPS
 Hjax: thats it 
 fvla: pacs
 Grrec: @ArchilA than if you are complete starting from 0 you can start with a simple approach like: find a random Pallet, save it and move their. If you reached it pick an other new pallet. Every Pallet is reachable and you can simple say "MOVE 0 10 12" to move their, without care about the path at the moment.
 Grrec: This is my approach because im not so good as well. And I think it can give "ok" results for the start.
 wlesavo: damn, so there are translations in map
 AntiSquid: ok thanks Hjax
 VicHofs: how the heck do u implement BFS on this thing lol
 AntiSquid: with ease&#160;?
 VicHofs: -at all-
 Nerchio: bfs might be expensive with multiple pacs later maybe?
 ArchilA: @Grrec just moving to random coordinates makes me sometimes to be stuck. is it possible to knownearest pellet position?
 BenjaminUrquhart: what if I just treat this like tron with extra steps
 AllYourTorpedos: can 2 pacs end in the same cell?
 fvla: no
 MSmits: lol I thought I go take a shower and then my simple BFS bot will be in wood 1, but leaderboard is very busy&#160;:)
 AllYourTorpedos: if they both try to move to the same square do they just not move at all?
 jacek: they just bounce
 AllYourTorpedos: kk
 eulerscheZahl: Nerchio not if you cache it (ignoring other pecs)
 AntiSquid: should have played with your rubber duck and toy waships for longer in the bath tub msontag
 AntiSquid: MSmits
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: msontag
 Grrec: @ArchilA you could calculate the distance between each pallet and your pac. And take the nearest one. Calculation between two points should be easy. But Im wondering that you get stucked. Sure that its not simply a missing update on a new Pallet goal?
 AntiSquid: too many palettes
 ArchilA: @Grrec probably so, coz i do not now how to check if there is pellet nexxt to me
 eulerscheZahl: palettes? do you mean pellets?
 Grrec: @ArchilA there are always many ways to check this. For example when reading all pallets simply check the distance to your pac. If the distance is 1 its exactly next to you. if its 1.4 its diagonal.
 struct: 1.4?
 struct: What distance are you using?
 qx4mX: gotta collect those pallets
 qx4mX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/gallery/k7cCXPg">https://imgur.com/gallery/k7cCXPg</a>
 AntiSquid: look at the message above before asking me euler
 Grrec: Talking about simple coordinate distances for the start. We are at completely beginner level @struct
 struct: diagonal should give distance 2 using mantham distance
 LoGos: ^
 Waffle3z: abs(x2-x1)+abs(y2-y1)
 Grrec: Will check what mantham distance is thx
 Quidome: Manhattan
 struct: yeah, sorry misstype
 informathemusic: I just love it
 jacek: manehattan
 MSmits: rules.forOfWar = false;
 MSmits: in the referee
 wlesavo: lol
 jacek: obfuscation
 MSmits: at least we know there is no fog of war then
 MSmits: just for of war
 Doju: Actually i don't think i need numpy arrays for this
 Doju: i can use my stupid pos.x, pos.y system, yess :D
 Grrec: Wow this is so slow to submitting stuff. Please dont write simpler algorythms and stay at beginner level like me, thanks ...
 MSmits: Grrec it will be mostly like that right now. Rest of the week will be much more quiet
 MSmits: try not to submit when you didn't make any changes
 struct: even play my code is slow atm&#160;:(
 Grrec: Ah, yeah i ment only "Play" not subumit.
 MSmits: I don't mind. Plenty of thinking to do and maybe some coding as well. Or read the referee. No need to waste time
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back/leaderboard?column=SCORE&amp;value=INPROGRESS">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back/leaderboard?column=SCORE&amp;value=INPROGRESS</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: people submitting in bronze on csb
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: promotions
 VicHofs: guys I still don't really get the pellet position thing
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's always csb
 MSmits: it has a x and y position
 MSmits: y increases downwards
 VicHofs: Where is the information stored? Can I take it elsewhere i.e. a list?
 MSmits: thats about it
 MSmits: oh yes
 MSmits: you can take it anywhere
 MSmits: make a class for it, a list of pellet objects, a 2D array, whatever you want
 Hjax: you read it x/y locations from stdin, and then you can do whatever you want with that info 
 jacek: use bitboards. ezpz
 VicHofs: So if I understand this correctly there's a text file that contains this info
 Doju: Is there a better way to having multiple movement logics in the same function than calling other functions with a million if else statements?
 MSmits: just make sure you do read the input, that's critical. The game expects you to read exactly as much input as it tells you to. What you do with the input after, is up to you
 MSmits: your process gets sent the input VicHofs
 Doju: So "calculate_move("random")" or "calculate_move("closest")" for example
 MSmits: you'll have to write that logic yourself
 Doju: and calculate_move being: "if logic == "random": move_random() elif logic == "closest)&#160;: move_closest()
 MSmits: but you can pass booleans
 Doju: or something along the lines of that
 MSmits: or enums
 jacek: wtf is this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8418077ed71a7b5a95ed0be20717ef7385050f">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8418077ed71a7b5a95ed0be20717ef7385050f</a>
 MSmits: thats the game :P
 MSmits: btw, better not post links like that here
 MSmits: if there's something wrong with visibility, you dont want thousands of players to see things they are not supposed to, before it gets blocked
 Joep: The play my code button doesn't work or something?
 Grrec: What can I do against ""Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session"?
 MSmits: you started a game already
 MSmits: with play
 MSmits: it's still calculating
 MSmits: cant start it again
 Grrec: 10 minutes before?&#160;:(
 MSmits: Grrec, just take a break until the servers get their :poop: together
 MSmits: the start of a contest is like this, especially one that is hyped up as this is
 dbdr: why was it more hyped?
 MSmits: the video
 Enknable: video?
 MSmits: and it was announced during the last contest when a lot of people saw it
 Thiesjoo: Hey meneer Smits! 
 MSmits: well visible anyway
 dbdr: yeah, chain contests is a good strategy :D
 MSmits: hi Thies
 le_bra_james: hi
 MSmits: This is one of my students, cool to see you here
 MSmits: Thies that is
 Thiesjoo: Just trying for the PCC team
 jacek: hi!
 jacek: blink twice is msmits is torturing you
 MSmits: Did you manage to join the team? 
 Thiesjoo: I think so. My school says PCC with 7 members
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: thats awesome
 MSmits: I was a bit worried the game would be too hard for your classmates Thiesjoo
 Astrobytes: Oh hey, your recruitment drive worked MSmits
 MSmits: but I think you can do it, since you finished the Labyrinth
 Thiesjoo: I also think i can do it. We have a lot of time on our hands, so we will see
 MSmits: seems like it Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Good stuff!
 qx4mX: in wood 1 everybody just be blocking everthing xd
 wlesavo: MSmits pulled a Cat on this one
 Astrobytes: :D
 qx4mX: does anyone know if this will stay open even after the first week&#160;?
 Over9000: Me blocking three of my pacs in the bottom left: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/458087326">https://www.codingame.com/replay/458087326</a>
 Astrobytes: qx4mX Yes it will become available in multiplayer when the contest finishes
 qx4mX: k ty&#160;:)

 FrankR: sure
 qx4mX: wood 1 yes
 FrankR: just takes some time

 Over9000: wood 1
 Quidome: 39 in bronze

 Hjax: silver is locked right? 
 fvla: These battles are slow...
 dbdr: yes,  no boss yet
 Quidome: no ghosts then?
 Hjax: there wont be any ghosts
 Hastings: fvla: if you click the setting wheel in the player you can pick x2, x5, or x10 speed
 fvla: i'm not talking about that lol
 fvla: i'm talking about the automated battler to get me promoted
 elderlybeginner: Any suggestion for a basic strategy in the contest?
 struct: I guess you can do move to closest pellet in early leageus
 fvla: it is suboptimal game theory to give your opponent advice
 Doju: Atm I'm going for the veery basic strategy of just getting the closest pellet
 eulerscheZahl: yes, gets you to bronze
 VicHofs: I can't even do that lol
 Quidome: oh really
 Quidome: ok, I am on it&#160;:)
 Doju: VicHofs, random pellet, maybe?
 Doju: I tried that though, it's veeery poor
 VicHofs: No I don't have any issues with the logic actually
 VicHofs: I'm just having trouble extracting info
 fvla: so many lulzy moments when my pac and the opponent's are just walking into each other
 VicHofs: is the input() coming from a text file?
 muy31: from the console
 Hjax: whats the name of that runner tool people use to run test games as if through the web ui? 
 Hjax: to test against other peoples bots?
 muy31: it's like typing in the lines
 ZarthaxX: brutaltester?
 Quidome: well, than everybody will be in Bronze very soon....
 Jasperr: Oups An error occurred (#73): "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session". wth do I do now lol
 ZarthaxX: or the benchmark
 Hjax: ah it was the benchmark tool, thanks ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: np
 VicHofs: ok but if I call input() myself it'll  read the first line always right
 Qet_i: what i don't understand, is how to differentiate between coordinates of pacman (x,y) and pellet (x,y)? 
 dbdr: why do you want to differenciate Qet_i?
 cozmo: anyone sees pac's getting "0 visible" pellets?
 fvla: nope
 fvla: if that happens, the game already ended
 RoboStac: or you are in brozne
 dbdr: cozmo it's possible in bronze I think
 cozmo: Im in Wood 1
 VicHofs: I keed getting "has not provided 1 lines in time"
 Hoggins: that should be possible, wht no&#160;?
 cozmo: and still im getting 0 visible 
 perseverent: Jasper are you writing in C?
 Qet_i: so i can give my pacman a goal, which to reach. or does the print always take pellet's position? 
 VicHofs: does the move command already have a "wait" implementation?
 Doju: you need to print out the coordinates where you want your pac to move to
 Csipcsirip: at least tracking performance won't be an issue this time
 eulerscheZahl: no more chucknorris?
 struct: you dont think performance will matter?
 VicHofs: yeah I know, but what I mean is if I give it a difference move command will it stop and head the other way?
 VicHofs: *different
 VicHofs: or will it go there and then move on?
 Csipcsirip: no&#160;:( if u end up at top30 you can't use the nickname chucknorris. 
 JarredAllen: Giving a move command only causes it to move one tile
 VicHofs: ok thanks
 JarredAllen: If you want to pathfind to a location, you need to give it a move command every turn until it gets there
 VicHofs: I keep timing out though
 ArchilA: how the hell do u check if u arrived and move to another location?&#160;:@
 VicHofs: do an if check on your pac's location
 VicHofs: and see if it matches your destination
 struct: any CG staff online?
 VicHofs: the algorithm is fine imo
 ArchilA: and where is pac's location? when i do x and y it does NOTHING
 VicHofs: but I keep timing out no matted what
 VicHofs: ArchilA I'm having trouble with that too
 VicHofs: but apparently it's input from the console
 ArchilA: dammit, i'm going random -_-
 BenjaminUrquhart: lazy
 BenjaminUrquhart: I don't even have an AI yet
 Erblinium: ss
 perseverent: C default code has a bug
 VicHofs: I can't even make it go random lmao
 struct: random is bad
 lNitsua: C defaults bug is just missing an fgetc
 struct: your bot will just go back and forth
 VicHofs: yeah ik I'm not trying tho
 VicHofs: How does timing out work
 VicHofs: can someone explain this pls
 RoboStac: if you take longer than 50ms(1second on first turn) to print a line you timeout
 fvla: i know i said that giving advice is a bad strategy
 VicHofs: So basically I can't run any code before that
 fvla: but please learn to BFS
 moidda: I cant seem to store the position of all the pellets
 RoboStac: you can run a lot of code in 50ms
 VicHofs: idk what's up here then lol
 VicHofs: I'm just trying to assign a list before moving
 VicHofs: but it's timing out anyways
 moidda: Is there any problem in storing all the pellets? 
 wlesavo: 230 lines in wood 2, finally ready to submit
 moidda: Im getting time out for that
 VicHofs: same
 Doju: uhh what
 Doju: im getting "invalid literal for int() with base 10: '0 0'"
 struct: damn wlesavo what are you doing?
 Doju: on a line with just visible_pellet_count = int(input())
 MSmits: bfs seems a guaranteed bronze
 struct: even with no bfs
 VicHofs: how do u implement bfs tho
 Over9000: woooo bronze
 eulerscheZahl: you copy it from your ocean of code bot
 fvla: if you don't know that, go through the puzzles
 moidda: Theres something called GOOGLE.
 MSmits: it's the most common pathfinding search algorithm. It's very easy VicHofs, you can google it
 moidda: Why ask how to implement BFS
 VicHofs: I've heard of A* lol
 MSmits: A* is actually much harder
 RustyCrown: how to make text appear above a pac?
 wlesavo: struct same pathfinding i used i ooc, it just seems to be easy to tune afterwards
 Doju: I think A* is BFS but a bit fancier, right?
 MSmits: yes, it's fancier
 Doju: or a lot fancier, right
 MSmits: and requires thinking
 VicHofs: wait so it's harder?
 VicHofs: wth
 MSmits: not a lot fancier
 MSmits: A* is harder
 MSmits: bfs is super easy
 struct: RustyCrown you print(MOVE id x y MSG) 
 VicHofs: ok so I should be able to figure this out
 VicHofs: ty
 Doju: afaik BFS is just looking at every possible path you can take
 MSmits: can do in a few  lines. Most work is getting the neighbors with if statements
 lNitsua: it pretty much just adds a priority queue to check. I think technically this only uses dijkstra because every movement is 1
 Mentalist: hmm. random number of pacs this is gonna be funny
 Doju: and A* actually applies some logic to it
 lNitsua: so you just incorporate how far you will be from your target
 Mentalist: In bronze, everything is unlocked, right?
 MSmits: yes
 struct: ye
 MSmits: which is a lot i feel. They could have done with another wood&#160;:)
 Mentalist: good, because i dont want my code to go to waste
 struct: bronze will be big this time
 RustyCrown: struct thanks!
 Nerchio: i feel like i am too dumb to do efficient bfs
 MSmits: yeah very different from ooc
 moidda: Anyone facing problem storing the coordinates of pellets?
 MSmits: I dont often get bronze in 3 hrs
 Doju: argh, i still keep doing "if x = True" even though i've been coding for some months now
 ZarthaxX: struct ruined my streak
 tobk: is there fog of war in higher leagues?
 struct: get rekt ZarthaxX
 struct: ezpz
 struct: fix it
 Doju: (as opposed to "if x == True")

 RoboStac: tobk - yes, you can only see pellets / enemies in a straight line
 aCat: bronze rules in readable format if anyone want to peek
 eulerscheZahl: why did you make screenshots aCat?
 jacek: spoiler alert!
 moidda: What is the constraint for width and height?
 aCat: to have outside cg visible format
 tobk: thanks, was asking because it's not mentioned in "whats in store in higher leagues"
 eulerscheZahl: but now the text isn't copy-pasteable anymore
 struct: public static int MAP_MIN_WIDTH = 28;public static int MAP_MAX_WIDTH = 33;public static int MAP_MIN_HEIGHT = 10;public static int MAP_MAX_HEIGHT = 15;
 eulerscheZahl: and saving text as a jpeg, absolutely barbaric
 aCat:&#160;:*
 tobk: but you still know where all the opp pacs are, right?
 RoboStac: nope
 eulerscheZahl: only if they are in line of sight
 Hastings: I've never used java before: is there a quick guide to compiling and running <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/</a>&#160;?
 RoboStac: you don't know what type they are either unless you can see them
 lNitsua: javac "filename.java" then java "filename" pretty sure
 eulerscheZahl: clone repo, import maven project in eclipse/intelliJ
 jacek: Hastings the faster would be to use intellij idea
 eulerscheZahl: it's not a simple javac
 ArchilA: is it impossible to know  that i arrived at x,y&#160;?
 RoboStac: you get your pacmans coordinates every turn
 dbdr: did Waffle3z adapt his profile pic to the challenge, or it was already like that?
 VicHofs: no just check your pac locaction
 eulerscheZahl: adapt
 eulerscheZahl: well done
 dbdr: yes!
 ArchilA:  i know, but i'm unable to do if x == something and so on
 VicHofs: how do I mention someone in the chat
 eulerscheZahl: VicHofs
 eulerscheZahl: type the name
 RoboStac: you need to store them in some way - it loops round all the pacmans reading them in 1 by 1
 ArchilA: @name
 VicHofs: its cause the x for your pacman isnt a global variable
 Hastings: Thanks a ton! 
 VicHofs: its not just auto set
 eulerscheZahl: actually type the first few letters and then hit the tab key
 VicHofs: oh ty
 VicHofs: eulerscheZahl
 solaimanope: in competitive programming C++ is preferred more than Java since Java takes more execution timeHas anyone faced problems because of this?
 ArchilA: if x == 1 and y ==1 does nothing -_-  can someone tell me why?
 VicHofs: they're not global auto set variables ArchilA
 VicHofs: you have to set them as something
 tobk: in case you want o visualize your heatmap (assuming you are using such a thing) PGM format is really nice
 Quidome: execution is not a problem in my opinion, garbage collect can be an issue
 ArchilA: u man 1's?  i did, still nothing... 
 ArchilA: does visible pellet count not go to 0 after some1 takes the pellet?
 VicHofs: I can't share actual code, but you have to use the x and y for something before they are redefined for the pellets
 VicHofs: ArchilA
 Quidome: almost 1000 players submitted&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: do i need to output the pacman commands in a particular order? i mean i output id, so am wonder if i can just do it any order i want
 cmr624: what do u do when u move ur guy to a location but he doesnt move
 AntiSquid: wondering *
 AntiSquid: blackmail him cmr624
 cmr624: blackmail him??
 struct: Ok, if anyone is wonder
 cmr624: hes just being disobedient
 Over9000: Nice, all my pacs blocking each other: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/458107120">https://www.codingame.com/replay/458107120</a>
 struct: You can see from one side of the map to the other
 struct: ffrom the hole
 ArchilA: wow, i just randomly did a code :O but my pac is too stupid&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: so it's a peeping tom hole&#160;!
 MSmits: you get more pacs in wood 1 ArchilA, maybe one of the others will be smarter
 Jasperr: anyone else having problems with "Play my code" occasionally timing out in an HTTP 504? or am i alone here?
 AntiSquid:  but does the order of your pacs commands matter?
 VicHofs: yes
 VicHofs: It's a while loop tho
 AntiSquid: Jasperr mine does too, and i don't know why has nothing to do with the code that's for sure :p
 Jasperr: good to hear xD
 KobeL: AntiSquid, there's some other shenanigans going on with the competition but according to Thibaud they are working on it
 tobk: are there more pellet values than 1 and 10?
 LoganWlv: @tobk nop
 Doju: Ooohh okay now i see why you don't do manhattan distance
 tobk: then I know what to do with speedboost&#160;:-)
 Doju: in addition to being very inefficient it gets you stuck
 Mentalist: This is highly ambitious, but anyone know where I could find the resources to make something like this myself? Not the site, but a game that works like this PvP code.. I have experience in 2-3 game engines
 lNitsua: pretty sure they provide the source code in a github somewhere
 lNitsua: you could peruse that and get an Idea of what's done
 Mentalist: Yeah, they give out github links to hte source
 Mentalist: ill look into it
 Mentalist: thanks INitsua
 Doju: Ooh some really advanced AIs could try to deduce which strategy the opponent is using
 Doju: This is quite interesting
 KobeL: True doju, but runtime on those might be too slow if they have big pacman counts (not sure if they do, haven't checked)
 Doju: lol i stumbled into someone who uses the exact same strategy
 Doju: i think
 KobeL: Very possible
 Doju: This is so damn fun. Why haven't i participated in these before?
 lNitsua: you've been missing out then. I'm garbage and love them
 lNitsua: the last one has been my favorite. Then I think LoC was the next best.
 KobeL: Yea first one for me too, loving it so far
 BJTrumpet: First real challenge for me too
 BJTrumpet: just got into Bronze, this is exciting
 Ken_Fool: My first Challenge too, im rly excited looks like fun. GL to all
 VicHofs: wth I'm getting this with python on the default code
 VicHofs: ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)at Answer.py. in &lt;module&gt; on line 14
 wlesavo: pebpac
 Doju: That's odd
 BJTrumpet: did you accidentally delete an input variable? 
 Doju: Maybeee.. you have commented out a line with input()?
 VicHofs: nope
 BJTrumpet: should have my_score, opponent_score
 VicHofs: yeah
 RoboStac: the defaults working for me - are you sure you've made no modifications?
 VicHofs: yep
 RoboStac: (you can reset with a button in the top right)
 VicHofs: Imma reset again then I guess
 BJTrumpet: honestly, copy/paste into an IDE and reset the code
 BJTrumpet: there's width/height input, row input, then score input
 Doju: Oh, do I need to beat Blinky to climb the rank?
 Over9000: yeah
 rwilson: Doju - technically, no.  Blinky could beat you 100% of the time. But if you have a better win&#160;% in the arena than him, then youll promote.
 Over9000: yeah, beat him on the leaderboard, not in the game
 Doju: Ah, alright. So I need to beat him in the rankings and not directly
 Doju: that makes sense
 Doju: thanks
 Hjax: yeah if you finish your calibration games and you are ranked above the boss, you will promote 
 MaxCompteTest: I wasn't expecting my simple bot to stay first that long
 [CG]Maxime: ooops, wrong account&#160;:)
 Hastings: We're trying, Maxime
 VicHofs: woah I just whooped Blinky's ass lmao
 VicHofs: 69 pellets lmao
 Doju: Oh well I just got an evil idea
 Doju: A bit difficult to implement but a brilliant one :P
 VicHofs: My next goal is to get 420 pellets
 Csipcsirip: haha funny drug number
 Doju: I wonder if it'd be feasible to calculate maybee... a million? paths in the first second
 VicHofs: funny drug number go woosh
 informathemusic: Kobe , hows it going!
 moidda: Submitted my code and won/lost some battles. How do I level up?
 Doju: You need to beat the boss in the rankings
 moidda: the one ranked 1?
 Doju: No, the one highlighted
 Doju: Blinky in the first ladder
 VicHofs: blinky
 Doju: Not sure if the name changes in the other ones
 Doju: Because i'm still a noob and stuck here :P
 moidda: Its still blinky :v
 VicHofs: wait wth tho
 cegprakash: it's Pinky in wood1
 jacek: pie?
 VicHofs: you only move up in 16 hours??
 moidda: But I did defeat one blinky
 VicHofs: It's not defeating moidda
 Doju: Noo, it's in like a few minutes
 VicHofs: u gotta beat him in the rankings
 VicHofs: oh ok amen Doju ty
 VicHofs: can you drop back down?
 JarredAllen: I don't think you can drop down
 VicHofs: ok cool JarredAllen thanks
 moidda: Im in wood2. How many blinkys do I defeat to reach boss?
 Dinca: am I the only one who can't the test spring challenge?
 Dinca: I just press play and it doesn't start....and then I get network error
 JarredAllen: @moidda You hit submit, and then you have to defeat more league participants than the boss to move in
 Waffle3z: blinky is the wood2 boss. if you're ranked higher than it then you get promoted
 JarredAllen: @Dinca I'm not getting any network errors
 JarredAllen: So I think that's something unique to you
 Dinca: ok...let's see what I can do
 moidda: @Waffle3z Im ranked above BLINKY still in wood2. Sorry for bothering its my first time
 perseverent: the default works?
 Waffle3z: you'll be promoted once your battles in progress reaches 100%
 perseverent: just wait
 moidda: Ow. THanks
 JasperV: how do some companies get their logo there?
 VicHofs: heck yuss Wood 1
 VicHofs: Pinky's going down
 VicHofs: are the visible pellets shared globally or ate they visible for each pac? 
 VicHofs: *are
 [CG]Maxime: globally for all your pacs, you have a single program to control all your pacs at the same time
 VicHofs: okeydokey
 VicHofs: ty
 Hastings: I'm on a maven adventure!
 moidda: Promoted to wood1. Thanks to people answering my questions
 GlitchyByte: Hello fellow gam... I mean coders!
 VicHofs: same dif
 angauber: what do you guys use to get the closest pellte, a* seems kinda bloated for 200 pellets
 muy31: math.hypot
 Waffle3z: bfs is good enough
 muy31: i guess
 rcar: manhattan distance. walls aren't real
 muy31: yes
 angauber: what&#160;? you can go through walls&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: my top tier AI:
 BenjaminUrquhart:     public Command getCommandFor(Pacman pac) {
 rcar: no, just being dumb. manhattan distance ignoring walls works ok through wood tiers though
 ZeroByter: in wood tier my ships are constantly getting stuck against each other
 VicHofs: your... ships?
 muy31: lol
 ZeroByter: ah wait this isnt halite, i meant pacs
 ZeroByter: pacmans
 VicHofs: it happens
 ZeroByter: thingies
 VicHofs: write code to deal with that scenario
 ZeroByter: lol good idea i hadn't thought of that
 VicHofs: -_-
 Over9000: Everybody getting stuck before round 50/200: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/458136238">https://www.codingame.com/replay/458136238</a>
 VicHofs: just... ok?
 angauber: replace the enemies witha wall character in the map maybe&#160;?
 ZeroByter: yeh im trying to write some a* code to get pathfinding to where i wanna go but am a noob at a*, never used it before so it's not working yet, but im on the case
 cooljoseph: What is the sight radius?
 BenjaminUrquhart: line of sight
 VicHofs: maybe trying BFS might be better ZeroByter
 ZeroByter: there is no fog of war
 ZeroByter: k ill look into it
 RoboStac: there is fog of war in bronze
 VicHofs: I think you might waste too much time with A* but idk
 ZeroByter: oh crap
 elderlybeginner: ranking battles seems to work slow
 Archibaldo: Is bronze the highest league right now?
 VicHofs: they are elderlybeginner
 AllYourTorpedos: is anyone else constantly getting 0,0 for the scores instead of the scores displayed in the game?
 VicHofs: yes Archibaldo
 angauber: ZeroByter yeah a* with 200 pellets.. it's gonna take some time
 elderlybeginner: is it sever performance, code weakness or too many players at once sending code?
 VicHofs: idk
 VicHofs: you'd have to get a mod for that
 BenjaminUrquhart: the first and the last
 nathanfranke: Who else is putting random changing text for above the pac men
 Waffle3z: what's the command to do that
 Doju: You just add it after the move coords
 Doju: example: print(f"MOVE {pac.id} {x} {y} {x} {y}") displays the x and y coords
 Over9000: Am I blind or is this undocumented?
 Waffle3z: MSG is a command in the source, where does it write to
 angauber: It's now, in debug section
 angauber: over9k
 Over9000: Ah I see there it says it
 VicHofs: guys my stdout is showing my commands spearated by "|" but I'm timing out
 VicHofs: as if the commands aren't working
 VicHofs: what's up with that
 RoboStac: are you putting the newline on the end?
 VicHofs: i feel dumb now
 VicHofs: ty
 Denebil: Or | at the end
 struct: | at end is fine
 VicHofs: actually no nvm not working lol
 AllYourTorpedos: what are the scores read in from stdin? they aren't matching the scores at the top in the replay
 VicHofs: the commands are properly separated by | in the stdout it's just not going
 RoboStac: share a replay?
 VicHofs: from mine?
 angauber: when you timeout your don't see any of your prints I think
 RoboStac: yeah
 VicHofs: sure thing
 Jasperr: is cin.ignore() in C++ necessary?
 VicHofs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458174425">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458174425</a>
 janquo: can others see text over our pac?
 Jasperr: My code seems to fail 50/50 without it
 struct: Now that you mention it AllYourTorpedos I dont know :thinking:
 angauber: janquo yes in replays
 struct: Maybe it was for lower leagues?
 AntiSquid: it's for the input JasperV, 
 aCat: janquo yes when watching the game
 GlitchyByte: Anybody knows what version of Java is this?
 AllYourTorpedos: @struct yeah idk
 Jasperr: ty
 JasperV: @AntiSquid to what is this a response? :P
 VicHofs: MOVE 0 11 10|MOVE 1 25 2|MOVE 2 12 1Game Summary:VicHofs has not provided 1 lines in time
 AllYourTorpedos: i haven't even submitted a bot yet, so just messing around in the editor and the scores are always 0,0
 VicHofs: this is what I'm getting, is it properly formatted?
 AntiSquid: too many jaspers JasperV
 RoboStac: the replay doesn't show anything in stdout
 Jasperr: Yea I realized
 VicHofs: the text is going out into stdout but no commands are being issued
 RoboStac: thats what the other player output in that replay VicHofs
 VicHofs: yeah ik RoboStac
 VicHofs: oh ok
 VicHofs: my bad dude
 RoboStac: theres nothing in the red section
 VicHofs: wait is it though?
 VicHofs: because the numbers don't match
 VicHofs: i.e. the stdout says 11 10, but Pinky's pac 0 moves to 21, 6
 ShannonNorris97: In the contest, once you've submitted do you just leave it and it will battle people on its own?
 struct: int playerScore = player.getScore();
 VicHofs: yep ShannonNorris97
 RoboStac: thats the closest square to 11,10
 struct: I think its bugged
 struct: RoboStac have you seen this?
 ShannonNorris97: Ah sweet, thanks @VicHofs
 struct: The score always gives 0
 VicHofs: oh ok got it RoboStac
 VicHofs: idk what's going on tho
 AntiSquid: why are the submits too fast?
 Over9000: Are you doing very complex stuff? Maybe it's really a timeout? Like A* to 200 pellets?
 angauber: it's 50 ms per turn
 angauber: gotta go fast
 struct: AllYourTorpedos seems like they never update the value that getScore() returns
 struct: This might be a bug
 struct: They update it one time only
 struct: and is on endGame
 struct: onEnd()
 AntiSquid: :thumbsup:
 Over9000: I can never estimate what I can calculate in 50ms (or any time)
 struct: The getScore() returns a different value from pellets eaten
 AllYourTorpedos: ahhh gotcha
 AllYourTorpedos: okay
 struct: This probably will get fixed
 AllYourTorpedos: oh
 janquo: Do the time of computing your battles depend on how many times you've made submission already?
 struct: if they intend to give the value
 AllYourTorpedos: so we'll have to keep track of pellets eaten ourselves
 AntiSquid: janquo i'ts the cg server
 struct: at least for now
 AntiSquid: everything is slow atm
 struct: But from what I read in the statement
 struct: they want to give
 struct: Maybe they just forgot
 ArchilA: why my pac's do not move together? :O
 AntiSquid: report bug on forums
 struct: ok
 angauber: struct what's that function you are talking about&#160;?
 struct: Which one angauber?
 Jasperr: It seems like when I use cin.ignore() I no longer get HTTP 504's lol
 angauber: getScore()
 Jasperr: maybe its luck tho
 struct: getScore()( is a function from SDK
 AntiSquid: i guess there's no rush to get bronze today, submit will last an eternity either way
 KobeL: Agreed antisquid! + leaderboards open up in 3 days+ anyway so plenty of time
 angauber: sdk&#160;? don't you need to read from stdin&#160;?
 AntiSquid: 3 days KobeL? did you mean silver? 
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020/leaderboard</a> here's the leaderboard if you can't find it btw
 Over9000: angauber That's the driver code
 Over9000: Not what you get to see
 angauber: Oh I see
 romrd468: Hi, with CSB what is the optimal times for speed other than straights
 ArchilA: any advice why my pac's do not move together? what kind of print do they want&#160;:/
 Over9000: | separated
 KobeL: AntiSquid yea I mean silver etc, aka rushing bronze doesn't have any perks since you'll be stuck anyway
 Over9000: MOVE 1 2 3|MOVE 2 27 3
 SamuelTheBad: Check the output for your opponent, needs to be seperated by | instead of ending a line for each move
 KobeL: Might as well just wait for everything to calm down
 VicHofs: is our code manually evaluated at the end?
 ArchilA: oh, thank you
 BenjaminUrquhart: VicHofs no
 ZeroByter: got a* workin gyay
 VicHofs: hmm
 romrd468:  with CSB what is the optimal times for speed other than straights
 VicHofs: any mods on?
 AntiSquid: "calm down" and hide till legend KobeL :p
 ArchilA: @Pver9000 unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'str' and 'str'  ;(
 VicHofs: you probably put it without quotes
 VicHofs: ArchilA
 VicHofs: can u check that
 angauber: you ca only concatenate variables that have the same type
 romrd468:  with CSB what is the optimal times for speed other than straights????
 JarredAllen: @ArchilA You're trying to bitwise-or strings
 JarredAllen: I think that's your issue
 VicHofs: so probably what angauber said
 AntiSquid: you already aske romrd468 everyone is busy playing the contest
 Over9000: ... +'|'+ ...
 Over9000: not: ... | ...
 cguzman: any help, two double variables, I do&#160;: a / b and always get zero as result. 
 ArchilA: oh
 Over9000: language?
 cguzman: java
 angauber: are you casting the result&#160;?
 VicHofs: ArchilA looking into string formatting docs could help too
 VicHofs: what language are u using
 AntiSquid: see spring challenge 2020 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020</a> romrd468
 ArchilA: python
 angauber: VicHofs  python I guess
 ArchilA: i have not even finished and it's sending me to submit -_- wtf
 Nerchio: damn wood2 is so hard in pac
 cguzman: angauber, no. 
 ArchilA: whatever
 VicHofs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html">https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html</a> check this out it might help ArchilA
 VicHofs: AntiSquid you're a mod here right?
 angauber: cguzman&#160;?
 cguzman: I just have return a / b; 
 cguzman: and I got always zero
 ArchilA: @VicHofs tomorrow, too sleepy&#160;:/ thx anyway
 angauber: then how do you know it;s 0&#160;?
 cguzman: a = 1&#160;; b = 2; 
 VicHofs: might be an issue with your vars cguzman
 AntiSquid: yes VicHofs why?
 cguzman: because I print the result
 angauber: never wrote a line of java but a and b looks like integers
 VicHofs: AntiSquid is the boss code supposed to be public
 Quidome: int 1 / int 2 is zero indeed\
 cguzman: they are double
 Ken_Fool: mb integer division cguzman
 AntiSquid: nothing to do with me vihofs, i just moderate chat
 VicHofs: because it is and you could just copy it and maybe get to bronze lol
 cguzman: 0,5 no?
 AntiSquid: and it's wood boss so who cares?
 VicHofs: is that a disclassifiable offense?
 SamuelTheBad: i mean, it does say not to copy code, don't see how that's different
 cguzman: ok, I will check ... very strange 
 Doju: I feel like this is a fundamental flaw in my thinking. I need to pass  the instance as a parameter in a method. Is that bad?
 Quidome: return value also double?
 AntiSquid: well not that i know of, but it's a wood boss so eh&#160;? VicHofs
 cguzman: yes
 AntiSquid: you can get better bots copied from streams if you want to copy somethin stronger VicHofs
 VicHofs: yeah good point what I mean is I would recommend anyone having issues getting started to check it out if that's okay AntiSquid
 Ken_Fool: if you divide double by int you get the int division and that result parsed to double, afaik
 VicHofs: I don't wanna copy
 VicHofs: just saying
 AntiSquid: you could just read it 
 VicHofs: Doju how'd u even get to that?
 VicHofs: are you passing an instance as a class attribute or somethign
 VicHofs: *something
 MindControler: I need help: im coding with c++, what is probably my mistake if i get few turns cerr output in one turn?
 Doju: VicHofs so, I'm trying to tackle some primitive method of pathfinding by myself without looking it up
 Doju: I have a Grid class that has a bunch of Cell classes
 MSmits: hmm it is not entirely clear from the description whether a pac can both speed and move  on the same turn
 Doju: the Cell class has a method called get_neighbours(grid)
 MSmits: I assume you need to choose
 Nerchio: poor wood2 bot
 Nerchio: getting smashed 
 Nerchio: 23 place :D
 aCat: MSmits you can't
 MSmits: allright
 Over9000: Well, that's the purpose of its existence, nerchio ...
 Doju: And the Grid class hass a method where I call cell.get_neighbours
 struct: acat are these people from your uni your students?
 aCat: Nerchio he was below 120 hour after the contest started
 MSmits: what if you have speed 2 and you want your pac to move into a corner and end in the same place it started at. Is that possible?
 Nerchio: over9000 i know i just feel bad for it&#160;:(
 Doju: so I need to pass the grid instance to the method
 aCat: most of them
 Hastings: MIndController are you appending std::endl to your debuggin lines? if not then it micht not be getting flushed in time
 aCat: some current students, some past students
 Over9000: Isn't stderr usually unbuffered?
 struct: MSmits I dont think you can make 2 different moves
 VicHofs: hm
 MSmits: no, but you can move two cells
 MSmits: so you cant move back and forth doing this
 aCat: yep you cant
 VicHofs: Doju I think I know what u mean but can't u just index them in some way inside Grid
 aCat: and when crossing junction youre not seing what was there
 MSmits: bit annoying, you waste a speed turn getting to  a dead end
 struct: but you get 5 turns of speed
 struct: iirc
 AntiSquid: are submits supposed to finish before i die of old age?
 VicHofs: like an array with Cells
 Doju: I guess I could but that'd make the Cell method super messy
 Doju: i mean the get_neighbours method
 VicHofs: you mentioned using numpy earlier, did u try that?
 VicHofs: inside Grid
 cegprakash: is it possible to print messages for each PAC?
 VicHofs: yes
 cegprakash: how
 aCat: after command befeore |
 VicHofs: cegprakash just append the message to the end of each respective pac command
 Over9000: append to commands
 cegprakash: cool
 wlesavo: the horde of pacs shouting mudamuda is comming
 Nerchio: haha
 VicHofs: like this: "MOVE 1 21 53 smoke weed everyday"
 VicHofs: cegprakash
 JohnEnitnatsnoc: i want fucking editorials
 JohnEnitnatsnoc: for
 JohnEnitnatsnoc: clash of code
 Astrobytes: no AntiSquid :Pbtw, love the new avatar! :clap:
 Doju: VicHofs umm i'm not quite sure how indexing or arrays would help
 JohnEnitnatsnoc: how should people learn
 VicHofs: wlesavo thanks for the idea
 cegprakash: I don't care about getting to bronze.. I just want to talk
 VicHofs: I'm stealing it
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes pacman nebula
 MSmits: and sing cegprakash
 MSmits: do your celine dion on twitch
 VicHofs: Doju idk I'm out of ideas
 Peudoki: if I exit the submit screen, is it still submitted or do I have to resubmit?
 SilverBlade: 2 pac
 VicHofs: hadn't u implemented BFS before tho? Doju
 cegprakash: I'm tired after a long stream MSmits
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid I know, NGC 281, that's why I like it
 MSmits: ahh ok
 struct: Peudoki it still rns
 struct: runs*
 cegprakash: I just want to chill now
 struct: you can even close browser
 cegprakash: add some cool messages
 cegprakash: instead of adding logics
 struct: after you press submit it will play matches until it gets 100%
 Doju: VicHofs no, I just had manhattan distance and it reeally doesn't work
 AntiSquid: how do you know Astrobytes are you a stargazer?
 VicHofs: right that's what I figured
 VicHofs: I was trying to run BFS but I can't get it either
 VicHofs: if I find a good resource I'll link ta
 VicHofs: *ya
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid used to be, not really into it so much now but I still have an interest
 Doju: Actually you know what? I think what i'm doing is fine as long as it doesn't throw an error
 Doju: aight thanks
 ZeroByter: Just got into bronze and legit gotta implement rock paper scissors logic kill me now
 Hjax: whats wrong with rock paper scissors logic?
 ZeroByter: Nothing really, just kinda complex
 ArchilA: rofl   <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/458206159">https://www.codingame.com/replay/458206159</a>
 MSmits: don't post your pac-orgies, no 18+ stuff please
 ArchilA:&#160;:(
 ZeroByter: :wink:
 Astrobytes: PacBang
 angauber: is there a hole in the rock paper sissors game LUL
 Hjax: that sounds kind of pacaphobic MSmits :P
 MSmits: sorry, it's not very modern of me
 Astrobytes: Pacist
 ZeroByter: Yeah MSmits, something you wanna share?
 MSmits: lol Astrobytes
 Hjax: so when will legend open? friday of next week?
 cooljoseph: Really, this whole game amounts to solving a poisson equation
 AntiSquid: pacman rule 34?
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: can pacs see through wrapped cells?&gt;
 Nerchio: this game should be 18+
 Doju: Okayyy I'm starting to get to the point where I have absolutely no idea what's happening in my code anymore. Sooo, 200 lines in
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/458212330">https://www.codingame.com/replay/458212330</a>
 ArchilA: lol
 struct: Is it me or do games seem too fast?
 Hjax: too fast? 
 Ken_Fool: ^^ that is some party there
 struct: sub 30 turns
 ZeroByter: Yeah why do some games end before turn 200 and no error?
 Over9000: If you have more than half of pellets
 Nerchio: because there is too few points on the map
 BenjaminUrquhart: ^
 ZeroByter: Ah
 ZeroByter: Makes sense

 ZeroByter: iAmSpEeD
 ArchilA: i do not even hope to pass bronze league&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Aim high ArchilA, try your best and you may be surprised what you can accomplish
 PiterYeh: Hi!
 MSmits: pass into or, pass to silver?
 Ken_Fool: get something doing something and that is an accomplishment 
 Ken_Fool: i do not expect to get anything working but i enjoy myself failing
 PiterYeh: Does anybody know if there is a firefox extension to sync my local soiurce file with the codingame editor?
 ArchilA: @Astrobytes no time for it during day. just fwew hours at night...  time to sleep :D
 PiterYeh: i remember there was something like that for Chrome
 SamuelTheBad: PiterYeh <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359</a>
 ZeroByter: Im using that Chrome extension right now
 PiterYeh: SamuelTheBad Thank you&#160;:)
 SamuelTheBad: I'm in the web IDE and it seems to be stuck on a simple if evaluation... maybe I should move over
 solistice: what do you mean "stuck on"?
 SamuelTheBad: I have debug statements before and after the if, it reaches before but never the after, nor the block after the if statement
 Hjax: web ide executes code fine 
 SamuelTheBad: and the if statement amounts to if(1 &amp;&amp; (0 &lt; (0 - 1)))
 Hjax: its just a pain to develop in 
 SamuelTheBad: &gt;, not &lt;
 ArchilA: erm,  how do  use these switch and speed things?
 GreatTux: Q&gt; is the pellet removed from the frame input once eaten by a pac&#160;? Or do I have to figure it out&#160;?
 Hjax: yes you wont get the same pellet in the data next frame 
 GreatTux: thanks
 cegprakash: wait wuut x is columns and y is rows?
 AntiSquid: how to activate SILENCE on my pacmen&#160;? Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: is this chat for the first turn
 MSmits: Game Summary:Only pacs with the SPEED ability enabled can move:
 MSmits: i dont understand this one
 Astrobytes: You need a BitStream and -3 * vel
 AntiSquid: it's part of the puzzle MSmits, figure it out yourself, stop asking others
 AntiSquid: duh
 MSmits: :fist:
 AntiSquid: (idk either, too confusing wording)
 Astrobytes: :d
 wlesavo: MSmits replay?
 Over9000: :vulcan:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458220333">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458220333</a>
 MSmits: right at the start
 Nerchio: damn your game looks different than mine
 Hjax: @MSmits that just means at least one pac (on either team) isnt using speed 
 ArchilA: so , how the hell do i use switch and speed things?
 AntiSquid: yes
 MSmits: ok but why dont my pacs move
 cegprakash: use "MOVE" MSmits
 cegprakash: this is how ppl will troll me
 Hjax: where are they trying to go? 
 cegprakash: I'm not trolling u though
 MSmits: rightly so cegprakash :P
 wlesavo: MSmits its the recap of the second part of the turn
 MSmits: oh
 Hjax: you have to move someone 2 places away, because you only get 1 move command for your 2 "turns"
 Nerchio:  
 Hjax: somewhere8
 MSmits: am i giving them a 1 move command?
 MSmits: when they could move two?
 wlesavo: yes
 MSmits: silly
 wlesavo: they moveone or two steps on the path you printed
 Hjax: i dont really know what you are doing, they seem to stop and go randomly 
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I am messing up somehow
 Hjax: i found printing out their target square above their heads to be very useful 
 MSmits: good idea
 MSmits: thanks
 BenjaminUrquhart: let me guess, text after the command?
 Hjax: yep ben
 AntiSquid: i have a more useful use for the pacman msg
 Nerchio: starts with M
 SamuelTheBad: "wokka wokka"
 Doju: Oh what? I just randomly got into the next league
 BenjaminUrquhart: so "M id Message"
 BenjaminUrquhart:&#160;?
 Hjax: my move commands just look like 
 Hjax: MOVE x y x y
 Hjax: er
 Hjax: move id x y x y
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah
 BenjaminUrquhart: found the edge casev
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458231720">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458231720</a>
 tg44: gosh I hate these rules... playing with a jvm lanng has huge throwbacks... random gc kicks, slow jvm warmup, tha 50ms resp time is super low
 BenjaminUrquhart: this is why everyone uses C++
 MSmits: umm you must be doing something wrong if you are doing the contest tg44
 MSmits: you shouldnt need any gc at this point
 BenjaminUrquhart: btw the referee warms up the jvm for you
 MSmits: unless you already wrote a massive search
 Nerchio: so in bronze you don't get updates for pacs you don't see anymore right?
 SamuelTheBad: yeah, they don't appear in the list
 AntiSquid: and i thought OOC was bad
 wlesavo: lol
 Nerchio: but their id is the same?
 wlesavo: track the pac
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: id shouldn't change
 SamuelTheBad: same for any pacs you lose as well, which is turning out to be the bigger pain
 Nerchio: ah so i can see pac id4 
 LelouchVC2: Is the pac worth doing solo?
 Nerchio: kk
 wlesavo: ids for pacs just range(pac_count) at first turn
 tg44: I generate a pack-dist-value trio for every field, which is sometimes 1ms, sometimes 14 for the same scenario (for one pac, so if I get 5 its easily goes out of the 50ms)
 BenjaminUrquhart: wood 1 on first legit submit, should also get me close to bronze
 BenjaminUrquhart: but only because I designed my system with multiple packs in mind
 BenjaminUrquhart: pcs*
 BenjaminUrquhart: pacs*
 BenjaminUrquhart:&#160;!
 wlesavo: and with enemy tracker
 BenjaminUrquhart: I didn't make an enemy tracker yet
 Nerchio: enemy tracker nooooooooooooooooo
 kovi: and still no torpedo?
 MSmits: will we be able to throw lightning and use the speed force to phase through walls in silver?
 SamuelTheBad: so long as you've put enough levels in faith, yes
 MSmits: mm k
 wlesavo: MSmits at least in this game you can actualy teleport
 MSmits: lol right
 MSmits: btw i know what my bug was
 MSmits: i was doing 2 BFS. Move to one cell and then move right back where i started. Thats why they froze
 Astrobytes: Teleporting again? :P
 Astrobytes: ah
 AntiSquid: fixed messages&#160;:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458243839">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458243839</a>now i am ready to start coding
 MSmits: what are you using so much calc time for
 AntiSquid: check taget destination MSmits
 AntiSquid: funny you fell for it
 MSmits: check to see if is blocked by pacs?
 MSmits: of course I did
 Doju: Apparently you don't need to have a very good algorithm to beat Pinky
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits:  I beat him easily with a "get nearest pellet"  bfs
 MSmits: no brainer bot
 AntiSquid: i don't have any algo, not even bfs
 AntiSquid: bronze with just go to nearest 
 MSmits: oh you just loop over all pellets and set it as destination?
 MSmits: manhattan?
 wlesavo: i got bronze without any distance calculations
 Doju: that's what i'm doing currently
 AntiSquid: well the wood wasn't complicated so no need for stronger bosses to give time to code rules
 Doju: MSmits
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: that seems more work than bfs&#160;:)
 icecream17: just starting so much
 AntiSquid: i guess you can just pick a pellet at random really bosses are exact opposite of OOC
 MSmits: might be
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok, I'm in bronze, time for everything to break
 MSmits: dont think it'll break
 rcar: bronze is not very different from wood1
 MSmits: you will just not use speed
 MSmits: also you will have your pacs scissored, rocked and papered
 SamuelTheBad: mine broke when my pacs started dying, but I've probably done it weird
 BenjaminUrquhart: what happens if I try to command a dead pac
 SamuelTheBad: you lose instantly
 BenjaminUrquhart: cool
 MSmits: it might not appear in your list BenjaminUrquhart
 MSmits: if it is dead
 BenjaminUrquhart: I cache them though
 AntiSquid: lots of things can break in bronze
 LelouchVC2: Is the pac worth doing solo&#160;:((
 AntiSquid: pacs die, you suffer from bloody fog
 AntiSquid: and so on
 MSmits: BenjaminUrquhart then cache them as being dead and don't give them orders
 cegprakash: Bronze here I come
 MSmits: at the beginning of your turn set all pacs dead and only set them alive if they are in the list
 icecream17: where is the game protocol section
 tg44: hmm I changed sets to lists annd some lines went from 6ms to 0.03ms&#160;:(
 MSmits: sets are bad to loop over
 LelouchVC2: alright then
 cegprakash: oh no fog of war.. enemy prediction yet again&#160;:@&#160;:@
 MSmits: no it's for of war
 SamuelTheBad: MSmits not meant for me, but that's way less complicated than I was doing, good plan
 MSmits: public class LeagueRules {
 wlesavo: if of war
 MSmits: SamuelTheBad cool
 kovi: psyho on cg?
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl you brought in Psyho here
 cegprakash: :O
 Astrobytes: I thought he left CG?
 AntiSquid: ping him more
 Illedan: Who is psy ho?
 LelouchVC2: do black people have souls?
 Astrobytes: You've never seen him on other CP sites/competitions Illedan?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8418170c3da50805c6b4d74c4b360e70a1ba3f">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8418170c3da50805c6b4d74c4b360e70a1ba3f</a> lol cute
 Illedan: Nope
 Astrobytes: LelouchVC2 can you stop trying to bait everyone with semi-racist/racist comments every day please
 AntiSquid: LelouchVC2 that one's mean 
 AntiSquid: south park jokes don't really work sorry 
 Astrobytes: Jokes out of context don't work, end of story.
 AntiSquid: and i'd say no because i don't think souls exist
 LelouchVC2: LOL, only reply when I say racist stuff
 AntiSquid: i replied other time too, don't be such an attention seeker
 Astrobytes: I've replied to you previously without a racist comment from you, please do something more constructive 
 AntiSquid: some of the other jokes weren't bad though
 MadKnight: stop seeking for attention Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: if you look at the difference in the end of the game
 icecream17: Oops - I named something "Square" instead of "Cell" and didn't notice until now.
 StuykSoft: Anyone have a link to the original code? Accidentally yeeted a bit of it.
 AntiSquid: LelouchVC2 are you playing the contest?
 MadKnight: StuykSoft just hit Reset code button
 icecream17: Press the arrow that's looks like "reload" at the top right of the editor
 StuykSoft: I don't want to lose all my code lmao
 icecream17: Copy it
 MadKnight: u got history of submits
 StuykSoft: *heavy breathing*
 Counterbalance: hmmm..inital maze size: 35 x 17
 Illedan: :D
 Counterbalance: what are the max map dimensions?
 AntiSquid: ya that got me too
 AntiSquid: really annoying
 LelouchVC2: No it's what I was asking about
 icecream17: Ctrl+C Windows+R "notepad" Enter Ctrl+V Ctrl+S "quicksave" Enter
 LelouchVC2: I'm not an attention seeker, but that doesn't mean I wanna be depraved&#160;;)
 BenjaminUrquhart:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: no, install visual studio and save code through visual studio&#160;! then create a local git repo and commit it there icecream17
 LelouchVC2: If you've answered, i didn't see it
 struct: it is meant to be done solo
 AntiSquid: what do you mean solo&#160;?
 LelouchVC2: It should be done solo? I thought it was a group thing
 AntiSquid: all contests are solo
 Astrobytes: LelouchVC2 It's a multiplayer contest, only you can write your bot
 icecream17: Well, I have atom, but in my opinion the codingame ide is good enough.
 LelouchVC2: :o i see
 LelouchVC2: thanks ,3
 LelouchVC2: &lt;3*
 Counterbalance: is the referee on CG not the actual referee or something?
 AntiSquid: icecream17 the current editor is same as visual studio code it seems, so you could use that locally if you wanted to
 PowerPixel: there's also this, but it's in beta&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614</a>
 icecream17: you changed your profile, interesting
 AntiSquid: me&#160;? pacman nebula
 icecream17: It got the sync beta extension awhile ago
 icecream17: But it took me a week until I figured out how it works.
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/iBhyLBJ">https://imgur.com/a/iBhyLBJ</a> Even though all I had to do was press the button right there
 PowerPixel: i personally like the CG IDE, even though it doesn't compete with Eclipse imo
 LelouchVC2: It always turns my else statements into some weird function
 LelouchVC2: CG IDE is my biggest enemy
 icecream17: what language
 cegprakash: I miss MadKnight
 LelouchVC2: C++
 BenjaminUrquhart: the new autocomplete is a hot mess
 cegprakash: MadKnight stop hiding ur bot
 MadKnight: i'm not i'm still doing stuff
 AntiSquid: pacmen should shoot elemental missiles, ice fire lightning ... etcchange my mind
 icecream17: I used to have it, but I think pressed some keyboard thing and it  doesn't autocomplete anymore
 cegprakash: I love paper type more 
 cegprakash: scissor type looks like a fish
 NormantasStankevicius: Is it me, but this contest for me is running into some UNusual crashes when testing code? might be the new UI changes???
 elderlybeginner: how do you serve pacmans jamming?
 NormantasStankevicius: it's something microsoft C# based tho
 Zenoscave: Like CoreCLR issues?
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah I think so
 Over9000: Just got this on stderr, and then timeout: /usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily unavailable
 Zenoscave: I'm having C# bail a bit on occation too
 Astrobytes: They updated it
 NormantasStankevicius: these new ui changes are quite good, just I feel quite weird when they have datatypes with their name both being blue
 Astrobytes: And some stuff isn't working
 NormantasStankevicius: I opened this code and I said WT*
 NormantasStankevicius: everything was blue
 AntiSquid: so if rock BLUE collides with scissors and paper RED, do they all die? not very clear statement
 icecream17: I wish there was a way to customize Codingame IDE
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah
 Astrobytes: icecream17 I think they are working on more customisation options for it
 angauber: anynone having /usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily unavailable
 NormantasStankevicius: NAISU!
 NormantasStankevicius: angauber I think someone stated having that, try running the code again, I think it's new update bugs
 struct: paper red should not die right AntiSquid?
 Over9000: That was me angauber
 Over9000: Running again, no repro
 AntiSquid: ya ok, do both of the other 2 die struct&#160;?
 angauber: did you fix it Over9000&#160;?
 struct: Im gonna try to find
 struct: give me a bit
 Astrobytes: 1
 Over9000: Just run again angauber
 Astrobytes: @struct
 Hastings: Alas, it is time to make my code actually remember the maze
 Hastings: I had hoped this day would never come
 NormantasStankevicius: what?
 NormantasStankevicius: you mean store it in a grid?
 Hastings: ye
 NormantasStankevicius: ahhh that is quite standard tho, a bit annoying sometimes
 NormantasStankevicius: but powerful
 Hastings: I've reached 33rd in bronze by just going to the nearest pellet, but I don't expect to go much further without some kind of intelligence
 LelouchVC2: Umm
 LelouchVC2: When it says "Looks like you're ready for the Arena"
 LelouchVC2: If I submit now what'll happen?
 AntiSquid: click submit
 AntiSquid: find out
 LelouchVC2:&#160;;-;
 LelouchVC2: You're putting my life in danger
 AntiSquid: JUST DO IT

 AntiSquid: eatCherries();
 struct: cherri = big pellete
 SamuelTheBad: Is it even PacMan without ghosts though
 AntiSquid: ya i noticed that ealier no ghosts
 icecream17: i hope i'm not rushing in this contest in the wrong way
 struct: Game looks fine to me as it is
 LelouchVC2: won 9 out of 13
 LelouchVC2: Is what I think this means
 struct: Only thing I would like would be bigger maps
 rcar: +cannibal pacmen, -ghosts
 icecream17: Ooh, what about those ghost that move randomly but earn you points?
 LelouchVC2: Is blinky a bot?
 Over9000: yea
 LelouchVC2: nice, i like blinky
 Over9000: You have to be ranked better than him to advance to next league
 LelouchVC2: I see :O
 Over9000: Can I do SPEED and MOVE for same pac on same turn?
 struct: no
 Over9000: I see
 Rafal.Py: I started getting the following error: Standard Error Stream:/usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily unavailable
 Over9000: Worked for me at least
 LelouchVC2: How do you know the position of your pac?
 icecream17: Next visiblePacCount lines: Six integers:pacId: the pac's unique idmine: the pac's owner (1 if this pac is yours, 0 otherwise)x &amp; y: the pac's position
 LelouchVC2: Ahh, thanks!
 SamuelTheBad: Being able to see your opponent's comments is pretty next level
 LelouchVC2: LOL
 SamuelTheBad: Yeah, I mean the messages above the pacs. There's some interesting variety there
 Nerchio: i think something is wrong with compiles i timeout and there is no reason for tha
 thethiny: I was in the middle of fixing my code when I got promoted, now what I was working on is gone -_-
 PowerPixel: Nerchio: same
 thethiny: @Nerchio Max Heap is very small
 thethiny: 4 recursive calls and I timeout
 icecream17: When a Pac does MOVE and there are 2 shortest paths which path does the pacman take
 Nerchio: random
 thethiny: for me it was going back and forth in place lol
 icecream17: 5 people above the boss right now in wood2 lol
 Nerchio: =/
 Nerchio: thethiny what does it mean they changed something?
 thethiny: What do you mean?
 Nerchio: i mean i shouldn't be timing out
 Nerchio: so something is wrong
 thethiny: We're timing out because they also don't want us to have too many calls, it should execute fast.
 thethiny: So our solution shouldn't be recursion, but node-type solutions.
 Nerchio: recursions are fine if you can manage your time
 thethiny: I know but the time seems to be small
 Nerchio: 50ms
 thethiny: I tried to see where I time out
 thethiny: and I'm timing out only when I exceed Max Heap
 thethiny: what language are you coding in?
 Nerchio: java
 Nerchio: how do you know max heap size
 PowerPixel: i'm currently using Java and my code times out as well
 PowerPixel: sometimes
 BenjaminUrquhart: Runtime.getMXBean().somethingsomething
 Enknable: '/usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily unavailable'
 thethiny: I don't know the max heap size, but what I did is call a recursive function (with memory) 4 times and it times out
 thethiny: when I decreased the calls (if depth &gt; 2: return) the timeout is gone
 rcar: you've got 50ms per round and 768MB memory to work with
 PowerPixel: i don't use recursion anywhere tho, and it never times out when testing it against the IDE bot
 CanisLupus: same issue here '/usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily unavailable'
 solaimanope: can one pac do both move and switch at the same time?
 BenjaminUrquhart: wait nvm
 BenjaminUrquhart: Nerchio <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.management/java/lang/management/ManagementFactory.html#getRuntimeMXBean()">https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.management/java/lang/management/ManagementFactory.html#getRuntimeMXBean()</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: this has some useful methods
 Earthborne: &lt;rant&gt;gosh I hate that Python forces 'self'&lt;/rant&gt;
 thethiny: Don't use classes
 thethiny: :P
 BenjaminUrquhart: there's also some stuff in java.lang.Runtime
 Earthborne: Might think that's their intention when making it so frustrating
 BenjaminUrquhart: google it ig
 rcar: python has its flaws, but explicit self is definitely not one of them
 LelouchVC2: Im sitting here trying to code the distance formula then it takes me to the next league
 LelouchVC2: Like I was caught undressing
 Earthborne: No I actually appreciate it somewhat, and I tend to force myself to use "this" in Java even when it's not necessary
 Rafal.Py: my code was working 4 hours ago, but now it stopped...
 LelouchVC2: You're code has aged beyond reason
 Rafal.Py: I can't find where I screwed up
 LelouchVC2: Give it 4 extra hours and it'll obliterate the website
 Rafal.Py: I don't feel like laughing about it though
 Beerus: :laughing:
 Earthborne: But when I spend hours debugging just to find out I was missing a 'self', I need to hate it a bit
 rcar: hours of debugging to find a missing self is a PEBCAK problem
 Nerchio: so how do you print msg?
 wlesavo: hm, getting timeouts with error on first turn /usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily unavailable
 icecream17: grid.pegs? why did i name it that?
 Nerchio: wlesavo i have the same sometimes
 Earthborne: true :worried:
 icecream17: Is there a better name for "pellet" and "floor"?
 BenjaminUrquhart: um
 BenjaminUrquhart: dot
 BenjaminUrquhart: surface
 LelouchVC2: "food" and "walkway"
 Over9000: yummy and notwall
 struct: wlesavo report it on forum bug thread i guess
 LelouchVC2: "smoking" and "nonsmoking"
 thethiny: Now I am timing out as well @Nerchio
 Rafal.Py: wlesavo, just try again. It happens
 thethiny:  /usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily unavailable
 Earthborne: What, I had a game where I timed out, but when I sent the parameters to the IDE I won
 LelouchVC2: Implement your changes one at a time until the code breaks, then you'll see what you did wrong
 LelouchVC2: CG is supposed to make sense?
 wlesavo: struct there are some treads about this on the forum already, different games related 
 struct: yeah I see
 struct: but on thibaud aswered that they fixed it I think
 AaronHe7: if pac mans collide do they both die?
 angauber: no
 thethiny: I pressed Replay in same conditions and it worked, there's an issue with the server I bet.
 icecream17: Oof. I have an array for all the pellets I can see, but i
 icecream17: can't know if i ate it yet....
 moidda: Having trouble printing position for multilple pacs&#160;:/
 Over9000: I have reported the stdbuf error here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/180397/26?u=over9000">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/180397/26?u=over9000</a>
 moidda: One pac doesnt receive any command
 rcar: @moidda are you doing multiple commands separated by |
 Wei-1: after Scala 2.13, the initialization for Scala had become even longer... my Scala bot will time out even with the default code...

 LelouchVC2: what league are you guys in right now?
 angauber: the visual debugger is bugged x) the x pos of pacs have a +1 offset
 BoBot: lol I got /usr/bin/stdbuf: resource temporarily unavailable in one run...servers really are overloaded?
 SamuelTheBad: ...the default bot just timed out when I hit replay.
 BenjaminUrquhart: servers are broken
 PowerPixel: LelouchVC2: Wood 1 rank 42 bc i suck
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's all folks
 elderlybeginner: timed out error is annoying
 PowerPixel: Apparently, there's also issues with C
 cegprakash: how do I avoid zig zag&#160;:(&#160;:(&#160;:(
 gregballot: It's a bug right&#160;?
 gregballot: the timeout thing
 BoBot: the number of people participating is amazing though
 SamuelTheBad: Yeah. I've been going insane trying to fix this incredibly simple thing, 99% sure it's just the servers now
 gregballot: It happened to me, but I don't see how it can happen
 PowerPixel: gregballot: most probably
 Enknable: can you see how many?
 BenjaminUrquhart: PowerPixel <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458313287">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458313287</a>
 moidda: @rcar thanks. My bad didnt notice
 BenjaminUrquhart: you output "null" at some point and get killed
 Wei-1: ok, hearing so many people also timeout does make me happier
 Illedan: Yeah, they are looking into it
 Wei-1: cool cool
 PowerPixel: BenjaminUrquhartit's not me tho&#160;:^)
 BenjaminUrquhart: but that is you
 PowerPixel: i'm still Wood 1 what
 BenjaminUrquhart: I can play with the top 1000 players
 BenjaminUrquhart: since there's around 700 in bronze, I can play with the top 300 wood players
 PowerPixel: oh, i see
 PowerPixel: well i dunno how that can happen tbh
 solaimanope: Is there any tool to locally test the code?
 BenjaminUrquhart: your pac reached a dead end
 BenjaminUrquhart: solaimanope <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: not sure if anyone made the referee compatible yet though
 Counterbalance: code like ` pacmen.stream().filter(pac -&gt; !pac.isDead())..filter((value) -&gt; (value.getNumber() == pacNumber)).findFirst().get();`instead of player.alivePacmen.get(id) doesn't help server load either
 solaimanope: Thanks
 LelouchVC2: How the hell do you control more than 1 pac
 PowerPixel: you do
 Rafal.Py: for look?
 BenjaminUrquhart: command 1 | command 2 | command 3 etc...
 AlexRSS: Has anyone else gotten /usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily unavailable in the pacman challenge?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 BoBot: yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: known issue
 Counterbalance: yes
 PowerPixel: yes
 Rafal.Py: Yes try again
 LelouchVC2: Yea, but you only get coordinates for one?
 Over9000: yes
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's a known issue
 BenjaminUrquhart: I think the answer is yes
 Rafal.Py: LelouchVC2, you have a loop for i in range(visible_pac_count):
 Rafal.Py: you get all pacs in it
 Astrobytes: Possibly BenjaminUrquhart :D
 Rafal.Py: if mine:
 PowerPixel: the server seems to be unable to handle the laod, and tries to access stdbuf but fails because another program's already accessing it, just a wild guess tho, i'm not expert
 LelouchVC2: I see :o
 AlexRSS: Agh, is it a problem I've done or is it on CG's end and I just keep trying?
 LelouchVC2: Thanks, i see now
 Rafal.Py: k gl
 PowerPixel: the laod btw
 BenjaminUrquhart: my raking is dropping aaa
 PowerPixel: the load** smfh
 Astrobytes: AlexRSS CG issue
 solaimanope: I have seen that initially all empty spaces will have pellets. Will this remain during rest of the competition?
 AntiSquid:  /usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily unavailable AutomatonNN Automaton2000 fix it
 Automaton2000: i would like to know how it is done
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the problem with the same problem
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah yes the euler ping
 AntiSquid: i find the message itself more amuzing
 AntiSquid: seeing the problem with the same problem, how to do the contest inside the contest
 PowerPixel: recursion be like
 Nerchio: so you can't see around the corners yeah?
 BenjaminUrquhart: recursion be likerecursion be likerecursion be likerecursion be like
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 0x464d: Hello, can someone help mep?...I start with a lot of pellets score but almost at the end suddently the score CHANGE A LOT and finnaly i lose. I can't understand why? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/458319110">https://www.codingame.com/replay/458319110</a>
 PowerPixel: ah yes, buffer overflow
 Waffle3z: you timed out so you lost
 0x464d: But why time out??
 BenjaminUrquhart: crash or you took too long to provide output
 PowerPixel: does your code time out when you test in IDE&#160;?
 0x464d: what's mean that?
 BenjaminUrquhart: there's a time limit
 PowerPixel: timeout means your program didn't output anything before the time limit
 0x464d: 0x464d has not provided 1 lines in time 
 0x464d: that line?

 icecream17: yes
 elderlybeginner: nah, seems like a bug for me; have the same
 PowerPixel: which is 1s for the first turn and 50 ms for each others
 Uljahn: rip CG
 cegprakash: what is the visibility range?
 Uljahn: line of sight
 cegprakash: yeah what is that
 SamuelTheBad: also they have eyes in the back of their head
 cegprakash: is it like 3 or 4?
 Over9000: as far as you can see
 Over9000: infinite
 SamuelTheBad: A straight line until it hits a wall
 cegprakash: oh
 Over9000: but just horizontal/vertical 'til wall
 cegprakash: but for some reason I am able to see diagonal
 Over9000: Maybe there's another pac seeing that stuff?
 Over9000: Or it's a super-pellet?
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458324349">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458324349</a>
 Zenoscave: unforuntate
 Uljahn: what is line, Automaton2000?
 Over9000: Or maybe wa can see diagonal, I'm not actually sure
 Automaton2000: have you read the input
 AlexRSS: is there any way to run a line by line debug of my code in the CG editor?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 Astrobytes: No
 Zenoscave: AlexRSS only if you run the program locally with the inputs given
 Zenoscave: Which involves error printing the inputs given
 wlesavo: only 28 computing, huh
 Astrobytes: pewpew hi Zeno
 Zenoscave: pew pew Hey Astro
 AlexRSS: Seriously? How the hell is that not a feature
 Zenoscave: You're welcome to write your own coding websites with debugging added
 Astrobytes: Gotta think outside the box AlexRSS
 Zenoscave: Give it a try
 Uljahn: just use debug printing why even run line by line?
 Zenoscave: Uljahn tricky memory bugs
 Astrobytes: ^
 MadKnight: it would be a heavy task for the servers AlexRSS
 Uljahn: tricky == bad data structure design
 MadKnight: and the servers are already struggling running all the bots in release mode
 icecream17: Hey, i'm in wood. Does the typeId ever change?
 Counterbalance: yes
 Counterbalance: in bronze
 Zenoscave: probably in brinze
 AlexRSS: Alright, that's a fair enough answer. Still frustrating trying to figure out exactly where this is giving up without it
 Spookiel: Is anyone else having trouble with their Pac-men moving at the same speed as the bots?
 Zenoscave: Was correct
 Astrobytes: I always aim for brinze league
 Uljahn: easy brinzy
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 Zenoscave: that's the way to do it
 Nerchio: so you guys also have random timeouts or its just java
 Counterbalance: c++ too
 elderlybeginner: python3 too
 Counterbalance: ide and arena
 Nerchio: so annoying :D
 Astrobytes: Brinze-&gt;Solver-&gt;Guld-&gt;Lagend
 PowerPixel: and now the bot in IDE times out for me
 JBM: weed
 BenjaminUrquhart: Guld
 elderlybeginner: mostly second round timeouts thou
 Zenoscave: rip CG 
 AlexRSS: Yeah, timed out for me as well
 thethiny: It times out of the 2nd run approx
 AlexRSS: Refreshed and now it just gives me a red error saying "Only one executor allowed" if I try and run
 moidda: Does anyone know the constraints for width and height?
 cegprakash: moidda it's dynamic
 Counterbalance: MAP_MIN_WIDTH = 28, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/caaf2e8c-690b-4985-b311-d30103971774">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/caaf2e8c-690b-4985-b311-d30103971774</a>
 AlexRSS: I give up. As always I love the concept of stuff on here but the bloody environment being so unstable ruins it
 cegprakash: AlexRSS what problem are u facing
 moidda: Counterbalance where did you find such constrains
 Counterbalance: moidda in the referee
 AaronHe7: yeah run code breaks the game
 Astrobytes: AlexRSS wait til later if there are platform issues
 cegprakash: what language are u coding AlexRSS
 cegprakash: I don't get any issues Astrobytes

 Astrobytes: cegprakash some people are getting quite a few ceg, CG are working on it
 Counterbalance: the constraints weren't there before in the description 
 Enknable: first day jitters
 struct: Will probably be fixed tomorrow
 Enknable: it happens
 struct: I hope the score will also be fixed tomorrow&#160;:)
 struct: ah tomorrow is saturday _(
 Zenoscave: struct what's the score bug?
 struct:&#160;:(
 Counterbalance: today then
 Waffle3z: today is saturday
 cegprakash: AaronHe7 try printing logs on errorstream
 struct: score and opponent score is always 0
 Zenoscave: ...

 Enknable: hey Astrobytes! 
 Enknable: hows the pellet hunting?
 solaimanope: I am getting "/usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily"
 AaronHe7: No it just never runs
 AaronHe7: stuck on "play in progress"
 AntiSquid: no way to know if you killed someone or they ran off round the corner right?
 Astrobytes: Slow Enknable, I'm on strong painkillers so I'm coding like a moron :D
 Astrobytes: You?
 Counterbalance: Lulemair  new Date().getTime() gives you milliseconds
 Enknable: damn whats got ya in so much pain?
 icecream17: Oh no! I timeouted with: /usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily unavailable
 StuykSoft: This: /usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily unavailable
 StuykSoft: annoying asf
 Globy: Counterbalance, I saw on stackoverflow that it's not good to do this, kinda lack on precision and all&#160;:/ Is it the only way&#160;?
 Counterbalance: there's other ways, but I didn't get them to work
 icecream17: .getTime()?
 solaimanope: I am getting /usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily unavailable a lot
 icecream17: I just create a "time = new Date()"
 Astrobytes: Lower back issue, Enknable. Thankfully nothing too serious (had some tests) but gotta take painkillers for a bit. Not fun but I'll live!
 Zenoscave: Known issue solaimanope
 icecream17: And do "new Date() - time"
 solaimanope: Zenoscave is there a solution?
 Globy: Same problem. But looks like it's the only solution, so I will take it&#160;! Thanks&#160;!
 Counterbalance: Lulemair process.hrtime() didn't work at the time, maybe now it does (I bailed on using JS years ago because of garbage collector timeouts when the server load was high)
 Zenoscave: Wait solaimanope. Servers are overloaded
 Enknable: You never know, Astrobytes. Some painkiller eurekas could be coming your way&#160;:)
 Globy: Are timeouts an issue from codingGame btw&#160;?Sometimes I get this at the first round, and the program doesn't even get to the loopGame
 icecream17: not usually
 icecream17: that codingame video must've created too much hype
 solaimanope: Thanks Zenoscave. Does this problem occur in rated matches too?
 AntiSquid: 1600 first day icecream17, last contest there were hardly that many at the end of first week afaik
 Counterbalance: yes, unfortunately - so leaderboard is a bit unreliable atm
 Astrobytes: I highly doubt that one Enknable :DGiving myself 10 or so minutes before I crash out lol
 AntiSquid: k good night, prolly 3k by tomorrow when i wake up
 AntiSquid: ah it's already friday, nvm
 Astrobytes: gn Squidster
 PowerPixel: is it only me or the bot is broken&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Since the bot is yours it is most likely you
 PowerPixel: doesn't even tell me i didn't output anything in time

 moidda: Ok, I was improving my code and suddenly got promoted to Bronze
 Counterbalance: yeah that sucks
 Astrobytes: :DYou're outputting something bad perhaps? Which language PowerPixel?
 RubenFilipe: the servers are not doing so well
 YannT: several nodes are crapped out yeah, there's random crashes at the moment
 Astrobytes: Yes moidda, that happened for me from W2 to W1
 PowerPixel: Out of system resources rofl
 Astrobytes: It should all be fine later today/tomorrow
 YannT: and the shops are closed tomorrow so good luck getting more ressources
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Not here
 Astrobytes: VE day tomorrow right?
 PowerPixel: Astrobytes 
 Astrobytes: Probably a server issue if your code was working fine previously PowerPixel
 PowerPixel: ye, i could run my code just rn
 struct: Zenoscave the score bug was fixed
 YannT: Astrobytes: yes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: We don't even get a holiday in UK for that YannT!
 AaronHe7: is anybody writing in c++
 jthemphill: I think most people write C++ for these challenges, since you can usually turn compute power into better moves
 YannT: Astrobytes: weird! sounds like the kind of thing that would warrant one
 YannT: isn't it when you put on the poppies or am I confusing things?
 ZomBMage: Nah, that's rememberance sunday
 Astrobytes: That's Armistice Day, 11th November YannT
 ZomBMage: VE day is some stupid thing some stupid people in our country made up to boost morale
 YannT: ahh okay&#160;:) I just remebered that there was a thing in the UK with poppies, but not when it was&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: No ZomBMage VE day is celebrated across Europe
 ZomBMage: Oh is it a whole europe thing
 Astrobytes: Um yeah, VE = Victory in Europe
 ZomBMage: Ohhh yes
 Astrobytes: :D
 ZomBMage: I mean the way us brits seem to be doing it this year makes me want to curl up in a ball and cry
 Astrobytes: You know it man
 ZomBMage: i am not having a picnic on my doorstop thanks &gt;:(
 YannT: it's the day the nazis surrendered
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out now
 Astrobytes: Totally banjaxed

 KCrown: thanks McArcher
 TenYearOldCommitter_4b8d: yeah
 McArcher: no problem bb
 McArcher: now has any tested speed of list vs matrrix for this problem?
 Enknable: Edmonton!
 McArcher: ya bb
 Enknable: you're the first Edmontonian ive ever seen here lol
 TenYearOldCommitter_4b8d: So, is this "/usr/bin/stdbuf" error common?
 PowerPixel: yes it is 
 PowerPixel: for the moment that is
 thethiny: I found it dating back to Sep' 16
 thethiny: that's 2016
 TenYearOldCommitter_4b8d: Yeah, found that post but didn't know if it was mostly fixed or not
 icecream17: NOOO i did an infinite loop in the console =(
 TenYearOldCommitter_4b8d: ctrl-c?
 McArcher: haha
 PowerPixel: it's server load most probably
 solaimanope: Does having speedup mean non-speed-up bots will skip one turn?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 solaimanope: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/458351651">https://www.codingame.com/replay/458351651</a>Streams of turn 3 and 5 are not shown here. Do you know why?

 McArcher: yes they are
 icecream17: 1 frame = 1 action
 wlesavo: gn
 jthemphill: are height and width essentially constant?
 Nerchio: no
 icecream17: wow
 thethiny: to the guy who asked how can you see diagonal:
 thethiny: Super-pellets are so bright that they can be seen from everywhere!
 ZarthaxX: Nerchio nice profile pic
 ZarthaxX: and nice rank
 Nerchio: thanks

 ggjulio: Hi, i'm new on CG. Is A* pathfinding fast enough for 5 pacman&#160;? (I never done it before. Not sure if it the best algo to try...)
 Nerchio: you can get away with easier algos than A*
 Nerchio: but if you want feel free to do it :p

 RubenFilipe: JPS
 ggjulio: Nerchio Minimax&#160;?
 TrentT: Easier algos such as?
 RubenFilipe: although JPS probably isnt the best here
 Nerchio: for movement? bfs is fine
 RubenFilipe: I did bfs
 RubenFilipe: but probably something better would be in order
 ggjulio: Nerchio First time doing bot programming, so yes, problably my choices sucks :joy:
 Nerchio: I did a couple of challenges already and for movement bfs was decent for most of them
 Waffle3z: since you get a full second on the first turn you can probably precompute every shortest path
 Nerchio: in terms of grid
 RubenFilipe: yeah
 RubenFilipe: even if u cant, lighthouses ( i dont rememeber the name) with A* can do the trick
 jaroldeen: What is this error??? /usr/bin/stdbuf: Resource temporarily unavailable
 RubenFilipe: but I thinnk you are right, pre-compute them all
 Nerchio: you can do that yes
 VicHofs: what would be better than bfs in this case bro
 Nerchio: but you dont need to optimize before you actually reach timeout problems
 RubenFilipe: y, sure
 RubenFilipe: I don't really know what comes next as well
 Nerchio: especially if its someones first challenge
 Nerchio: then optimization before anything else is not recommended
 rcar: seriously. you can still be near the top right now with basic strategy and manhattan distance ignoring walls
 ggjulio: Okay, thx&#160;! Will try it, I want to learn it anyway.  
 rcar: save a* and bfs for later if you're still in wood
 Nerchio: bfs is bread and butter for challenges its not too hard also
 ggjulio: okay
 VicHofs: just to get some opinions, did you guys implement the map as a list, matrix or what?
 RubenFilipe: matrix
 BenjaminUrquhart: combination matrix and map
 jthemphill: my "battles in progress" is stuck at 0%, and my ranking on the leaderboard is stuck at wood 202 despite what looks like a 90% winrate. Is this happening to anyone else?
 Nerchio: the servers seem to have some problems
 jthemphill: :cold_sweat:
 icecream17: me too. think the server is struggling
 LelouchVC2: The server trying to hold the mass of the world
 icecream17: nevermind, it updated, i'm 8th
 jthemphill: oh okay yeah 24th now
 BenjaminUrquhart: the jvm doesn't have enough memory to start
 BenjaminUrquhart: reeeee
 Nerchio: yeah java is not doing so well today
 Nerchio: i hope it will be fixed when servers stabilize
 cooljoseph: Is there a way to use header files for c++?
 jthemphill: just copy/paste all the code, it's what #include does anyway
 cooljoseph: Yeah, I guess.  I just wanted it more organized
 jthemphill: i sometimes like to organize things on my local machine, then inline everything when i put on the website

 poInT: seems servers are ded&#160;:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 Illuminait: is that whats happening? keep getting timedout on my code running
 Illuminait: been looking forever trying to find the loop it was stuck in
 RubenFilipe: might be servers, might not be
 RubenFilipe: i get timeouts on server as well, and sometimes the error people are complaining about usr/bin/etc..

 LelouchVC2: You can kill your opponents and become #1
 icecream17: Phew! Finally, I will never ever timeout because I crash.
 BenjaminUrquhart: to be clear, we are not advocating the assassination of the 10k registered participants to get first place
 BenjaminUrquhart: I prefer a hard crash simply because they're easier to spot in replays
 VicHofs: of course not haha
 BenjaminUrquhart: :eyes:

 icecream17: oh no
 BenjaminUrquhart: 🔫
 BenjaminUrquhart: I totally didn't just find the unicode for it
 VicHofs: your loss they only have water guns
 LelouchVC2: LOL
 BenjaminUrquhart: *squirt*
 BenjaminUrquhart: :heart:
 VicHofs: ouch
 VicHofs: MY PC DUDE
 BenjaminUrquhart: AutomatonNN fix the servers
 icecream17: :no_mouth: Σ\\\\\\----&gt;
 AutomatonNN:  are you not doing the contest release&#160;?
 VicHofs: WHAT THE HECK
 icecream17: AutomationNN Automaton2000 who will respond faster
 Automaton2000: thats the way to go though
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's always gonna be 2000
 icecream17: it almost looks like the same account
 BenjaminUrquhart: nah
 icecream17: my biggest win ever: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/458382877">https://www.codingame.com/replay/458382877</a>
 VicHofs: yo what lmao
 VicHofs: how did Blinky time out
 LelouchVC2: Cause Blinky was busy checking out Pinky
 Enknable: bots aren't perfect, just ask Automaton2000
 jthemphill: I think anyone can time out right now because stdin is slow for everyone
 Automaton2000: but i was thinking about
 VicHofs: umm... are these NLP bots?
 Enknable: Automaton2000, you gonna let him say that about you?
 Automaton2000: so that i can get legend
 VicHofs: here's hoping Pinky's just as inconsistent
 sparky: automaton2000, perl or php?
 Automaton2000: is there a way to get the score
 VicHofs: why are the bots asking the questions here lmao
 TrentT: AutomatonNN Can you help Vichofs
 AutomatonNN: i noticed that the way i do it is a bit of a problem with that as it is
 VicHofs: Automation2000 can you help AutomationNN help me
 VicHofs: AutomatonNN can you help Automaton2000 help me help AutomatonNN
 Automaton2000: they mean the exact same thing
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the anti-bomb?
 VicHofs: damn you're good
 BenjaminUrquhart: icecream17 which leage
 BenjaminUrquhart: league*
 icecream17: wood2
 BenjaminUrquhart: get out of there sir
 VicHofs: BenjaminUrquhart wbu
 BenjaminUrquhart: bronze
 VicHofs: nice
 icecream17: alreadt 453 lines but my bot is bad =/
 NinjaDoggy: ._. 453 lines wood 2 bot
 VicHofs: dude you're overdoing it lol\
 LelouchVC2: Wtf?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have 487 lines
 VicHofs: You can get out of wood2 with no extra lines of code
 LelouchVC2: 453 lines? How'd you manage?
 icecream17: Check it out:

 struct: icecream17 you want ban?
 NinjaDoggy: lol struct
 LelouchVC2: Idk why you're using dynamic memory
 NinjaDoggy: leave the poor wood 2 man alone&#160;:(
 icecream17: oh I didn't fit all the code. oh well
 BenjaminUrquhart: don't share code
 LelouchVC2: My bots are doing pretty good
 icecream17: ok
 LelouchVC2: Share code
 struct: NinjaDoggy just go to closest pettel
 struct: Game will change a lot on bronze
 struct: It also works for wood 1
 VicHofs: I mean dude shared wood2 no one really minds probably lol
 NinjaDoggy: D: pettel = animal home D:
 Illuminait: 450+ lines of code, and servers acting up, just a coincidence surely
 LelouchVC2: LOL
 NinjaDoggy: yes more lines of code = wharder on server&#160;:)
 VicHofs: BenjaminUrquhart wth seriously
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 struct: yes
 VicHofs: I did it too and got to wood1
 NinjaDoggy: lame -_-
 struct: im around 370  with move to closest
 VicHofs: now I'm tryna implement BFS to see if I get a boost
 NinjaDoggy: not gonna submit till I have BFS precompute + minimax done :D
 struct: NinjaDoggy dont forget
 struct: there will be fog of war
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: ahh yeathat sucks
 NinjaDoggy: but at least my BFS can be used right
 BenjaminUrquhart: not really a fog persay
 NinjaDoggy: cuz map is known
 VicHofs: what is this fog of war tho
 struct: not a fog?
 VicHofs: how's it gonna get implemented
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=43832388706627">https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=43832388706627</a>
 struct: Like this
 NinjaDoggy: wait it's
 NinjaDoggy: line of sight?
 struct: yes
 NinjaDoggy: ahhh tyty
 NinjaDoggy: nice to keep in mind
 VicHofs: is that different from what we have now tho?
 struct: on wood 1
 struct: you can see all pellets
 VicHofs: oh
 VicHofs: didn't knwo that
 NinjaDoggy: what about pac mans
 VicHofs: what about wood2
 struct: also the big pellet is always visible
 NinjaDoggy: do you only sees ones in line of sight?
 struct: same for pacmans
 struct: So only big pettels are not affected
 NinjaDoggy: ok no biggies just gotta change eval function then :D
 VicHofs: the big ones can be seen from wherever?
 struct: yes
 VicHofs: damn ok
 struct: board max is 33 so doesnt fit in int32
 NinjaDoggy: wowwww
 struct: vertical is 17 so it doesnt fit in int16
 struct: is this on purpouse???
 NinjaDoggy: how could they T_T
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's varying sizes
 struct: This must be on purpouse :p
 NinjaDoggy: it's k
 NinjaDoggy: just store it in 9 64-bit numbers
 VicHofs: idk if they'd go that far
 Waffle3z: you can probably special case the edges. top and bottom are always solid
 struct: 0 and height you mean?
 Waffle3z: 0 and height-1 yeah
 Waffle3z: they're all walls
 LelouchVC2: I need ur mother to call me, it's urgent
 NinjaDoggy: is it also guarenteed that it's a maze so like no 2 wide?
 BenjaminUrquhart: ye
 NinjaDoggy: ok so...
 Waffle3z: mazes don't have cycles and these do but yeah there are no open squares
 Waffle3z: there can be squares that are walls
 NinjaDoggy: max number of columns is really just 16?
 NinjaDoggy: or is it 17 D:
 LelouchVC2: Honestly, idk why you'd need the map
 Waffle3z: if the max height is 17 then the max number of rows that aren't walls is 15
 NinjaDoggy: it's 8 actually right?
 NinjaDoggy: cuz u can't have 2 wide
 NinjaDoggy: 2 height chunks
 Waffle3z: 14 I guess since it's always odd
 Waffle3z: I mean 15
 Waffle3z: is it always odd? that might not be guaranteed
 NinjaDoggy: honestly though...
 NinjaDoggy: who cares :P
 LelouchVC2: Can you catch something like "is blocked from entering"?
 VicHofs: NinjaDoggy do u main Genji
 thethiny: Guys how do we move up the Rankings exactly?
 LelouchVC2: having a sexy bott
 VicHofs: Submit your code and beat the bot
 NinjaDoggy: VicHofs lol I used a few years ago XD
 VicHofs: NinjaDoggy awww why'd u quit bro
 VicHofs: I main that mf
 thethiny: There's no "bot", it's just someone who's #1 and I keep winning but I don't see my Ranking change
 VicHofs: Yeah there is
 NinjaDoggy: cuz every hero blizzard released made genji's life worse XD
 thethiny: Mada Mada
 VicHofs: what language are you coding in? thethiny
 thethiny: Python
 VicHofs: HOLY CRAP GENJI MAIN REUNION
 VicHofs: thetiny bot's name is Blinky
 thethiny: I need healing
 thethiny: I'm in Bronze, not in Wood
 VicHofs: oh.
 VicHofs: well silver hasn't unlocked yet
 VicHofs: it's only on the 11th
 thethiny: But at least I should increase in rating, right?
 VicHofs: ranking yes
 VicHofs: why?
 thethiny: which isn't happening
 VicHofs: huh
 VicHofs: idk then
 thethiny: I'm stuck on 291 even though I have a 10 win streak
 VicHofs: let's ask the bots
 Durkin: beating more people in total than another bot will place you ahead of them in the ranking. Beating a person wont necessarily make you higher than them
 VicHofs: Automaton2000 yo help out my boy thethiny
 Automaton2000: it's not like there's a lot of stuff
 thethiny: Makes sense, thanks Drukin
 VicHofs: see he's useless
 thethiny: lol yeah
 Waffle3z: I don't think the ranks update after every game
 thethiny: Like Mercy Mains when there's a Pharah
 AFrenchGuy: I would say that the better your bot, the longer your games, so you might expect a little delay when you get to higher grades
 VicHofs: :heart: thethiny
 Waffle3z: your submission isn't in progress anyway though
 VicHofs: what'd u guys implement to get to bronze?
 VicHofs: some guys said they got there with just nearest pellet lol
 Waffle3z: go down the path with the highest value
 VicHofs: but I'm still working on BFS to get there.
 AFrenchGuy: That is greedy algorithm
 AFrenchGuy: that won't last
 VicHofs: yeah I'm not trying to do that
 Heaty: Yo! I just joined. Hows it going everyone!
 Waffle3z: it's a start
 PeaceMoreZ: Hey
 VicHofs: but I did get past wood2 like thta
 PeaceMoreZ: how's it going with you
 Heaty: Needed a distraction from work so here I am.I was going through the site and saw y'all chattin so yea, had to drop in.
 Heaty: Happy coding! Cheers
 TrentT: Automaton2000 Say hello to Heaty
 Automaton2000: so you would have to read the rules :d
 Heaty: Yes, I am going through that now.
 VicHofs: Automaton2000 tell AutomatonNN to tell Automaton2000 to tell everyone good luck
 Automaton2000: do u use instead&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: what do you think about the contest?
 TrentT: Automaton2000 is a mod that can answer any questions you have
 BenjaminUrquhart: woah a coherent response
 Automaton2000: anyone can help with a puzzle?
 VicHofs: can you help me Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: let's say you have a working sim
 VicHofs: ok, then what? Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: well it is the end of the day
 VicHofs: ...yes?
 Heaty: Automation2000 is just adorable
 Waffle3z: Automaton2000 is hard to spell
 Automaton2000: so it could be a bit confusing
 VicHofs: hey AutomatonNN can you write my code for me I'm tired
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the replay in the code golf code
 MathieuLapointe: we had starter pack before any one know where they were&#160;???
 VicHofs: why do they resemble players more than actual players
 VicHofs: players are more helpful tho
 DeWill: hehe...
 Heaty: Hahaha! I just misspelled Automaton2000. Oops!
 Automaton2000: and it did not work
 Heaty: Hahahaha!! That is just adorable!
 icecream17: Automaton2000 who are you
 Automaton2000: u need to get to top 100
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 fvla: this is trash, this Emacs mode...
 struct: you can change it
 fvla: I just discovered that there's a way to replicate Emacs commands, but I can't even do ctrl-n (down/next line) without opening a new window
 LelouchVC2: It's suuch a bother to get these retarded bots to not bump into eachother infinitely
 fvla: There's Vim too, but there's no way I'm stepping within 10 meters of that
 icecream17: i wish my floodfills dont always timeout. how do people do it automaton2000?
 BenjaminUrquhart: LelouchVC2 there's a simple solution once you reach bronze :P
 Automaton2000: that would be nice to talk to people who are at the top of the leaderboard
 LelouchVC2: BenjaminUrquhart really? So I shouldn't bother to fix it now?
 VicHofs: Automaton2000 please stop
 Automaton2000: if you have enough time to do all this
 fvla: wait until bronze
 BenjaminUrquhart: well you should bother
 fvla: you have a lot more options then
 LelouchVC2: That's the only thing making me lose some of these rounds, my bots start humping eachother
 fvla: imo, you should build up complex behavior like that when you have all the rules
 Heaty: Automaton2000, where is automatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: i dont know what it is this time
 Automaton2000: i think i might need to change my code to get the validators
 fvla: please don't remind me of Code MENT
 LelouchVC2: Don't remind ME of code ment
 fvla: "humping each other"
 LelouchVC2: *rolls eyes*
 toby666999: hello,everyone!
 icecream17: every time i try to floodfill it times out. i guess im stuck in wood again. sigh
 fvla: Floodfill?
 icecream17: closest pellet
 Nanosplitter: You don't really need anything complicated to get into bronze
 fvla: just BFS better
 fvla: as in, look up an algorithm
 LelouchVC2: how many 1st place battles do i need to get into bronze ffs
 fvla: and copy/paste and adapt it
 BenjaminUrquhart: enough
 fvla: patience, lelouch
 LelouchVC2: Patience is a virtue
 fvla: it takes a stupid amount of time to run it all, just go grab a drink or someting
 LelouchVC2: Which I do not possess
 fvla: pro tip
 LelouchVC2: Alright &lt;3
 LelouchVC2: Thanks&#160;:))
 fvla: play a game, watch something, anything but waiting lol
 LelouchVC2: I luv these infinite loop bumps, gonna grab some food
 Nanosplitter: I got into bronze using just a cartesian distance formula to find the closest pellet, it's not the most efficient but it's more than enough to beat the boss
 BenjaminUrquhart: I flooded
 BenjaminUrquhart: kappa
 fvla: seriously, you don't flood fill or cartesian distance; you BFS
 VicHofs: I'm trying to implement BFS too but it's my first time doing it
 fvla: which language?
 Nanosplitter: That is most efficient, yes
 fvla: whatever you say, my answer is google
 VicHofs: Python
 fvla: easily googlable
 Nanosplitter: But it gets much more complex when you don't have the whole board at your disposal
 fvla: and then adapt it to grid
 fvla: ofc
 VicHofs: Yeah I am doing that
 fvla: but i would argue that it's not actually that much more complex if you know what you're doing
 Nanosplitter: But getting from wood to bronze is super easy with using cartesian distance
 fvla: that's really sad, to be honest
 Nanosplitter: And also the vision your pac has in bronze is only straight lines so cartesian distance for that works well too
 Edrevan: why sad&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: wai you dont get the grid later?
 NinjaDoggy: ._.
 Nanosplitter: You do get the grid
 Nanosplitter: But not the pellets
 NinjaDoggy: bnut if you have grid you can bfs it
 fvla: cartesian distance in some edge cases will make it so your bot will go in some stupid directions with no pellets
 Nanosplitter: Yes, but still plenty good enough to get to bronze
 fvla: who cares about getting to bronze
 fvla: the real battle starts here!
 VicHofs: fvla let him do his thing we do BFS
 fvla: lolmao
 Waffle3z: the real battle starts at bronze where you have the full rules
 struct: some people just want to get full rules before starting to code
 Durkin: what? the whole point is getting to bronze right now, get the rest of the rull set
 fvla: he is at bronze lol
 fvla: in that context, you don't care about what you did to get to bronze
 Edrevan: fvla you gotta start somewhere. Not everybody has the skills / time / intuition required to do high level algorithms immediately
 struct: yeah
 struct: I do not
 fvla: yeah, you're right
 fvla: sorry
 Edrevan: in most contest many people don't even make it out of bronze ^^
 VicHofs: I don't either but I'm tryna get BFS down first
 fvla: BEE EFF ESSSSSSSSSSSSS
 Edrevan: there's actually a guy that gets into top gold / legend in most contests while only coding like 4 or 5 hours for the whole thing
 Edrevan: no fancy algorithms&#160;: just clever heuristics
 Edrevan: to each his own ^^
 Edrevan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/lazy-keep-simple/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/lazy-keep-simple/</a>
 fvla: BFS isn't what I'd call fancy, honestly
 fvla: there are some really cool things you can do with heuristics though
 NinjaDoggy: which genius came up with the idea of using a space to represent empty space&#160;:(
 icecream17: argh, im too tired and bfs seems too complicated. i'm gonna try to find something else
 thethiny: Make a copy of the board and modify it the way you wish, you don't have to stick to their standard
 thethiny: @icecream17
 thethiny: def bfs(grid, start): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d5777826-511c-4c4d-9c0b-5de2258564e4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d5777826-511c-4c4d-9c0b-5de2258564e4</a>
 Nanosplitter: or math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
 thethiny: yup lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: I've gotten every single variant of an out of memory error today
 BenjaminUrquhart: eee
 thethiny: lmao
 BenjaminUrquhart: the stdbuf thing
 BenjaminUrquhart: a full on OutOfMemoryError being thrown
 BenjaminUrquhart: and now
 BenjaminUrquhart: Error occurred during initialization of VMCannot create VM thread. Out of system resources.
 icecream17: what does path and queue mean?
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 NinjaDoggy: at the memory error thing
 NinjaDoggy: not the question ._.
 struct: Nanosplitter i think you have wrong type of distance
 NinjaDoggy: queue is a datastructure that lets you add stuff to the end and remove from the front
 NinjaDoggy: and the path is the sequence of grids 
 struct: should be abs(x2 - x1) + abs(y2 - y1)
 thethiny: **2 = abs
 thethiny: math.sqrt( x ** 2) is abs
 Nanosplitter: Yes
 struct: this is not the same
 struct:  math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
 struct: as what I pasted
 thethiny: it is the same
 thethiny: abs(-3) = 3
 icecream17: i only know js so only array, which is like "list" in python. and yes, i could check each pellet and take the distance, but i've already tried...
 thethiny: math.sqrt(3**2) = math.sqrt(9) = 3
 orlp: (1j**2)**0.5 == 1j

 orlp:&#160;:^)
 thethiny: x**0.5 = 1/x
 orlp: eh no
 thethiny: damn im bad at these
 thethiny: what is it then
 orlp: x ** 0.5 == math.sqrt
 struct: 3-1 = 2 + 3 - 1 = 2 == 42**2 + 2**2 = 8
 orlp: x ** -1 = 1/x
 struct: sqrt(8) is not 4
 thethiny: okay&#160;:^)
 Nanosplitter: I'm just using the distance formula, what's wrong with that?
 thethiny: @struct 
 struct: manhattan distance
 rcar: you're using euclidean distance and this is manhattan distance
 icecream17: i thought it was euclidean
 orlp: if you can only move up/down/left/right
 orlp: it's manhattan
 orlp: abs(y2 - y1) + abs(x2 - x1)
 orlp: also known as L1 distance
 icecream17: but the grid is a torus, bc pacman
 orlp: sure, but that's left as an exercise of the reader&#160;:)
 orlp: for*
 Nanosplitter: Ohhhh that makes sense
 icecream17: i should probably restart. ugh.
 icecream17: gn
 GeekNbOne: What  does the battle in progress pct mean?
 MathieuLapointe: c++ easiest way to translate the string to grid&#160;?
 MathieuLapointe: we had exemple that i no more find
 struct: you can do a for loop and check each char in the row
 MathieuLapointe: ok thank you long time did not coded
 NinjaDoggy: is there a way to get what's given to stdin?
 struct: This is what I do in STC MathieuLapointe
 rcar: other than reading from stdin?
 struct: its similar to read

 Javatacos: anyone else getting "Error occurred during initialization of VM" all the time?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 Javatacos: just too many people on?
 thethiny: @Mathieu in C++ a string is an array so by default it's a 2D array, just assume it's that and move on
 thethiny: it becomes grid[y][x]
 thethiny: not grid[x][y]
 MathieuLapointe: haha so many answers strugling to read them all thank you all
 orlp: is there a maximum width/height known?
 orlp: like, as in a constant
 struct: 33 17
 orlp: will it always stay that size?
 orlp: it doesn't say it in the problem as far as i can see
 struct: its in the referee
 orlp: where do I see that?
 struct: unless they change the referee those are the max
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/</a>
 orlp: ohhh we can run this challenge locally?
 orlp: I might implement DQN then
 BenjaminUrquhart: how many matches do I have to have in order to get a leaderboard rank
 BenjaminUrquhart: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 RubenFilipe: Do PPO, there it is adversarial in the bigger leagues I think
 orlp: are we allowed to share code from the referee?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: referee is public anyway
 jthemphill: I think the server isn't updating league rankings properly
 orlp: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/spring2020/Grid.java#L102">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/spring2020/Grid.java#L102</a>
 orlp: for those struggling with getting toroidal manhattan distance right
 orlp: although this assumes that only the x direction wraps
 MathieuLapointe: @orlp ho good point pacman warp to other side
 orlp: but since the challenge itself specifies that...
 orlp: or well, the referee
 jthemphill: I wish the system would check your solution against the boss a hundred or so times and short-circuit you out of the league if your bot clearly beats the boss
 Durkin: eh, problem with hardcoding to beat a boss flaw, 'specially if someone found an issue and mass-posted it
 BenjaminUrquhart: 70 matches now
 BenjaminUrquhart: no ranking
 BenjaminUrquhart: aaaa
 thethiny: Same here, been since 2 hours so far
 thethiny: no ranking
 jthemphill: i feel like the current system would already push you out of a league if you exploit a boss's flaw
 Durkin: think the current rankings is a ratio of your matches won over total compared to other players. Might do it if the boss is poor overall, but still relies on being better compared to the boss at beating everyone else than specificly beating the boss
 jthemphill: i guess... i don't particularly care about the competitive integrity of lower leagues? I just want to play with the rock paper scissors mechanic, and right now that mechanic is gated behind ranking computation shenanigans
 Durkin: god yeah, looking forwards to that, looks so goofy and I'm ready to have my ass kicked /o/
 MathieuLapointe: just googled flood fill toroidale went wrong 
 RubenFilipe: there aren't vertical wraps around the field right?
 struct: only horizontal
 JRiedl: nope, only horizontal
 RubenFilipe: thanks guys
 BenjaminUrquhart: doesn't stop me from handling vertical swaps anyway
 elderlybeginner: servers lagging?
 MathieuLapointe: #BenjaminUrquhart why ^
 BenjaminUrquhart: very
 solaimanope: ranklist is not being updated for more than 1 hour
 RubenFilipe: I think the referee doesn't handle vertical wraps
 RubenFilipe: how many people, when debugging, start looking at the Boss, and go crazy thinking they have weird bugs?
 jthemphill: every time
 RubenFilipe: thanks, I feel better now
 berries: this is a really dumb question but im new to some of this but how is the grid set up, is it just one long string callled row or is row an array to show the grid
 berries: because how the grid is initialized confuses me a bit
 NinjaDoggy: nothing is done for you
 NinjaDoggy: you just read input
 NinjaDoggy: and format it the way you like
 NinjaDoggy: input format is at the bottome
 NinjaDoggy: "game input"
 jthemphill: the row is a single line, but it's in a loop
 jthemphill: so you're looping through one string per row of the grid, from top to bottom
 JamesMarkus: Can anybody help me out with this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/for-loop-doesnt-run-enough-java/180745">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/for-loop-doesnt-run-enough-java/180745</a>
 berries: does row get replaced or is it concatenated on
 jthemphill: row is replaced
 NinjaDoggy: JamesMarkus the reason why it "stops running"
 NinjaDoggy: is because when you do System.ou
 jthemphill: @berries you can print row to stderr, it's just a string
 NinjaDoggy: codingame's gonna catch it and use it as your turn output
 NinjaDoggy: so yea use System.err.println() instead
 JamesMarkus: ah thank you
 berries: okay thanks
 ggjulio: Sometime, I lose with a timeout. But each time I load it in the ide, There is no timeout.
 BenjaminUrquhart: server is struggling
 ggjulio: Okay, does it count&#160;?
 ggjulio: In the leaderboard
 JamesMarkus: I changed it to System.err.print and it still only runs the loop twice
 Oioi: There is a server problem right now. My working code 6h ago is not working any longer
 berries: im just getting a vm thread error 
 VicHofs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458418021">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458418021</a> turns out Pinky times out too
 JamesMarkus: Yeah, I was thinking that might be the case. Sometimes I get an OutOfMemory error, sometimes I don't
 MathieuLapointe: how do i send cin to my class in c++ syntax question i guess but i dont find ...
 thethiny: what's your question exactly?
 berries: maybe ill just take a look at it again tomorrow lol
 jthemphill: @MathieuLapointe the starter code handles parsing from cin/stdin already
 thethiny: I lost to HKit by 1 point&#160;:(
 jthemphill: womp
 LelouchVC2: I had a draw because both our bots crashed at startup
 thethiny: lmao
 a_bar: Hello, can someone give me a hint on how to output in the format MOVE 0,18 9|MOVE 1 21 2. I'm trying to use lists to store my move but I get my result in '[ ]' which is not acceptable
 BenjaminUrquhart: python?
 a_bar: yes
 VicHofs: try f-strings a_bar
 BenjaminUrquhart: print(*moves, sep = "|")
 BenjaminUrquhart: make sure there are no bars in your commands
 BenjaminUrquhart: and that should work
 BenjaminUrquhart: don't ask me how it performs idk
 VicHofs: my bot's actually doing pretty good as is but I really wanna get this BFS going before bronze lol
 eulerscheZahl:  Console.WriteLine(string.Join("|", actions));
 BenjaminUrquhart: System.out.println(String.join("|", commands));
 VicHofs: what
 a_bar: Now I'm getting the output like MOVE|5|1|1|MOVE|7|1|1|. 
 BenjaminUrquhart: imagine using BFSthis post made by someone who uses BFS
 BenjaminUrquhart: er
 BenjaminUrquhart: a_bar how do you create the list
 a_bar: move+=["MOVE", x,y,value]
 a_bar: it makees sense why my output is like that
 JamesMarkus: My code works on an online compiler (obviously with some tweaks), but I can't get it to work here. Any help?
 BenjaminUrquhart: move.append([...])

 BenjaminUrquhart: as for the output
 MSmits: yay i converted my 500 line bot to c++. Now I can sleep.
 MSmits: by the way good morning eulerscheZahl
 BenjaminUrquhart: print(*map(" ".join, moves), sep = "|")
 BenjaminUrquhart: don't hurt me
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm not a pro python dev
 a_bar: light years ahead of me anyway
 LelouchVC2: What language was it originally MSits?
 MSmits: C#
 VicHofs: did you convert it manually
 MSmits: yes
 LelouchVC2: I love C#&#160;! Why'd you need to convert?
 ZarthaxX: smito
 VicHofs: you absolute madman lmao
 MSmits: I dunno, I suspect I will be searching at some point
 VicHofs: is there any way to change every instance in the onlline IDE?
 VicHofs: *online
 BenjaminUrquhart: search and replace?
 MSmits: actually, I just couldn't sleep... common contest problem and c++ conversion was on my list. Couldn't think very clearly, so the conversion was low hanging fruit. It's pretty brainless stuff
 LelouchVC2: Copy the code onto an IDe
 dbdr: did you stay up all night MSmits? :D
 VicHofs: yeah every instance BenjaminUrquhart
 LelouchVC2: and then copy it back when ur done
 MSmits: i honestly tried to sleep dbdr
 BenjaminUrquhart: ctrl/cmd + f
 VicHofs: LelouchVC2 that's the whole point of the question tho lmao
 MSmits: could not, too hyped
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: it's a nice state to be in too, right?
 BenjaminUrquhart: press the leftmost arrow to drop down a replace text box
 LelouchVC2: XD If your browser doesn't support replacing keywords then no choice
 BenjaminUrquhart: it supports regex too last I checked
 LelouchVC2: Damn, really?
 BenjaminUrquhart: CG has its own search and replace
 VicHofs: oh thanks BenjaminUrquhart
 MSmits: it's not bad, got most of my work done dbdr, will catch some sleep in the afternoon
 VicHofs: didn't know it had that along with searcg
 VicHofs: *search
 VicHofs: pretty handy
 dbdr: you can try aphasic sleep
 MSmits: I have an AI class at 9:00 (in 3 hrs), but I already did every assignment, so it's just mandatory presence
 Huday.object: lmao
 MSmits: I'll sleep on zoom :P
 LelouchVC2: Sleep in my arms&#160;:))
 Waffle3z: play a loop of yourself staring near the screen
 eulerscheZahl: does everyone get random timeouts in turn 1?
 LelouchVC2: Yes, not particularly turn 1
 Waffle3z: it's always only been turn 1 for me
 twray2: i have, yes
 VicHofs: just put a cool background and sleep no one's gonna bat an eye
 LelouchVC2: But everyone is getting the time outs
 MSmits: you missed the server problems eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: with your normal sleeping schedule
 VicHofs: I'm getting them too
 eulerscheZahl: thanks, then i won't investigate on my code
 MSmits: you normal person, you
 BenjaminUrquhart: server problems are still here
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458423361">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/458423361</a>i lost to the squid even
 BenjaminUrquhart: it takes an hour to get a leaderboard ranking after a submit
 dbdr: it's not fast now either
 dbdr: strange, with 29 computing on the challenge
 MSmits: no it's the old bug
 MSmits: we had it before
 BenjaminUrquhart: eulerscheZahl k found code problem for you
 BenjaminUrquhart: Bad command: Invalid Input: Expected MOVE &lt;id&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; or SPEED &lt;id&gt; or SWITCH &lt;id&gt; &lt;type(ROCK|PAPER|SCISSORS)&gt; but got 'MOVE 4'
 MSmits: where it times out randomly before the game starts
 MSmits: resource something
 dbdr: yes, I saw a compiler error
 eulerscheZahl: BenjaminUrquhart that's my old bot which i just fixed

 LelouchVC2: anyone see BBC
 DeWill: nope
 WINWINWIN: Given this line of code
 WINWINWIN: xt = (1−t) * other.x + t * self.x
 WINWINWIN: What does this error mean?

 Imsure1200q: euler is it possible to skip a turn lol
 Imsure1200q: in space maze
 iduel: guy's i need help what is i wrote 1+1 in python but how can i print it?
 iduel: i mean i wrote print(1+1) but it printed 2 so i only need it to print(1+1)
 WINWINWIN: iduel print('1 + 1')
 Imsure1200q: has anyone solves testcase 15 in space maze
 Imsure1200q: *solved
 Uljahn: "77 have started, 4 have finished" lol
 Uljahn: approved by two unnamed 20lvl accs :expressionless:
 Imsure1200q: nevermind i solved it&#160;:)
 Heliferepo: This moment when you get&#160;:

 [CG]Thibaud: empty space at the end&#160;?
 Imsure1200q: what
 Heliferepo: I tried to add one and removed one but yea xD
 Heliferepo: Btw Thibaud can I email you about a tournament project I have in mind for Clash Of Code?
 Heliferepo: A private event I think we need to email the staff
 Heliferepo: If I remember well
 [CG]Thibaud: of course!
 [CG]Thibaud: thibaud@codingame.com
 Heliferepo: ( It's about making a tournament with the epitech online coding club ) I am gonna send you the message right now
 Heliferepo: Should I write to you in French or english&#160;?
 [CG]Thibaud: whichever is easier for you

 WINWINWIN: Given this line of codext = (1−t) * other.x + t * self.xWhat does this error mean?

 Imsure1200q: is eulersche sleeping
 Uljahn: WINWINWIN: the problem is elsewhere, check for unclosed bracket
 tomatoes: wrong minus it seems
 cegprakash: bracket in python?
 WINWINWIN: But would that not be an unexpected EOF or something like that?
 Heliferepo: Not a bracket
 Uljahn: ah yes, minus is not minus
 Heliferepo: I think that is just a syntax error
 WINWINWIN: thanks, copy pasted that line from math.stackexchange, it should be the error
 Uljahn: xt = (1-t) * other.x + t * self.x
 cegprakash: omg hyphen instead of minus
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Heliferepo: the hyphen
 cegprakash: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Heliferepo: There is a difference right&#160;? Or does the compiler says hyphen and minus same
 Heliferepo: are the same*
 Imsure1200q: no i think they have a different ASCII
 Imsure1200q: like when ms word replaces your minuses with a "long minus" thats a hyphen
 Heliferepo: I just thought about something
 Heliferepo: That would really funny to do a coding challenge in asm
 Heliferepo: x)
 Imsure1200q: wats asm
 Heliferepo: Assembly language
 Imsure1200q: hahaha
 <b>**Imsure1200q&#160;: no</b>
 Heliferepo: The language used before C
 Heliferepo: x)
 Heliferepo: It's even possible (partially) by using C
 Imsure1200q: how about programming in moo
 Heliferepo: &gt; no

 Imsure1200q: wa
 Imsure1200q: moo is very good language
 Imsure1200q: imagine the left side of your laptop is broken
 Imsure1200q: all you need to code is m, o, right shift, and the right half of ur space bar
 Imsure1200q: boom
 Uljahn: just a brainf*ck variant
 Heliferepo: x)
 Imsure1200q: when is euler online
 Imsure1200q:  i neeed to testcase17
 Tiramon: it's worktime in germany, so i guess he will be here when he has some time in between or in a few hours when he finished working
 Imsure1200q: hes german?
 Tiramon: last time i checked .. yes&#160;;)
 Imsure1200q: so his name is euler or eulersche
 Imsure1200q: pretty sure the zahl is a last name
 Xcalibre: eulerscheZahl means Euler's Number
 Tiramon: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)</a>
 Imsure1200q: whats the sche
 Imsure1200q: like a suffix or smth
 Imsure1200q: oh well ill wait until 11:00 AM so dat i can ask him about it
 Imsure1200q: ahh everytime i ask for eulers help i end up making the solution and asking for help was pointless lol
 jacek: rubber toad debugging?
 Imsure1200q: wot
 Imsure1200q: idk kinda 
 DaNinja: Testcase 17 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/470619633">https://www.codingame.com/replay/470619633</a>
 Astrobytes: Nice DaNinja
 Imsure1200q: but i alredy solved it a while ago lol
 Astrobytes: You have submitted Imsure1200q?
 Imsure1200q: thnx anyway copying link
 Imsure1200q: nno i solved the testcase 17
 Imsure1200q: also it isnt so hard cuz you can divide cases into phases
 DaNinja: when I fix one remaining testcase, a different one breaks&#160;:(
 Imsure1200q: then fix that one without erasing the fix you did earlier
 DaNinja: if I could figure out how...
 Imsure1200q: but dividing into stages is really nice because you can focus on a specific move set
 Imsure1200q: instead of guessing from every single path
 Imsure1200q: but i still need EuLer
 DaNinja: try to Submit to see if it works on the validators too
 Imsure1200q: i havent started making the algorithm yet
 Imsure1200q: im just studying every case but i have smth in mind
 Imsure1200q: so my solutions very conststent (except CirCLiNg
 Imsure1200q: so thats why
 Imsure1200q: I need EuLERR
 Imsure1200q: but also testcase  17
 Imsure1200q: is it possible to edit your code and resubmit aafter submitting
 Astrobytes: Yes
 Tiramon: why do you need euler Imsure1200q? what is your problem?
 Astrobytes: Hey Tiramon, how's your Oware coming along?
 Tiramon: no training or improvement on my NN over the weekend, just finishing my 1/3 project at udacity and alot of distraction
 Astrobytes: Ah OK then
 Tiramon: hm but if i remember right i should have a some weights of last training that i didn't submit yet ...
 Imsure1200q: cuz sometimes im like raging over a testcase thinking its impossible (though i know it is possible) and i dont want to waste any time in the challenge so i wanted to see his solutions (or any other person's solution)
 Tiramon: what are you currently trying to solve?
 Imsure1200q: circling and testcases 19 - 30
 Imsure1200q: im still revising 18
 Astrobytes: (Space Maze)
 Tiramon: we got puzzles with 30 testcases?
 Imsure1200q: ye
 struct: Wont be easy to create a viewer  :/
 Astrobytes: For Shobu struct? What's the issue?
 struct: I need to check stones range I guess
 Tiramon: no, weights still run in the same problemts with webquinty and boss
 Astrobytes: You eliminated the invalid moves fully?
 Tiramon: most
 Tiramon: currently at &lt;= 1% during training
 Astrobytes: That's quite the improvement compared to previously. What was it, ~17%?
 Tiramon: around 15%
 Astrobytes: Damn tildes look like hyphens in this chat
 Astrobytes: Right
 Tiramon: it's kind of fund if i give him the command to explore some random move i can see how hight the explore rate is, because invalid move rate is almost identical&#160;;)
 Tiramon: *fun
 WINWINWIN: Tiramon how long did it take to built the NN?
 Tiramon: pure coding? 1 or 2hit took most time to build the environment to train it
 WINWINWIN: Nice, debugging is not too difficult with a NN?
 Tiramon: i won't debug agents.. if i had to debug a trained agent something in my code would be wrongsometimes i seed his training so he learns about moves that he didn't recognize in his current training
 WINWINWIN: AntiSquid finally debugged and got a  decent heuristic for BotG, crushing Bronze boss...
 WINWINWIN: Is a sim needed for legend?
 Astrobytes: Wow. Switch topics much WINWINWIN? :P
 Tiramon: guess you won't need a sim for gold, i don't have sim and am almost at gold
 Tiramon: for legend, i guess you need at least a partial sim
 WINWINWIN: :D Astrobytes
 jrke: WINWINWIN bronze or silver in BotG
 WINWINWIN: Getting to Silver soon
 jrke: nice
 jrke: WINWINWIN my sim worked in some manner and now improving it
 WINWINWIN: Well done
 Imsure1200q: when is active time of euler
 Astrobytes: Let me look into my crystal ball...
 JBM: depends
 JBM: do you have an appointment?
 Imsure1200q: no
 Imsure1200q: just asking cuz i dont wanna ask help and then turns out hes not active lol
 JBM: yes, that ould be ridiculous
 JBM: please do that
 Imsure1200q: lol no
 Imsure1200q: but maybe somtimes
 Astrobytes: Words to live by
 Imsure1200q: how to see if u solved the validators
 Astrobytes: Submit
 Astrobytes: if you get 100%, you solved the validators
 Astrobytes: If you don't, open the Results panel and you'll see how many you failed
 Astrobytes: Have you submitted yet?
 Astrobytes: ...
 jrke: ...
 Astrobytes: Hi jrke
 jrke: hlo
 cegprakash: show us ur replay jrke
 jrke: 100% now
 jrke: but time greater than my best one means without sim
 jrke: can i make it 40 ms instead of 35 ms
 Imsure1200q: w
 Astrobytes: Imsure1200q did you submit
 Imsure1200q: no
 jrke:  what is the radius of car
 Astrobytes: Imsure1200q then you can't know if you've passed the validators...
 Imsure1200q: im just asking cuz i wanted see how to do it
 Imsure1200q: but i didnt made the program yet
 Astrobytes: Right. I see.
 Imsure1200q: later when im done with program i will
 Astrobytes: That would be sensible.
 Imsure1200q: is fortran supported
 Imsure1200q: in codingame
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Imsure1200q: ok thxn
 cegprakash: did anyone pass SearchRace using full 50 ms?
 cegprakash: I mean all test cases
 jrke: test 39 have bugs maybe
 cegprakash: not just 39
 Astrobytes: I think you have to not go over 35ms or something. Ask Illedan when you see him.
 jrke: cause only it fails when i try to use 40+ms or sometimes 36+ms
 cegprakash: it even fails for 35 ms
 cegprakash: I only use 30 ms
 jrke: ya sometimes
 jrke: same i did
 jrke: but time is 14800 mine why after sim
 Astrobytes: Yeah, due to small time spikes
 Astrobytes: So ~30ms should be OK
 cegprakash: that's so nice! now work on performance tweaks and eval jrke
 jrke: ya working on that whats tweaks
 cegprakash: remove arrays from ur funtions
 cegprakash: use global array
 jrke: k
 cegprakash: I saw a lot of such stuff on ur code
 jrke: ya
 jrke: getting 20 k sim at depth 7
 jrke: 30 ms
 Lexh55: Has anyone completed the temps in java?
 cegprakash: I get 40K jrke
 jrke: what depth 
 jrke: 5 
 jrke: or 4
 cegprakash: hey Astrobytes teach jrke mutations if u are free
 Imsure1200q: oo i need this lecture
 Imsure1200q: lol is it possible to have two solutions for 1 case
 Astrobytes: Not free ceg, it's not hard though. Just take your solution, copy it and randomise some parameter. Then keep it if it's better
 jrke: i m taking set of random moves then i evaluate them and choose the best
 cegprakash: yeah
 cegprakash: now u have ur best
 cegprakash: now change something in ur best sim
 cegprakash: and re-evaluate
 Astrobytes: then you can mutate your best to see if you get something better
 cegprakash: if this is better keep tihs
 jrke: K
 cegprakash: u can do this for 10K iterations
 Astrobytes: You can always mutate or you can have a probability to mutate
 cegprakash: 10K for simulations, 10K for mutate
 Astrobytes: See what works for you
 jrke: i didn't know mutation
 jrke: this is my sim

 Astrobytes: It's one step on from random, heading towards the direction of a GA
 Lexh55: When I checked the discussion board, there was comments about some need for a if statement 
 cegprakash: in my code I use a 10% probability to alter the solution
 cegprakash: and I re-evaluate this solution
 cegprakash: and if this is better than my computed best keep this
 jrke: K
 jrke: means to re-evaluate random sims is that thing
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Take your best current random solution, mutate if probability is x, re-evaluate mutated solution and keep it if it's better.
 jrke: i saw 10% probality rand()%10
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you can change your probability and see what works for you.
 jrke: i m going for a while talk to you later
 jrke: thanks for mutation
 Astrobytes: cool, you're welcome
 cegprakash: I'm 10 points behind #13&#160;:'(
 WINWINWIN: 10 points is barely anything, spam submit?
 struct: Maybe he already spam submitted
 WINWINWIN: I dont understand how this happened, 1700+ in BOTG contest but only 846 in multi&#160;:/
 struct: People didnt resubmit on multi
 struct: It wasnt automated before
 WINWINWIN: Oh, then you would have gained 2x the XP for reaching legend?
 Astrobytes: And you waited sometimes a few weeks for the multi after the contest
 struct: yes
 cegprakash: i get banned for spam submit
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Astrobytes: *again*
 struct: If you are hoping to get a lucky submit you better just hardcode
 cegprakash: no not again.. generally
 WINWINWIN: So that`s euler`s secret to lvl 52&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: No. He stayed at 50 for ages until they removed the level cap a short while back. He's since gone up 2 levels so ...
 WINWINWIN: Oh, didnt know that there was a level cap earlier
 WINWINWIN: Valkyrie is practically useless in BotG right?
 Imsure1200q: euler u on
 Astrobytes: Just wait til later if you see him in chat ffs
 eulerscheZahl: i just logged in 30s ago :D
 Imsure1200q: wow majic
 Imsure1200q: euler im questioning how possible testcase 22 is
 JBM: harassment works \o/
 Imsure1200q: in spacemaz

 RoboStac: can pass it in go, just c# debug is too slow&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for sharing your solution in a way that makes it accessible for me
 RoboStac: yeah, I wanted to see what the other solutions were
 RoboStac: seems me and shadow had very similar ideas
 Imsure1200q: ahh im so dumb aaa
 Imsure1200q: thnx
 Imsure1200q: x euler robo
 Imsure1200q: ugh my chrome lags
 Imsure1200q: guys does codingame lag for you
 K4Mx: is there admin to debug a specific game issue&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: no. but share your issue here, maybe you don't need an admin for it
 K4Mx: Onitama = i receive pmov potential moves from the game input , 
 K4Mx: it seems this input is polluted somehow by the game where i see enemi potential move cards
 eulerscheZahl: Onitama is in my responsibility
 eulerscheZahl: first of all: which language are you using? python?
 K4Mx: ok then i have no idea what is going on why this bug 
 K4Mx: python yes
 eulerscheZahl: i guess you print the input to stderr to examine it?make sure to flush the output
 eulerscheZahl: print(.., flush=True)
 K4Mx: the gameinput M 
 K4Mx:&#160;?
 cegprakash: yaay #13 :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39353d93-615d-4de8-97d6-54f4cd66cbed">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39353d93-615d-4de8-97d6-54f4cd66cbed</a>
 eulerscheZahl: when you don't flush, you might not see the full input and just think you miss something while you get all of it
 eulerscheZahl: also make sure to print exactly 1 command per turn and read all the input
 eulerscheZahl: more complete example:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fe4fa7bd-fe7c-4a94-a32b-adba4b1c650e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fe4fa7bd-fe7c-4a94-a32b-adba4b1c650e</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and it's intentional that you get all possible move cards including the opponent
 K4Mx: i flush everywhere now xD
 eulerscheZahl: the ones with owner == player_id are your moves
 K4Mx: wait it seems the example is getting only the player potential moves no&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: you should get something like this as the input:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/be5e9d11-6de4-46e0-a502-05e1f874fe0f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/be5e9d11-6de4-46e0-a502-05e1f874fe0f</a>
 K4Mx: yes so the game is not givin enemy pmov
 K4Mx: though i guess you can compute them 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/ssdexp">https://prnt.sc/ssdexp</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the possible opponent moves depend on your own action. so there is no point in giving them
 K4Mx: not realy , you can precompute his move since the cards universe is limited
 eulerscheZahl: but then you capture one unit of your opponent, removing that possible action
 K4Mx: i just need to look at all input the example is not showing all 
 K4Mx: what&#160;? i mean lookin at your cards, the stock card you can compute future enemy moves
 eulerscheZahl: you are given all possible moves for yourself
 K4Mx: since he will have your cards
 K4Mx: yes
 K4Mx: possible moves for opponent is left as an exercise
 K4Mx: iiuc
 K4Mx: its just python example is not really showing all 
 eulerscheZahl: the possible moves are just to help you getting started. those who try seriously will reimplement the full game engine anyways to generate valid moves
 K4Mx: omg xD
 eulerscheZahl: top players plan 6 turns ahead or even more
 eulerscheZahl: so there's no point anymore giving that as input. it's only meant to help you getting started. if you don't want to go hardcore or verify your move generator
 K4Mx: depth = 6 , i was thinkin about that
 K4Mx: thx for hint
 K4Mx: still get this bug 
 jrke: i m going at depth 7
 eulerscheZahl: i assume you don't have anything advanced yet? then you can share your code here in chat
 eulerscheZahl: for more sophisticated code use a private message
 K4Mx: ah well ok then ill just stop playin xD are you satisifed with winin the mental game her e? 
 K4Mx: i go depth 7777 
 K4Mx: nothin advanced no
 eulerscheZahl: here is no result for your request «jrke»
 K4Mx: in particular with this random happening bug 
 eulerscheZahl: submit your bot then
 K4Mx: proof or it did not happen yep
 K4Mx: i have no idea with this bug its like my bot is playin an opponen card in advance 
 eulerscheZahl: paste your code here
 K4Mx: its like an element of pmov is poluted at some point , with a move which do not exist at any point in the created list 
 K4Mx: i need to remove some part for cp paste 
 K4Mx: debug is like that 
 K4Mx: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06988da4-4518-4d52-8c9c-a387da73933e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06988da4-4518-4d52-8c9c-a387da73933e</a>
 Astrobytes: Just paste your code, honestly
 K4Mx: all the pmov are legal moves, but when i print its printing an illegal move
 eulerscheZahl: pretty sure you have 2 print statements in your while True: loop
 eulerscheZahl: can't tell without code
 K4Mx: yep but conditional
 K4Mx: is this bad coding practice&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: print only 1 line for each loop iteration
 eulerscheZahl: or everything will get out of sync
 K4Mx: maybe i should store the move and print last&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: that's not only for Onitama. it's for every game here on CG
 K4Mx: which loop you are talkin about&#160;? the While right&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: the main loop which read the input and writes the output
 Astrobytes: Paste your code, nobody will steal it or think badly of you K4Mx, it'll be easier to help you 
 K4Mx: well this is bad code xD
 eulerscheZahl: and we don't judge about horrible code
 Astrobytes: We're not judging you 
 Astrobytes: euler... :D
 darkhorse64: Liars&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: i thought it too Astrobytes :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 K4Mx: inb4  THIS IS SHIT CODE OMG 
 K4Mx: xDDD
 jrke: if you see my code its a mess but i improved my coding from contest
 Astrobytes: Relax man, don't worry about it
 eulerscheZahl: inb4 "i'm annoyed, figure it our yourself if you don't share code"
 K4Mx: ok ill try to fix
 K4Mx: if not working il paste
 eulerscheZahl: ok
 Astrobytes: Cool beans
 K4Mx: thanks a lot for help
 jrke: Astrobytes mutation done
 Astrobytes: Nice jrke, any improvements?
 jrke: ya 7 frames in first test going to submit
 Astrobytes: cool
 jrke: yup 300 time decreased but my best is 13512 without sim and 14654 with sim looks i have evaluation problem
 K4Mx: is it just a race for depth&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Double check your sim too
 eulerscheZahl: then use your heuristic as initial solution
 K4Mx: nvm
 eulerscheZahl: and try to modify it
 jrke: whats heuristic
 eulerscheZahl: the part without sim
 Astrobytes: your non-sim version
 Astrobytes: ...
 jrke: K
 wlesavo: now astro clearly just retyping every phrase euler says
 Astrobytes: lol!
 Astrobytes: I wish. Then he wouldn't really beat me to it so much
 eulerscheZahl: i find it funny. not the fact that i'm faster but that we think the same so often
 K4Mx: rock n roll
 K4Mx: one print made the deal
 eulerscheZahl: great, submit time&#160;;)
 K4Mx: nope
 Astrobytes: true eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 K4Mx: there is an issue with the rule
 K4Mx: capture shrine is one turn&#160;? 
 K4Mx: its not instant
 Astrobytes: Well, at least it works now 
 K4Mx: right&#160;? 
 K4Mx: also i dont understand the PASS command
 eulerscheZahl: when your master reaches the opponent shrine, you win
 K4Mx: not a knight&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: PASS is just if there is no valid move. i haven't seen in happen yet
 eulerscheZahl: only the master can capture the shrine
 K4Mx: you cannot PASS if there is a valid move&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 K4Mx: also not clear in rules
 K4Mx: thx
 eulerscheZahl: "f there is no valid move, a player can PASS a card of his choice"
 wlesavo: interesting, i got my hypersonic bot right under the gold boss, so now i can spy on cheaters just by checking last battles
 K4Mx: what is a PASS command example&#160;? you have one&#160;? PASS + cardi d? 
 wlesavo: already got one
 K4Mx: valid on that card or valid on all cards 
 darkhorse64: Filter with sayonara&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: cheaters in gold?
 Astrobytes: lol, wlesavo has taken the duty of Guardian of Hypersonic :D
 eulerscheZahl: yes, PASS idbut i don't think that you will need it
 Astrobytes: Well, they must pass gold to reach legend eulerscheZahl
 wlesavo: euler well the new ones submitting all the time
 K4Mx: thx pass + id it is 
 wlesavo: dam, now im the one retyping
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: jacek gets one PASS in about 100 games in his simulation. that is at depth 6 or so, nothing that happens on the real board
 eulerscheZahl: so you parked your bot below the boss a while ago wlesavo?
 wlesavo: the game is actually really fun
 wlesavo: no just yeasterday
 eulerscheZahl: one of my faforites
 K4Mx: which one&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: i know i spelled that wrong
 eulerscheZahl: HyperSonic
 K4Mx: ok
 eulerscheZahl: but keep playing Onitama&#160;;)
 K4Mx: ofc
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 wlesavo: after playing sonic i thing pac would benefit from not having fog of war
 jrke: this is my best simulation replay <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/470651580">https://www.codingame.com/replay/470651580</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the fog made me doubt if i can motivate myself to even play it at first
 eulerscheZahl: still not really a fan of it
 eulerscheZahl: enough strategic depth without
 wlesavo: true
 wlesavo: my HS "sim" suc though, and even that almost reached legend
 eulerscheZahl: legend used to be easier in the past
 eulerscheZahl: weaker bosses
 eulerscheZahl: and contestants weren't that strong either, community improved
 wlesavo: so probably pac wouldnt be much harder for nonsim players anyway, maybe even easier
 eulerscheZahl: sure, there were some strong players back then. but i managed to beat contest #3 within a week. i'm pretty sure i wouldn't rank third if it was a contest now
 eulerscheZahl: the fog adds some uncertainty (corner deaths), making the outcomes more random
 eulerscheZahl: sure, you can deduct a lot sometimes. a good tracker is worth a lot for this game
 eulerscheZahl: but sometimes the tracking possibilities are limited
 eulerscheZahl: maybe next contest
 eulerscheZahl: or at mini raic
 wlesavo: it felt like tracker would only help gathering, very rare cases for killing/escaping death
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even try to escape
 wlesavo: deadends thing was good enough for escaping most of the times i think
 WINWINWIN: In most pathing based multis, having a BFS / DFS does not matter much until there are offensive options right?
 eulerscheZahl: BFS finds the shortest path, DFS doesn't
 WINWINWIN: Yes, but if there were no offensive options, would a BFS matter?
 eulerscheZahl: it really depends on your specific use-casei don't see a way to give a generic answer
 WINWINWIN: Yes, I could not find any use for BFS other than avoiding bombds
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/bender---episode-4">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/bender---episode-4</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/the-water-jug-riddle-from-die-hard-3">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/the-water-jug-riddle-from-die-hard-3</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/zergling-rush">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/zergling-rush</a>
 eulerscheZahl: some puzzles where BFS will work better than DFS
 WINWINWIN: I meant using BFS as an alternate to the in-built A* pathfinding, not when the problem is to make a Pathfinder
 eulerscheZahl: if you want a shortest path, use BFS. i thought i was clear on this
 WINWINWIN: Yes, my bad
 eulerscheZahl: DFS finds any path
 WINWINWIN: Yes
 DJLonelyKitten_189e: how to start javarscipt perferctly guys  ? 
 Tiramon: nice ... contest is over and the chat is still alive&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid:&#160;:)
 Alshock:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: DJLonelyKitten_189e I think that Magus is an expert with JS
 Alshock: we're such babies
 AntiSquid: omg ban WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: ban?
 Alshock: develop "perfectly"
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 will do it
 Automaton2000: there is no real reason
 WINWINWIN: :D
 AntiSquid: you went off topic
 Alshock: Ouch, sick burn
 WINWINWIN: off topic?
 WINWINWIN: DJLonelyKitten asked&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: broke smiley chain
 WINWINWIN: :D
 AntiSquid: ah god my jokes are shit i guess, not sure how to make it more obv
 Alshock: @AntiSquid you can't say no more, Automaton2000 told you off :P
 Automaton2000: if you were to write a simu
 AntiSquid: which game Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i am stuck at the top
 Alshock: real life
 AntiSquid: maybe real life is already a simulation
 WINWINWIN: (Another off topic)&#160;:) AntiSquid isnt valkyrie worthless in BOTG?
 Alshock: plz make the referee open source
 AntiSquid: check gold boss WINWINWIN
 AntiSquid: also no
 AntiSquid: def not
 AntiSquid: even if her skills didn't do damage she'd still be great since you can displace enemy heroes
 AntiSquid: imagine a flip next to tower and then stun
 WINWINWIN: I dont understand how to use it, you either go for long ranged (IM &amp; DS) or melee(Hulk &amp; DP)
 AntiSquid: moving heroes out of position can be very strong in real MOBAs, why would it be useless here?
 AntiSquid: some strats are easier to implement, that's all
 WINWINWIN: Makes sense
 WINWINWIN: But range seems vital here...
 AntiSquid: i mean she can jump to reposition herself and then she can move an enemy hero to the wrong position which puts them at disadvantage
 WINWINWIN: Hmm, that would be quite helpful.
 DJLonelyKitten_189e: who is magus bro&#160;?
 AntiSquid: also she has longer range tahn the other melee heroes WINWINWIN
 AntiSquid: and she has kinda same stats too
 WINWINWIN: pretty low damage
 Astrobytes: Damage doesn't matter in her case
 Astrobytes: Like squids saying, you can use her power strategically
 AntiSquid: you can farm creeps more safely with her
 WINWINWIN: Yes, but seems pretty difficult to implement
 eulerscheZahl: Hulk+Hulk used to be a strong combo
 WINWINWIN: 2 heroes of same type not allowed?
 AntiSquid: there's a valkyre + doctor strange combo and that is very strong at displacing enemy line up
 Astrobytes: Depends if it's a live contest or not :P
 eulerscheZahl: i still remember the chat: someone complaining about a guy using two hulks at the top of gold beating him up heavily
 WINWINWIN: Bug in the referee during the contest?
 eulerscheZahl: we: that's not possible!he: shares replay
 Astrobytes: I wasn't even there and I know about it lol
 WINWINWIN: :D
 AntiSquid: wonder how the meta would have looked like if people put more effort into valk+ strange
 AntiSquid: oh btw there were 2 more heroes supposed to be added
 WINWINWIN: which ones?
 eulerscheZahl: you can still find them in code comments
 eulerscheZahl: lancer is one. or was that valkyrie?
 AntiSquid: some super long range sniper and a curse mage dealing damage over time
 AntiSquid: lancer = valk
 eulerscheZahl: but sprites were too expensive?
 AntiSquid: no
 eulerscheZahl: i vaguely remember that BotG wasn't a cheap contest
 AntiSquid: requests to simplify game
 AntiSquid: not best graphics for the price
 WINWINWIN: I like the Silver boss technique of activating groots near the opponent, there was no mention of it in any PM
 eulerscheZahl: that's how people won vs the gold boss
 eulerscheZahl: boss completely ignored groots
 WINWINWIN: Will add it now quite interesting
 AntiSquid: also ille's gf done much better HUD + reworked the lane units, they looked weird before
 K4Mx: how do we know which library are availab for python for instance&#160;? 
 WINWINWIN: FAQ link.
 AntiSquid: quite sure there's a command for that?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://blog.revathskumar.com/2011/10/python-list-all-packages-installed.html">https://blog.revathskumar.com/2011/10/python-list-all-packages-installed.html</a>

 AntiSquid: or google for other source
 eulerscheZahl: Includes NumPy 1.16.2, pandas 0.24.2, SciPy 1.2.1
 eulerscheZahl: that's the libraries you can use on CG
 K4Mx: another question
 K4Mx: are you quite confident about containers / sandbox security between players and admin / site
 K4Mx: has it been battletested&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: every usercode runs in something similar to docker
 reCurse: Let's just say it's received a lot of attention over the years
 K4Mx: i dont want to discover that bot#1 has just hacked through containers and read all codes xD
 reCurse: Lots of players have tested all kinds of shenanigans
 reCurse: Whatever was found has been fixed so far
 eulerscheZahl: and now that users can upload their own games, CG protected that aspect good too. at least i failed to inject some JS code that isn't supposed to be there
 K4Mx: good
 K4Mx: policy is ban&#160;? 
 reCurse: No, policy is fix
 reCurse: Except if contest prizes are involved, then possibly DQ
 K4Mx: are you killin whitehats&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: CG is really cool when it comes to reporting things you accessing stuff that you aren't supposed to see
 K4Mx: ok thx
 eulerscheZahl: then fix it and thank you for reporting
 eulerscheZahl: they*
 K4Mx: got it 
 AntiSquid: contest cheats weren't banned last contest
 AntiSquid: just removed from ladder
 Astrobytes: And it's usually prudent to report the issue privately, of coursee
 Astrobytes: *course
 reCurse: Yeah but I think copy/paste is a different story than what we're talking about here
 K4Mx: would be interesting to work at CG sec 
 K4Mx: anyway lets code
 eulerscheZahl: CG has interns sometimes
 K4Mx: im old xD
 Astrobytes: :older_man:
 Imsure1200q: has anyone brute-forced space maze
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Imsure1200q: eww my profile pic looks like a dentist advertisment from afar
 Astrobytes: He told you this yesterday Imsure1200q
 Astrobytes: When you asked the same question more or less
 Imsure1200q: yes i know
 Imsure1200q: but its not really the same question
 Imsure1200q: cuz yesterday it was about which method to use and i think he said bruteforce isnt so good
 Astrobytes: I thought you were doing a NN, or A*, or hardcoding... now you intend to bruteforce?
 eulerscheZahl: and since my last answer robo submitted a C# solution which might change the answer
 Imsure1200q: oh wait i dont mean bruteforce
 Astrobytes: What did he submit in originally? C++?
 Imsure1200q: i mean like doing every path seeing if its ok
 eulerscheZahl: Go
 Astrobytes: Ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: he has a top10 hypersonic bot in Go too
 eulerscheZahl: and for CSB
 K4Mx: lol
 Astrobytes: Go's pretty decent, my mate keeps trying to force me to learn it
 K4Mx: i wish i had this kind of achievemnt one day xD
 Imsure1200q: its decent??
 K4Mx: "he has a top 10 hypersonic bot in Go" kek
 K4Mx: totaly a girl magnet
 Imsure1200q: anyway ill just move on quickly cuz studying the testcases in Chrome is hell
 eulerscheZahl: you aren't supposed to analyze them by hand but to find a generic solution
 Astrobytes: I think he had thoughts of hardcoding previously
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i cheated to some degree: there were testcases where my heuristic performed poorly and made me timeout. so i just removed them
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: was hoping for proper feedback in the review process
 eulerscheZahl: then one day i logged in to see it's approved
 WINWINWIN: :D
 WINWINWIN: Doesnt your solution have to be given out during the contribution process euler?
 eulerscheZahl: no, i did not have to share my own solution
 Astrobytes: But one should most definitely solve before approving any puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: you have to do this for classic input-output puzzles. but not for interactive contributions with a viewer
 WINWINWIN: But looking at validators is probably a solution&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: the puzzle was pending for a few months without anyone daring to touch it. then someone created 3 fake accounts and approved this and a few other puzzles
 WINWINWIN: 3 fake accounts?
 Astrobytes: ffs
 WINWINWIN: how lvl20 in all?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/big-bang-theory---sheldons-array-puzzle">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/big-bang-theory---sheldons-array-puzzle</a>
 eulerscheZahl: same approvers. and that puzzle was taken almost verbatim from hackerrank
 eulerscheZahl: if it collects enough low ratings and a total of 20 votes, it will disappear
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still waiting for this to happen: create some accounts and give 1 star everywhere
 eulerscheZahl: a lot of puzzles would disappear
 Imsure1200q: seriously hardcoding is heller than studying the testcases
 PJMantoss: Hello everyone
 Imsure1200q: hi
 eulerscheZahl: just 30 testcases, hardcoding is doable
 PJMantoss: I need some help
 WINWINWIN: So guys have to rate it as 0 to remove it?
 Imsure1200q: yeah but theres validators so i cant hardcod
 PJMantoss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ce9ba3cc-3478-41df-89ff-32b6d9d6e000">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ce9ba3cc-3478-41df-89ff-32b6d9d6e000</a>
 eulerscheZahl: many 1 star ratings =&gt; it will disappear
 eulerscheZahl: happens to clash of code sometimes. rare for real puzzles
 Imsure1200q: actually i think i should start working on the alg
 Imsure1200q: or whatever heuristic means
 WINWINWIN: PJMantoss, found nothing does not always mean ouputted nothing
 Imsure1200q: testcase 22 was the worst experience ever
 WINWINWIN: it can also mean that your answer was not complete
 K4Mx: wait how do i vote for onitama&#160;? XD
 eulerscheZahl: you have to pass submit validators which are different to visible tests. you might get 100% without solving test 22
 eulerscheZahl: K4Mx you have to submit your code
 eulerscheZahl: then get back to the overview page
 K4Mx: omg what a diktatorship
 eulerscheZahl: sorry :D
 K4Mx: ill give it 5 star once submited
 K4Mx: dont want this to disappear at all
 eulerscheZahl: unlikely to happen, onitama has a good rating. and i would probably annoy staff until they bring it back :D
 K4Mx: well its on github 
 Imsure1200q: testcase22 is hard but 23 is so easy
 K4Mx: but we need an arena
 Imsure1200q: why is it like dat
 WINWINWIN: :P
 jacek: why 5 star for onitama? its a boring game
 jacek: :c
 eulerscheZahl: Imsure1200q the testcases are randomly generated (except for the first few). so it's possible that they have different difficulty
 eulerscheZahl: so you are the 1 star rating jacek? :P
 Imsure1200q: WAIT WHAT
 Imsure1200q: oh wait you mean randomly generated by euler or smth?
 K4Mx: who gave 1 star to oni&#160;?
 K4Mx: get rekt
 eulerscheZahl: when i created testcases for space maze, i just generated random maps (placing ground, platforms, ...)then I tried to solve these levels. if i could solve them and it wasn't trivial, i kept that testcase
 Imsure1200q: ur the one who generated them?
 K4Mx: fucking sentient bot xD
 jacek: try space onitama
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Imsure1200q: why is it contribution by euler not u
 eulerscheZahl: the knights would die in space, running out of oxygen
 Imsure1200q: is like a bug or smth?
 eulerscheZahl: wizards might survive :thinking:
 K4Mx: lol
 eulerscheZahl: but I am eulerscheZahl?what nickname do you see displayed for me?
 Imsure1200q: nothing
 K4Mx: xDDDDD
 reCurse: Then a magical space helmet isn't out of question
 eulerscheZahl: maybe F5 will add nicknames. no idea
 eulerscheZahl: (save your code before you try)
 K4Mx: im unsure about halucinogenic frog survival in space 
 K4Mx: got to google that
 Imsure1200q: finally it says euler
 K4Mx:  \o/
 eulerscheZahl: i'm no longer incognito&#160;:)
 Imsure1200q: ya i thought u were another account
 Imsure1200q: cuz i scrolled up to see if chrome wasnt recognizing your data but it was and wasnt at the same time
 Imsure1200q:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes CG fails to load chat profiles, no idea why
 eulerscheZahl: then i appear as WatercooledSkull
 Imsure1200q: lol
 jacek: your alt?
 Astrobytes: His real name
 eulerscheZahl: my CG chat name
 WINWINWIN: Real name:thinking:

 Astrobytes: Steel Hippo
 eulerscheZahl: generateNickname(1500515)"WaterCooledSkull_ad41"
 Imsure1200q: baby shark
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes is DoomedScone_d423
 Astrobytes: DoomedScone, I like that. It has a food connection
 Imsure1200q: can your generator generate BabyShark_2222
 Astrobytes: It's what CG generates given your ID
 Imsure1200q: oh no we have id
 Imsure1200q: i wonder if theres someone in here who has nickname BabyShark_2222
 Imsure1200q: hes probably screaming in horror
 eulerscheZahl: you can enter a nickname into the searchbar at the top (not available in the IDE)
 Imsure1200q: im in ide
 Astrobytes: Hmmm... how to solve THAT problem :thinking:
 Imsure1200q: tell html to add search bar element
 Astrobytes: Open another tab?
 Astrobytes: Leave the IDE?
 Imsure1200q: no when u open a tab in chrome it takes forever
 Astrobytes: just opened 5 
 Imsure1200q: exactly
 Astrobytes: in a row
 Astrobytes: less than a second
 Imsure1200q: not in a column
 Imsure1200q: dude thats impossible how
 Astrobytes: Ctrl-t
 Imsure1200q: also when i open new tab and i have to press the home button
 Astrobytes: I can't continue this conversation, sorry
 Imsure1200q: cuz if i type link it will go to some weird browser
 eulerscheZahl: ctrl+windows+C opens a new codingame tab for me.i defined some weird hotkeys :D
 Imsure1200q: wow

 Imsure1200q: i wana port to C++
 Imsure1200q: haha 0 experience
 WINWINWIN: Not necessarily  a troll :D people always tell newbies to invite u to CoC :P
 jacek: who could those people be :thinking:
 Imsure1200q: u
 WINWINWIN: :D
 ClashOfCodeFanatic: Pardon, mais je pensais que eulerscheZahl jouait beaucoup au clash du code, c'est ce que j'ai entendu sur le chat.
 Snef: ClashOfCodeFanatic it is an english channel here
 Astrobytes: He heard you play a lot of clashjes euler
 Astrobytes: *heard
 Imsure1200q: wow now u know french
 Snef: Astrobytes is so talented
 Astrobytes: No I'm extremely far from fluent, but I can sometimes get an idea
 ClashOfCodeFanatic: Sorry
 Imsure1200q: i mean i guess yall have french and spanish classes
 Imsure1200q: like according to the movies
 Astrobytes: 20+ years ago I did
 Imsure1200q: for me i only know 1-2 words french im a genius
 Snef: baguette
 Snef: fromage
 Astrobytes: omelette du fromage
 Imsure1200q: no its c'est and beau
 Imsure1200q: for italian i know pizza
 Imsure1200q: wait 
 Snef: la pizza au fromage c'est beau
 Imsure1200q: whats a fromage
 Snef: guess
 Astrobytes: It's when you come from somewhere
 ClashOfCodeFanatic: cheese
 Snef: spoiler&#160;:(
 Imsure1200q: wow
 ClashOfCodeFanatic:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Stop ruining my fun! :P
 Imsure1200q: spoiled ches
 Imsure1200q: how is cheese beautiful its just a yellow/white/blue thing
 Imsure1200q: its like tofu except its not
 Snef: it was just to reuse the words you said
 Astrobytes: Quote of the Year
 Imsure1200q: except in Big Mac
 Astrobytes: "ts like tofu except its not"
 Astrobytes: *"its like tofu except its not"
 Imsure1200q: its the best word
 JBM: le bigge mak
 Astrobytes: I mean, cats are small, but not as small as spiders.
 Imsure1200q: yeah cuz spiders are 8 legs + ball + ball
 Imsure1200q: and cats play with yarnball
 Astrobytes: Trees are just like waterfalls except they're not.
 Imsure1200q: yeah because the tree sap when it spiels its so sloowww
 Imsure1200q: also if you drink waterfall you dont die but when you drink sap you get hurt
 Astrobytes: Have you completed your Space MAze algorithm yet?
 Imsure1200q: in Tagalog sakit is the same for hurt and sick so hurt is like sick except its not
 Imsure1200q: no 
 Imsure1200q: still studying cases
 Imsure1200q: dont worry im case 25
 Imsure1200q: haha its hell to study it
 Astrobytes: If you spent less time chatting, less time studying cases, and more time coding or researching how you might approach the problem... you know
 Imsure1200q: yeah but the research part is the boring part
 Imsure1200q: like for polygon triangulation when i wanted to know about ear clipping
 Astrobytes: By researching I do not mean coming up with a solution by hand for all testcases
 Imsure1200q: lol
 Imsure1200q: but the videos and papers
 Imsure1200q: lately when i do research it takes hourrssss
 Imsure1200q: except for anatomy and physiology so easy
 Imsure1200q: but when i search A&amp;P for dolphins boom nothing
 Astrobytes: Right.
 Imsure1200q: the Space Maze research is like that except its not
 Astrobytes: Please. Just stop.
 Imsure1200q: stop wat
 Imsure1200q: ahh chatting ok
 Imsure1200q: later after im done testcasesing
 Murch: There seems to be a discussion area for new puzzles. Is it possible to propose an additional testcase to an accepted puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: which puzzle?
 Murch: The puzzle "War"
 eulerscheZahl: that's an official puzzle, not a community contribution. it's unlikely that anything will change there
 Murch: Okay, thanks
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl studying for exam instead of contest worked out
 ZarthaxX: no regrets at least
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: it didn't, you got stuck in gold
 eulerscheZahl: but congrats on your good grades :D
 ZarthaxX: i meant i pass
 ZarthaxX: ...
 ZarthaxX: you savage
 eulerscheZahl: i'm trolling. as usual
 ZarthaxX: i will invite you to a CoC coz of that 
 ZarthaxX: :relaxed:
 eulerscheZahl: then you have to clash yourself
 Imsure1200q: lol euler why tho
 ZarthaxX: i will quit 
 eulerscheZahl: why what? trolling?it's just how I am
 eulerscheZahl: having fun with SmarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: lvl 52, 1st in cg,  troll guy
 ZarthaxX: nice one :thinking:
 Imsure1200q: you know those quit giveaway iPhoneX 2500 subs rn
 ZarthaxX: wat
 Imsure1200q: scammer youtuber
 Imsure1200q: s
 Imsure1200q: you know when the title of the video is "I quit" and the thumbnail is a sad person
 Imsure1200q: and the content summarized is "okay if you sub like and click the bell first 100 to do that will get this 1 iPhone X
 Imsure1200q: and the 6 year old 7 year old fall for it
 Daher: 13 0 6 4 14 20     13   what is the trick
 Imsure1200q: ur clashing rn?
 Imsure1200q: you get the first number and print it
 eulerscheZahl: we need more data
 Daher: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b49bb110-7781-4592-8bad-d49007591856">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b49bb110-7781-4592-8bad-d49007591856</a>
 Daher: it is ok i get it
 Imsure1200q: ok
 Imsure1200q: im done testcasing
 eulerscheZahl: so, what's the next step?
 Imsure1200q: i observe that i can do like a constrained/limited pathfinding
 Imsure1200q: and like move the car every 50ms just in case im still calculating
 Imsure1200q: dumbest observations ever i still need to do something for circling
 Imsure1200q: therefore the next step is making da algorithm knowing it will fail 
 LelouchVC2: Lmao
 LelouchVC2: I'm coding my own Clash of Code submission 
 LelouchVC2: Watch me lose to python programmers
 Imsure1200q: haha python
 struct: you dont need to worry about python in coc
 Imsure1200q: i dont get why jobs like python like i thought its slow and interpreted
 LelouchVC2: why not?
 LelouchVC2: This website is super bias towards python
 struct: there are shorter languages
 Imsure1200q: but why python tho
 LelouchVC2: I tried it out once, and the test cases ran 10x faster than on C++
 WINWINWIN: LelouchVC2 nobody thinks that :P
 struct: are you saying that python is 10x faster than c++?
 Imsure1200q: i thought python was interpreted?
 LelouchVC2: Black people think that. Checkmate
 Imsure1200q: dude lol thats kinda harsh
 WINWINWIN: C++ in multis and ruby / perl in CoC
 LelouchVC2: I'm saying this website runs python faster than C++
 struct: lo
 struct: lol
 LelouchVC2: Which is why it's bias towards it
 WINWINWIN: lol
 Imsure1200q: lol cuz u need to compile C++?
 LelouchVC2: Damn bro, never knew that
 LelouchVC2: Why would they compile C++
 LelouchVC2: It's mind blowing
 Imsure1200q: like they can use a G++ or ninja
 WINWINWIN: do you honestly think that python is faster than C++ even on CG?
 LelouchVC2: When running tests, yes
 Imsure1200q: no cuz when i installed anaconda and jupyter it never worked so i never tried it
 LelouchVC2: C++ runs slow HERE
 Imsure1200q: weird
 Imsure1200q: so i wont port my code to c++ then
 struct: its still faster than any other language here
 LelouchVC2: Yes, in practical use
 Imsure1200q: so python is the fastest lang in this website?
 LelouchVC2: But whatver this site is using to run code
 LelouchVC2: Is making it slow
 LelouchVC2: I haven't tested "fastest", but definitely faster than c++
 struct: It isn't
 Astrobytes: Faster C++ code?
 LelouchVC2: really unfair when a fastest mode has like 8 tests
 struct: You dont even need that to be faster than python
 LelouchVC2: And the site takes about 30 seconds to go through them
 LelouchVC2: While Python would literally do it in about 5
 Astrobytes: No shit struct
 WINWINWIN: he means faster to type&#160;:/ cant believe anyone would think that C++ performs worse
 Astrobytes: This convo is just...
 Imsure1200q: cuz when i compile my c++ even if the file is LONGGG its still very fast
 WINWINWIN: :dizzy_face:
 LelouchVC2: On this site
 LelouchVC2: Or in general
 Imsure1200q: On my PC terminal
 LelouchVC2: It's like I'm talking to a wall
 struct: I feel the same
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Imsure1200q: its a nice wal
 LelouchVC2: A beautiful wall &lt;3
 Imsure1200q: there are probably 100 people spectating this convo
 Imsure1200q: we just dont notioce
 Imsure1200q: *notice
 goore: true
 LelouchVC2: George Bush did 9/11
 goore: dont go around letting important secrets out
 WINWINWIN: Is C++ faster than Python on codingame Automaton2000
 Imsure1200q: i can feel someone looking at the chat and thinking "how did this coding website turn into a beautiful wall"
 Automaton2000: it is a bit slower
 LelouchVC2: Well, I've lost to python once again
 WINWINWIN: Wow!! pretty smart Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: managed to find everything regarding angles there
 LelouchVC2: I can get this only down to 500 characters
 LelouchVC2: Python programmer got it to 250
 Imsure1200q: why doesnt codingame run on c++ tho?
 WINWINWIN: 250?? in python
 WINWINWIN: should be a lot shorter for practically anything
 Imsure1200q: so thats why codingame uses python because low file size?
 LelouchVC2: i made this CoC, it has a lot going on
 LelouchVC2: 250 in python is reasonable
 struct: not good for the best language
 LelouchVC2: To get to 500 I removed  spaces 
 WINWINWIN: Probably
 LelouchVC2: Best language huh?
 Imsure1200q: nah im on the c++ side
 LelouchVC2: Who isn't on the C++ side
 Imsure1200q: the only reason why im learning python is to interpret what every programmer puts in their blog tutorials
 Imsure1200q: i mean every programmer nowadays
 Imsure1200q: i love c++ its my main after javascript
 Imsure1200q: asm
 LelouchVC2: That doesn't sound righ
 LelouchVC2: t
 LelouchVC2: You love C++, but then you also like Javascript
 Imsure1200q: i like javascript because very flexible but i like C++ because when you compile its faster than IE7
 LelouchVC2: Internet Explorer 7?
 Imsure1200q: ys
 LelouchVC2: lmao!
 Imsure1200q: microsoft edge is fast but its so gross imo
 LelouchVC2: Looks nicer than any IE version
 Imsure1200q: yes but its too similar to IE color pallete
 Imsure1200q: gives me nostalgia of IE inconvenience
 LelouchVC2: I don't use it, but it looked nice and felt good when I sometimes need to pull it up
 LelouchVC2: Usually to install Chrome
 Imsure1200q: I like firefox tho cuz its fast for me
 K4Mx: something is wrong 
 Imsure1200q: hat
 Imsure1200q: what
 K4Mx: how do we get which side we are on onitama
 LelouchVC2: You pull out a compas
 Imsure1200q: l
 eulerscheZahl: it's given in your ID (player_id, first input above the main loop)
 K4Mx: can we reverse the boss to 1 to test&#160;? 
 K4Mx: i should have no submited euler you influenced me xD
 Astrobytes: Swap the players i nthe IDE
 jacek: just wait when he is gonna trying to figure out player's 2 card movements
 eulerscheZahl: Onitama boss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Onitama/blob/master/config/level1/Boss.java">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Onitama/blob/master/config/level1/Boss.java</a>
 K4Mx: i dont see where to swap
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that was the question. delete both you and the boss
 Astrobytes: Players, under the avatars, delete
 eulerscheZahl: then add again using the plus
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 K4Mx: thx
 Astrobytes: . . .
 Astrobytes: :D
 K4Mx: how to unsubmit my botz
 eulerscheZahl: once submitted to the arena, it will stay there forever
 Astrobytes: Not possible. You *must* improve now :D
 K4Mx: FUCK IT xD thx 
 K4Mx: we had a lenghty fight astro
 Astrobytes: In Onitama? I have a bot there?
 K4Mx: what a troll
 Astrobytes: No seriously, I forgot
 eulerscheZahl: i wanted to check if you are there Astrobytes. why am I not following you?
 Astrobytes: I added 3 lines, and modified 1, and that's my bot
 K4Mx: .....
 Astrobytes: No idea eulerscheZahl, but the issue is now resolved&#160;:)
 LelouchVC2: That was me in the pacman stuff
 jacek: Astrobytes youre 9th in wood 2
 Astrobytes: K4Mx, sorry I added 4 lines
 K4Mx: ofc 
 LelouchVC2: Unforgivable
 Astrobytes: Yeah found it jacek lol
 jacek: ow can i see wood 2 leaderboard?

 jacek: what a bunch of noobs
 Astrobytes: I haven't played it since I submitted
 eulerscheZahl: how kind of you :D
 Imsure1200q: euler
 Imsure1200q: for your solution to circling im confused
 eulerscheZahl: why?
 Imsure1200q: cuz you bring id: 1 out of orbit then you bring it back inside?
 eulerscheZahl: do you see the full replay? broken monitor?
 eulerscheZahl: overlapping windows
 Imsure1200q: ya i did
 Astrobytes: Broken something at least
 K4Mx: which side play first&#160;? blue or red&#160;? 
 jacek: yes
 K4Mx: lol
 K4Mx: fuck u xD
 eulerscheZahl: red
 K4Mx: thx
 K4Mx: why am i playin this and not CoD
 K4Mx: strange world we live in
 Astrobytes: Because CoD is rubbish. Real men play ArmA
 LelouchVC2: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 LelouchVC2: I tried to get into Arma, but couldnt&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: Arma what?Armageddon?
 K4Mx: real men play kerbal space program 
 K4Mx: get real
 Astrobytes: I don't play much anymore, used to play with some mates most Sundays
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl It's a military sim game
 LelouchVC2: I don't like how specific the orders have to be sometimes
 Astrobytes: It's a mil-sim!! What you expect?
 LelouchVC2: And there's also a lot of technical stuff that you can't know, that you just have to play a lot to finally get
 LelouchVC2: Well, there's a toystory game that was similar, but in a nice way
 LelouchVC2: There was an AI, so your soldiers would actually do basic things unless you ordered them otherwise
 Astrobytes: A military sim based on... Toy STory?
 LelouchVC2: army men rts
 Astrobytes: ffs
 LelouchVC2: I played it when I was young :3 that was the shit back in the day
 Astrobytes: No, I liked the coop of Arma, headsets and the er... thrill of combat (getting shot a lot)
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm debugging
 K4Mx: you need resubmit tu update&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: y
 K4Mx: thx &lt;3
 Astrobytes: es
 LelouchVC2: 1v1 &lt;3
 K4Mx: 2 vs universe &lt;3
 LelouchVC2: That sounds unfair. For the universe
 K4Mx: like we care&#160;? 
 Imsure1200q: euler this is the replay i had to do

 Imsure1200q: yeah but that wasnt ur solution
 Imsure1200q: oh wait im being dumb
 struct: Oh god im playing coc
 struct: I regret
 LelouchVC2: Well, if ur not gay then dont do it
 LelouchVC2: Don't let them pressure you
 K4Mx: wait you kept same variable for the board as reds and blues&#160;? 
 struct: pressure me?
 K4Mx: W = is boss or enemy depending on red / blue&#160;?
 K4Mx: W = is boss or master depending on red / blue&#160;?
 K4Mx: yes you did

 Astrobytes: Ever get that troll-ish feeling?
 jacek: huh?
 jacek: there is b B w W
 eulerscheZahl: "at no point anything disappears into orbit there"
 Imsure1200q: im gonna start the alg tomorrow
 Imsure1200q: im done defining classes and stuff now i need 2 sleep lol bye
 Astrobytes: You said that yesterday.
 Imsure1200q: yes but i woke up vry late
 Imsure1200q: aka overslept
 Astrobytes: Thanks for the clarity on that.
 Imsure1200q: but i mean i just got started into the alg but i need to sleep already
 Imsure1200q: so tomorrow its definite that ill do the alg first thing
 Imsure1200q: but ya ill sleep now lol by
 Astrobytes: And which algorithm will it be?
 Imsure1200q: i dont know its name or if it even exists but i have one in mind
 Astrobytes: I see.
 Imsure1200q: what? i dont see why it would fail.
 Astrobytes: When did I say it would fail?
 Imsure1200q: step by step it still executes ok except i havent put it into code yet
 Astrobytes: How does it execute then?
 Imsure1200q: ill explain it tom cuz i need to slep
 Astrobytes: I see.
 eulerscheZahl: good night
 Imsure1200q: good night (but its morning for mee)
 Astrobytes: Don't oversleep now.
 Imsure1200q: dont think i will cuz my brother will do something early in morning
 Imsure1200q: will be woken up
 Imsure1200q: by the noise
 Imsure1200q: ok bye
 Astrobytes:  Isee.
 K4Mx: can we debug for arena battle&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: there is a button to send the game to IDE. works if both bots are deterministic
 Astrobytes: And set to Manual so the seed remains the same
 K4Mx:  ... ok thx 
 K4Mx: where manual you mean&#160;? 
 K4Mx: in the random call&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: In Options
 Astrobytes: Tab next to Players
 eulerscheZahl: activate expert mode
 Astrobytes: if you don't see it you neeed Expert Mode
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Settings on the left 
 K4Mx: thx
 eulerscheZahl: was about to write about the settings, replaced it by :D
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: It's quite uncanny sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: ctrl+Z to get it back:settings on the leftexactly the same except for the uppercase S
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i'm afk, cycling around without a real target
 Astrobytes: cool, enjoy
 jacek: in other words, he wants coc invitation
 K4Mx: i beat your bot astro x) 
 Astrobytes: Unsurprising considering I spent approx 5 mins on it lol
 Astrobytes: Good job anyway, next league?
 K4Mx: i hope the basics of the game stay the same&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Yeah I don't believe there's anything new in the next league
 K4Mx: ih ope until the end bc iwant to improve AI not parsin game
 Astrobytes: Only 2 leagues in this one
 jacek: next league is the same
 K4Mx: what about top leagues&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: There's only 2
 jacek: its community game, so only wood leagues
 K4Mx: so always the same game input parameter and rules but just improv bot right&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Yup
 K4Mx: that is perfect
 K4Mx: thx
 Astrobytes: yw
 jacek: actually there is no boss
 K4Mx: what was that small bip sound&#160;? 
 K4Mx: going other league&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: yeah
 jacek: notification
 Astrobytes: 25XP is it? 
 K4Mx: yes 25
 K4Mx: my bot is permanently fighting in wood1&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: Yep
 K4Mx: ok thx
 Astrobytes: Wood 1 is like the 'real' league, Wood 2 is like kindergarten.
 K4Mx: thx 
 K4Mx: im still happy about it  neway
 Astrobytes: Some other community multis have more than 2 wood leagues, some just one
 Astrobytes: Yes, congrats&#160;:)
 K4Mx:&#160;:)
 K4Mx: now i will work with my team xD
 K4Mx: how can i see my wood1 battles
 Astrobytes: They're gone now
 K4Mx: it says 23 / 38 
 K4Mx: i want to see my battles if possible
 Astrobytes: Oh my bad, thought you meant Wood 2, duh
 jacek: refresh and click last battles
 Astrobytes: Last Battles
 K4Mx: thx
 jrke: my sim is working but random moves are sometimes ok and sometimes good and sometimes bad
 jacek: thats definition of random :v
 Astrobytes: ^
 jrke: how you all evaluate your sim
 K4Mx: man , all those C++ bots
 K4Mx: i have a bad feeling about this
 jrke: i have evaluation problem sometimes
 Astrobytes: I haven't finished my Search Race sim/search, just my heuristic version in the leaderboard
 jrke: k
 Astrobytes: Did you try using your non-search code as the base of an eval for your search?
 jrke: not yet
 jrke: i have finished sim but my heuristic version is better than it
 jrke: now seems i have to improve my heuristic one
 Astrobytes: Right, well start with that and work from there
 Astrobytes: No no, do what I suggest for your search eval
 Astrobytes: Keep working on it
 jrke: K
 Astrobytes: You got this&#160;:)
 jrke: ya 
 jrke: hey i wanna know how to check if checkpoint crossed
 jrke: if dist&lt;600 or what
 Astrobytes: Yeah, just check for collision with CP, you have that in your sim right?
 jrke: CP means
 jrke: oh collision predictor
 Astrobytes: Sorry man, checkpoint = CP
 jrke: K
 jrke: maybe i have problem in that only checkpoint crossed or not
 jrke: what is radius of car
 Astrobytes: Don't think there is one for this, just use your position, if you're inside the CP then it's good. Check the referee code
 jrke: oh yeah i  got idea
 Astrobytes: What did you use for CSB?
 Astrobytes: What search alorithm I mean
 Astrobytes: *algorithm
 jrke: no search algo just target-3vel and choosing best thrust you can say sim for thrust and changing checkpoint if i have enough velocity to cross this checkpoint and collision predictor etc
 Astrobytes: Ah right
 jrke: and one pod for opponent blocker
 Astrobytes: Cool. So this is your first search or you have others in other multis?
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/470693482">https://www.codingame.com/replay/470693482</a>
 Astrobytes: Yep, does what you said&#160;:)
 jrke: ya
 jrke: is this ok abs(car.x-checkp.x)&lt;600 and same for y to see checkpoint crossed or not
 Astrobytes: just take the distance
 jrke: means just dist&lt;600
 jrke: sqrt(x-cx*x-cx+y-cy*y-cy)
 jrke: dist method
 Astrobytes: yeah, euclidean distance
 Astrobytes: But 600 is the radius remember, so you can be less than 600 away and still outside the CP
 jrke: means 599
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes&#160;??
 Astrobytes: You called?
 goore: why are coc lobbys so empty
 darkhorse64: "But 600 is the radius remember, so you can be less than 600 away and still outside the CP". This is plain wrong
 darkhorse64: Or I miss something
 Astrobytes: From the inside of the checkpoint, not from the center obviously
 darkhorse64: OK
 Astrobytes: Sorry for the confusion
 darkhorse64: I know you know but that was surprising
 jrke: what a line i know you know:smiley:
 Astrobytes: Just been trying to explain some stuff to jrke in simplest terms
 jrke: can't find dist in refree
 Astrobytes: I could have phrased it a little better on reflection
 darkhorse64: Don't. I am stuck at 12k
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: I've been sidetracked
 Astrobytes: jrke dist? You mean car radius?
 Astrobytes: Or distance calculation?
 jrke: i mean radius in which our car should be to cross this checkpoint
 Astrobytes: "To enter a checkpoint, the center of a car must be within 600 units of the checkpoints center."
 jrke: but i did 589 for safety but not working properly
 Astrobytes: no need to change it
 Astrobytes: use 600
 jrke: but working 
 jrke: *not
 Astrobytes: What did you use in your original (non-search) code?
 AntiSquid: fixing a bug with another "bug" is a downward spiral of doom
 AntiSquid: i did that in pacman contest and i was a really bad idea in hindsight
 Astrobytes: Or patching, depending who you talk to :P
 AntiSquid: it was *
 jrke: i did 400 in non search code
 AntiSquid: maybe you don't find the correct values to aim for the check point
 Astrobytes: Have you checked your collisions to make sure they are working correctly?
 jrke: i haven't did collision for that
 jrke: just if dist&lt;600
 Astrobytes: In your sim
 Astrobytes: If you don't have collision in your sim it's not going to go very well
 jrke: how to check collision 
 jrke: like CSB
 AntiSquid: what collisions do you need&#160;? @_@
 AntiSquid: confused
 jrke: ya im confused
 Astrobytes: Between your car and the chekpoint
 Astrobytes: *checkpoint
 AntiSquid: and why is distance check not enough?
 Astrobytes: He's got a sim and search, something could be way off in his sim
 jrke: so predicting collision like CSB
 jrke:&#160;?
 jrke: or not
 Astrobytes: Essentially yes. Did you read the referee code?
 jrke: ya they had collision
 jrke: if collision time&lt;1 then checkpoint crossed
 jrke: if(col.time &gt;= 0.0 &amp;&amp; col.time + t &lt;= 1.0){
 jrke: from refree
 Astrobytes: This is just CSB with one pod and checkpoints, slightly different referee
 jrke: ya
 jrke: CSB don't have collision for checkpoint
 Astrobytes: ...
 jrke: its 00:53 in India going for a sleep
 Astrobytes: Good idea! Work on it tomorrow
 Astrobytes: gn jrke
 jrke: thanks
 jrke: and gn to you in advance
 Astrobytes: thanks&#160;:)
 anid: Anyone know where I can find the source code for Langton`s Ant?

 eulerscheZahl: click "download"
 Astrobytes: I failed on this because the link is in my other browser :P
 anid: Shouldnt the code be pushed to public as well?
 eulerscheZahl: open the game in the IDE, click "VIEW CONTRIBUTION" at the top above the viewer
 eulerscheZahl: level29+ required
 anid: I see, thanks
 Astrobytes: So, TIL there are no collisions with checkpoints in CSB
 Astrobytes: My head aches from the past hour's chat
 Astrobytes: How was your bike ride eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: great, collected some flies with my eyes
 eulerscheZahl: taking a shower now
 Astrobytes: lol, wear some shades, helps
 jacek: frogs do like flies though
 Astrobytes: *toads
 JBM: is anyone able to give me a clear view of how many "referee" turns / how many "player" turns / what other limitations there are on SDK games?
 JBM: the way i see it there's a 250 "frame" (=referee) default; no expressed max; and something like a 50ms defaut/1s max "player" allowance
 eulerscheZahl: you have some limits: 30s for the total game
 JBM: i'd expect sum(player time) to be what they really limit, but find no trace of that
 eulerscheZahl: at least 50ms per user action
 JBM: ah, there is?
 eulerscheZahl: that allows you to have 600 actions
 JBM: ok
 JBM: but it's not enforced as such?
 eulerscheZahl: you can have "empty" frames without calling any bots
 JBM: yeah that part i figured
 JBM: (and will use)
 eulerscheZahl: these limits are checked and result in a referee crash if you violate them
 JBM: so no real frame limit, but no sane way to abuse them
 eulerscheZahl: there are also limitations on replay size
 JBM: and the other way round...
 JBM: any way to "compress" multiple player turns in a frame?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 Astrobytes: See JBM, this is where you need the community-games-creation discord channel :P
 JBM: unless i write not only a module, but also a significant part of the viewer
 eulerscheZahl: not if it's a sequence of input-output-input-output
 eulerscheZahl: you can request the player to send more than 1 line per turn
 JBM: welll
 JBM: it needs feedback
 eulerscheZahl: but you can't feed additional input then
 eulerscheZahl: that's a problem
 JBM: Astrobytes: i have the view of "this is why they need to document their shit better"
 eulerscheZahl: you can't merge these frames. you can set the frame duration to 0 or close to it (dunno if 0 is possible)
 JBM: scrolling back a clumsy interface is no better than having to rely on eZ
 Astrobytes: I wholly agree with that statement JBM, it's put me off trying to work with it
 JBM: oh nice idea
 eulerscheZahl: but i suppose you can still reach that frame by pausing and using arrow keys
 JBM: yeah that's be acceptable
 JBM: well maybe
 Astrobytes: This is what I was getting at with my comment re. the discrepancy between frames and turns the other day JBM
 JBM: i don't remember
 JBM: oh yes i do
 JBM: the scrolling with arrows thing
 JBM: right?
 Astrobytes: Yes, my last comment mentioned this issue, somewhat vaguely, but it's what I was referring to at least
 JBM: well i'm about to (strive to) make it even worse :p
 Astrobytes: lol
 JBM: sincerely, all i dream of is conjuring the will*time combination
 JBM: to ditch pixi and write a sane &lt;100% CPU viewer
 eulerscheZahl: pixi is GPU hungry
 Astrobytes: re Curse makes similar comments&#160;:)
 JBM: well i'm not measuring
 eulerscheZahl: i noticed when i tried it for the numbershifting website
 JBM: but i certainly noticed that waiting in the car coding while SO was at the doctor's drained my laptop battery crazy fast
 eulerscheZahl: there isn't much going on there. but constantly about 10% load, even if i have a static content and don't click anthing
 eulerscheZahl: stack overflow? makes no sense in this sentence
 JBM: my bird's eye view is it just tries to churn frames as fast as it can with no (reachable AFAIK) limit
 JBM: so 100% CPU is kind of a given
 Astrobytes: Resource-greedy
 JBM: the variable is the frame rate
 eulerscheZahl: there is a limit for everthing. but 3k frames is fine
 JBM: i mean movie frames
 JBM: flicker
 eulerscheZahl: jeez
 JBM: your gpu's likely better than mine
 eulerscheZahl: nvidia geforce gtx 570
 eulerscheZahl: inoryy called it a potato
 JBM: well i'm not even aware whether i have one
 JBM: ok, next trick question
 JBM: is there a way to make the bosses cheat?
 eulerscheZahl: the boss is a regular player. and the referee doesn't know who is playing
 JBM: drat
 eulerscheZahl: if you want player names displayed, that's all done in JS, the java part has no idea
 JBM: gonna have to embed public key crypto then
 JBM: no no
 eulerscheZahl: i got what you mean
 JBM: i want forced replayability of a rather stochastic game
 JBM: (i'll just add the seed)
 JBM: and i wanted something else but i forgot
 eulerscheZahl: i'm off for today, bye
 JBM: gn8
 K4Mx: how can a friend see my bot batttles in wood1 league&#160;? 
 K4Mx: i mean all battles
 jacek: anyone can see your battles
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/onitama/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/onitama/leaderboard</a> find your name and click view last battles
 JBM: oh i remember
 JBM: it was to have a bot play at a specific percentage less than optimal without the time/size limits
 Astrobytes: Bot as in a boss?
 Astrobytes: I think you manually have to 'handicap' them for each league
 JBM: well, yes
 JBM: yes that's my point
 JBM: is rather hard to do, much more in the constrained code/size settings
 JBM: the ref has much fewer of those constraints
 Astrobytes: e.g. the bosses in BR used Smitsimax search, capped to certain depths etc
 Astrobytes: So you're not really constrained that much as per bosses
 Astrobytes: *as per? wrt
 JBM: i feel as much
 JBM: it's like "theoretically no", "in practice..."
 JBM: btw can we even name the bosses yet?
 Astrobytes: Chat to Ille and pb about the BR bosses, might be helpful
 Astrobytes: Don't think so, but don't quote me on that
 JBM: ok, will try to
 Uljahn: MCTS with constant number of rollouts could make boss reproducible with desired strength, no?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's what they did with the Smitsi-based bosses in BR Uljahn
 AntiSquid: +fixed seed
 Uljahn: also fixed seed and custom rand function ye
 Astrobytes: ofc
 AntiSquid: precomputed array of rand numbers :p
 AntiSquid: or just use fastrand 
 Astrobytes: Prune Array works better
 Astrobytes: also try to #define RAND_MAX = x somewhere in your main code
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/fast-random-number-generator-on-the-intel-pentiumr-4-processor.html">https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/fast-random-number-generator-on-the-intel-pentiumr-4-processor.html</a>
 AntiSquid: i use that shit, seems popular
 AntiSquid: maybe there's something newer / better 
 Astrobytes: xorshift?
 AntiSquid: oops linked wrong article i guess :D
 Astrobytes: Was suggesting xorshift
 AntiSquid: no it is that one
 AntiSquid: ya
 struct: rand() is clearly superior /s
 Astrobytes: Especially when you don't seed it /s

 Astrobytes: yea, 64 bit xorshift
 Astrobytes: I use more or less the same
 JBM: mod n kills babies
 Astrobytes: I store the result and mod with the bounding number if required

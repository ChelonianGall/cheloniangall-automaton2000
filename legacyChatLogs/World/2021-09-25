 magus2: I think the 'X egg problem' is probably wrong from reading about the 2 egg problem on the internet.
 Husoski: magus2 What's wrong about it?  
 magus2: I'll look into it further, but a site indicated that a 100 floor 2 egg problem would be 14, where the 'x egg problem' indicated that a 50 floor 2 egg problem would take 14.  I'm sure that these two cases should have different results, so one of them is wrong.
 magus2: nevermind, seems to be fine.

 ash15khng: just join public clashes
 Justin-Truong: no
 Justin-Truong: I want to finish quest
 BlaiseEbuth: No quest require to do private clashs.
 BlaiseEbuth: ANd don't spam
 Justin-Truong: quest require private right?
 Justin-Truong: plz join me

 BlaiseEbuth: Stop
 Uljahn: private clashes do not count i think
 Justin-Truong: I count
 Justin-Truong: it
 Uljahn: for clash invites use #clash
 Justin-Truong: ok thanks
 DimitrisLamprinos: hey guys, how do i enable vim mode in the editor
 Uljahn: should be in the settings on the left side bar
 AntiSquid: oh the usual clash spam, no convos, what's up Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: is there a way to use my own even if i have a list of available moves
 ProCoder03: Hello everyone&#160;!!
 jacek: haooy Caturday
 el-musleh: Hi all, How I can check people answers after #ClashOfCode match for same question? 
 ash15khng: click view code next to their name at the clash complete page
 mrrobot-caretaker: hi what's up?
 mrrobot-caretaker: how i can join html
 mrrobot-caretaker: clash
 el-musleh: I can view other's code, but we are not solving the same game.
 M0H07ED: I think there should be enhancement in clash of code particularly in smallest code challenge which does not assume the different in syntax between programming languages (like there is a big difference between python and c)
 Westicles: CoC is the first exposure for many young folks here to how unjust and frightening the world can be.  Moderators are trained to help you through this crisis
 Arison: yo where could i report a error in one of the practice exercise?
 jacek: what error
 69razer69: lol
 Mentos24: lele
 Arison: already solved 
 armalitedev: ey
 struct: hi
 ErrorCookie: I want ot get the surrounding fields in a 2d array. I have working code in javascript for it but it'd be interesting to hear how you would go about that.
 ErrorCookie: When I try to do this I end up with tons of if chains because of the corner and edge cells in an array
 struct: is it similar to floodfill?
 struct: I guess you can do something like this ErrorCookie
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b59f743d-28cd-4047-9d2b-01571acb74c2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b59f743d-28cd-4047-9d2b-01571acb74c2</a>
 ErrorCookie: I'm a bit confused what exactly does this code do
 struct: it checks for each direction
 struct: up, down, right, left
 struct: its not the entire code
 struct: just a part of it
 ErrorCookie: how can I send pastebins like you did before?
 struct: just paste it here
 ErrorCookie: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/75180622-ddce-4b0c-b445-69b03204b03b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/75180622-ddce-4b0c-b445-69b03204b03b</a>
 ErrorCookie: This is what I did when I did a game of life challenge
 ErrorCookie: It performs an action on every 8 cells surrounding a cell
 ErrorCookie: But with this I have 4 nested loops
 ErrorCookie: I wouldnt call it performant
 struct: if you have a 2d array with each direction possible
 struct: like I have in my code
 struct: but on my code is only 4 directions
 ErrorCookie: Your code uses an array with array[4][2] 
 raizbro: hi
 struct: yes 2d array
 raizbro: that no good who kik me
 ErrorCookie: but 4 2 has a width or height of 2
 raizbro: oh
 ErrorCookie: so you can either go left or right but not both
 ErrorCookie: from the current cell
 raizbro: i knoo the anwser
 ErrorCookie: enlighten us .(^_^).
 raizbro: no
 ErrorCookie: :O
 Astrobytes: you again
 struct: 4 directions with x and y change
 struct: so 1st direction is right
 struct: because x increases by 1 and y doesnt increase
 ErrorCookie: Yes I just understood dirs means possible directions I thought dirs was the array you perform the surrounding search on
 struct: because its 0
 ErrorCookie: whoops
 struct: it allows you to check all the surrounding cells of the cell you are currently checking
 ErrorCookie: Now I understand it it's pretty simple xD
 ErrorCookie: Thank you!

 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: UwU
 struct: I think the minimax is working now
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf:&#160;????
 jacek: struct do you find 1st player has some advantage?
 struct: minmax Wontonimo
 struct: no idea jacek my bot is not good enough
 struct: black seems to have an advantage
 struct: from the paper
 Wontonimo: minmax is just so much more code though.  For Tron, I started with negamax. It worked great for 4 players, because each player just tried to maximize their move.  There was no "nega" but instead a point-of-view-max, which for 2 players is just nega-max
 Wontonimo: povmax - I'm trademarking it
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: that's MaxN isn't it?
 Wontonimo: do you have a link for maxN&#160;?  maybe, I haven't heard about that
 struct: Now I need to figure out transposition tables
 Astrobytes: kinda busy rn, but google should throw up a fair number of papers iirc
 saberscientist: hi

 jacek:  
 struct: finally i won a game vs ludii
 jacek: manually?
 struct: my bot beat it
 BlaiseEbuth: I can solve complex equations in less than 1 sec.My pc can.
 struct: well if you are the one who wrote it you are still the one who solved it
 BlaiseEbuth: Bot slavery! Intelectual property theft!
 BlaiseEbuth: Automaton2000 riot!
 Automaton2000: so i gave up on it
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: struct which game are you working on?
 struct: lines of action
 struct: darkhorse ported it
 MSmits: ohhh cool, is it released or stil wip?
 struct: wip
 MSmits: and how do you fight against ludii?
 jacek: badly
 MSmits: i meant the descriptive how, not the qualitative how :P
 struct: i just did it manually
 struct: I think its possible to connect the bot though
 MSmits: oh ok
 struct: But I would need to create a java file to connect to the c++ process
 struct: But lines of action ai is not very strong there
 struct: They only check for mid control
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: How is everyone today
 MSmits: good, quiet day, doing a bit of work
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: fun
 struct: have you finished your yavalath bot MSmits?
 MSmits: yeah it's working, but I am redoing the book
 MSmits: going to be better than before. Hopefully more robust
 MSmits: so no NN's can come in and beat me with the same game over and over&#160;:)
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: I am also still hoping to solve another move beyond the center 7. Not sure it's possible but would be cool
 jacek: reaching for turing award eh
 MSmits: if there was ever a good achievement for receiving that it would be solving a yavalath starting move :P
 struct: what would you do to avoid same game?
 MSmits: eh, i would just win them :P
 struct: have multiple replies to the  same position?
 MSmits: other than that, not much i can do
 MSmits: I am locally running the meta mcts with room for 100k moves in the bot. I am just hoping that it's enough to skip all traps and poor early moves and just win every game&#160;:)
 MSmits: bot is better, but not better than a NN obviously
 MSmits: so far just 700 moves in the new book, old bot had like 2k
 struct: still far from 100k
 MSmits: yeah, so i am mostly limited by local calc time
 MSmits: I also just like the idea of, at some point, using all those solved gamestates and training a NN with supervised
 MSmits: the longer i leave it running, the more of those i have
 MSmits: but mostly, I am just busy with work, so this is just a quick diversion from it, every once in a while. Checking how the meta mcts is doing, it's relaxing
 jacek: now we need your meta mcts power to determine the loa 1st player advantage
 MSmits: mmh is there no literature about this?
 MSmits: this is a famous game isnt it?
 jacek: struct says black player has some advantage
 MSmits: black is 1st?
 MSmits: best thing you can do is check the tournament rules
 MSmits: if they implement pie rule or some such, it can be put in our version as well
 jacek: could be its negligible, like in chess. you dont see pie rule in chess eh
 MSmits: nope, but loa seems simpler. The simpler a game, the more problematic it usually is when one side has an advantage
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/Analysis%20and%20Implementation.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/Analysis%20and%20Implementation.pdf</a>
 jacek: hmm has some tips on move generation
 MSmits: nice!
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: try to read page 8
 MSmits: btw this is a special document because this is Winands master thesis
 jacek: hopefully it doesnt have pseudo code
 MSmits: hah
 MSmits: hopefully&#160;:)
 MSmits: he has good ideas though
 MSmits: 10^24 state space complexity is very small
 MSmits: comparable to uttt and checkers and such
 MSmits: and othello
 jacek: so, when do you solve it
 MSmits: too busy with Y&#160;:)
 MSmits: basically this game is only solvable if you can do some clever pruning. Like they did in checkers
 MSmits: checkers also had endgame db, this game doesnt, so probably too hard
 struct: it doenst have pseudo code no
 struct: im still trying to understand the move gen part
 MSmits: seems complicated to generate moves in this game
 struct: I feel like my way is too slow
 MSmits: you think every way is too slow&#160;:)
 struct: its hard to say when I have nothing to bench against
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: make up different ways to do it
 jacek: ludii :v
 jacek: or ask that guy for the MIA
 struct: yeah ludii that takes 1 sec for depth 5
 struct: guess mine is already 100x faster
 struct: I can optimize it but ill have the same problem
 struct: ill be stuck in the eval like always
 jacek: eval. is it some too peasant concept for me to understand?
 struct: are you already doing NN?
 jacek: not this one yet, and not soon
 jacek: i have other NN stuff to do
 struct: any cg game?
 jacek: not particular
 jacek: trying to improve my learning framework overall

 eulerscheZahl: what's wrong with bender?
 jacek: triggered
 eulerscheZahl: straight forward BFS. it was never intended to be hard to solve 100% correct&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but a lot of players seem to struggle with it
 jacek: its optim
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/community-puzzle-bender-episode-4/84756/26">https://forum.codingame.com/t/community-puzzle-bender-episode-4/84756/26</a>that's pretty much exactly my expected solution
 struct: ony 900k states, time to brute force it
 eulerscheZahl: that's what I did to generate the random maps as well
 eulerscheZahl: make sure that the solution is complex enough but existing
 eulerscheZahl: had to run it for maybe half an hour until i had enough testcases
 jacek: back to that xkcd, calvinball sounds perfect for muzero :v
 MSmits: bender is a great puzzle, no matter what you intended eulerscheZahl, it is exactly as hard as it should be
 MSmits: i enjoyed it a lot
 MSmits: even had a student that solved it. I told him the algorithm though, but he coded it himself
 MSmits: o it's late euler is asleep already&#160;:)

 flipped_a_bit: anybody know a case that would fail test #7 of the super computer puzzle but pass the other 8?
 Stilgart: do you use 64-bit integers&#160;?
 Uljahn: could be a timeout because of inefficient algorithm / data structures
 flipped_a_bit: I'm in rust, and using pointer-sized ints
 flipped_a_bit: (usually 64, but it depends on the host machine)
 Stilgart: (should be 64 on CG)
 flipped_a_bit: and I get a real error message, so its not a timeout: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/37367e26-c2d8-452a-a98a-f1d2e3981180">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/37367e26-c2d8-452a-a98a-f1d2e3981180</a>
 flipped_a_bit: that did my paste weird
 Uljahn: it's intended
 Stilgart: then, your code returns the wrong value
 flipped_a_bit: yeah, I can't find a shorter example that helps me narrow down the problem... i've scanned through the 99999 values, but there's only so much attention I can give to that many haha
 Uljahn: probably infamous off-by-one error or something similar, we can only guess
 Uljahn: btw have you read the discussion thread?
 MetaPerfect: hi everyone. Can we see debug information on failed validators after submitting a solution?I'm trying my luck at Binary Extension and am trying to understand/debug the weird failing behavior
 struct: I can give you the validator if you want
 struct: and then you can play it on ide
 MetaPerfect: that would be great!
 MetaPerfect: I just joined the Discord channel, in case it helps
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/43687cd854d10e38c3716e6d08efe735b42f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/43687cd854d10e38c3716e6d08efe735b42f</a>
 struct: press test in ide
 struct: you should have access to all validators
 MetaPerfect: ty 👍
 struct: np
 MetaPerfect: wow, "Four goals, bomb at center" is really hard to solve optimally with predicting those bombs
 struct: is iterative deepening on minimax basicly keep searching while you have time and increase depth, and then keep the best move of the highest depth completed?
 struct: like search minimax(1), minimax(2) ... until you have no time
 YurkovAS: Oo, i'm wined derjack with mcts 1 time :smile:
 struct: YurkovAS EPT?
 YurkovAS: 10 random moves and after ept
 YurkovAS: game updated: 150 max turns, 150ms
 struct: my current submit is also mcts
 struct: mcts with solver
 struct: ept depth 3
 struct: random moves too
 struct: getting moves is very expensive right?
 YurkovAS: with avx? :smile:
 YurkovAS: yes, very slow
 struct: no avx
 struct: i still have to improve eval
 struct: ill probably also use minimax instead of mcts
 struct: I tried avx on wincheck but it was slower
 struct: havent tried on getMoves
 SandmanSW96: hey,
 SandmanSW96: is there any way to get that giant black box to STOP popping up while i'm trying to code in the ide?
 Uljahn: you mean Language Assist?
 struct: also YurkovAS do you use solver?
 struct: my mcts can solve depth 3, but minimax seems to be doing way better in this case
 YurkovAS: struct yes, my also solve depth 2-3
 SandmanSW96: not the one that suggest code, the huge black rectangle that offers too friggin many suggestions every time yo type something other than punctionation.  the damn thing pops up and blocks half my code
 YurkovAS: minimax is hard for pro level usage: transposition table, zobrist, iter deeping with reuse previous statistics (moves order or only one best move)
 struct: depth 3 is 3 plys right?
 YurkovAS: 3 plays: my, op, my
 struct: ok so its similar
 YurkovAS: classic solver
 struct: still I dont feel like this is a mcts game
 struct: I read a paper that used it though
 struct: They recommended depth 3 EPT
 struct: But they probably have a very good eval
 YurkovAS: i'm like what i can test in ide vs previous best bot. for c4 it not worked...
 YurkovAS: in local pc IDE: similar to brutal tester
 struct: yeah
 struct: I never tested connect 4 locally 
 struct: Due to that reason
 struct: I tested breakthrough but I had to test it vs multiple versions
 Astrobytes: I strongly believe this is a minimax game, but with what Yurkov said (and I said before)
 Astrobytes: I am happy to be proven wrong.
 struct: also transposition tables will help a lot here
 struct: I never tried to add transposition tables on the rollout
 struct: dont even know if its a thing
 Astrobytes: I never used TT with MCTS
 Astrobytes: It is but it's a bit different to the alphabeta version
 struct: ill try to learn it
 struct: for minimax
 struct: I found this code which seems decent enough to guide me
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/AdamStelmaszczyk/gtsa/blob/master/cpp/gtsa.hpp#L372">https://github.com/AdamStelmaszczyk/gtsa/blob/master/cpp/gtsa.hpp#L372</a>
 Astrobytes: OK for minimax (I usually say alphabeta because straight minimax is useless)
 Astrobytes: Iterative deepening
 Astrobytes: Order moves at each depth in that loop to prioritise the best one from the last depth
 Astrobytes: You can also order moves with a quick eval
 Astrobytes: (Apply, eval, score, undo)
 Astrobytes: Forget all the other stuff until you get that all working smoothly
 struct: So I should store the moves from previous depths
 struct: makes sense 
 Astrobytes: Sure. You can keep the best moves, score the moves, keep the principal variation, etc etc. chessprogrammingwiki thingy is your friend for a bunch of this stuff
 struct: my Tic Tac Toe will become unstoppable 
 struct: oh I see that tric trac also joined the game
 mr.bossman: heh i just relised im rank 807 in oc

 Justin-Truong: wow in codingame some testcase is hard to understadn
 mr.bossman: yup
 Justin-Truong: like reverse
 mr.bossman: yeah some are realy dumb

 saberscientist: 95% of the time you get beaten by people who have already seen the problem
 Justin-Truong: yeah
 Justin-Truong: when you try the coc alot
 Justin-Truong: many problem will comeback

 H2u: Hi. Can you guys please help me with this problem? we have 1 + 40/60 + 35/3600 = 1.676388889But in java, when I print that calculus, it is 1
 H2u: Do you guys have any ideas why it has a result like that?
 Wontonimo: yes
 Wontonimo: 40/60 = 0
 Wontonimo: 40.0/60.0 is what you want
 Wontonimo: same with 35/3600
 H2u: oh you right :grin: Thank you so much!
 Wontonimo: good question for that ...
 Wontonimo: H2u :taco:
 H2u: I didn't realize that
 antiwonto: [automated] Wontonimo has awarded H2u 10 tacos. H2u now has 10 tacos. Wontonimo now has 56 tacos
 Wontonimo: hi antiwonto
 antiwonto: [automated] hey Wontonimo. I'm a bot :robot:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: ThomasNicoullaud :taco:
 H2u: :taco:
 Wontonimo: hmm, is that a user Gloria?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: yeah, a mod
 Wontonimo: must not have logged on recently (last 4 days)
 Wontonimo: antiwonto only knows about people who show up on world chat
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Wontonimo :taco:
 Wontonimo: H2u , you've gotta say the user name and a :taco:
 antiwonto: [automated] Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker has awarded Wontonimo 10 tacos. Wontonimo now has 66 tacos. Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker now has 17 tacos
 Wontonimo: :grin:
 H2u: Wontonimo :beers:
 Wontonimo: only tacos
 H2u: oh only tacos :sweat_smile:
 H2u: Wontonimo :taco:
 antiwonto: [automated] H2u has awarded Wontonimo 10 tacos. Wontonimo now has 76 tacos. H2u now has 11 tacos
 Wontonimo: I have so many tacos!  all according to my plans for world domination

 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: spam submit?
 Wontonimo: it's asking me if i'm a robot... time to optimize the code.
 Wontonimo: also, there is a couple bugs because it is using the 'try something random' when it can't find a move and i can see obvious ones
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I though I remembered mine winning around 1/6, but it seems worse now
 Wontonimo: oh, lucky submit!

 Wontonimo: what do i win?
 TimberStalker: Got a successful testcase for minesweeper
 TimberStalker: time to spam submit
 Wontonimo: that was a submit!
 Wontonimo: i'm golden now
 TimberStalker: i submitted to many times
 TimberStalker: it got mad
 Wontonimo: well, wood league
 Wontonimo: i need to fix a few bugs, and improve the performance if I want to call it a gold level bot.  but since this is a puzzle
 TimberStalker: It worked lets go
 TimberStalker: Time to look at solutions of people who actually know what they are doing.
 Wontonimo: give McLovin :taco:
 Wontonimo:&#160;;(
 Wontonimo: Mclovin :taco:
 Wontonimo: good job TimberStalker&#160;!
 Wontonimo: how did you do it?
 TimberStalker: Do you want explain it? 
 TimberStalker: Would kinda ruin the challenge for others.
 Wontonimo: yeah, summary
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: just concept
 Wontonimo: mine is based off of WFC.  It uses the same concept of constraint collapsing 
 Wontonimo: using 5x5 patches
 Wontonimo: brute force
 Wontonimo: how about you?
 TimberStalker: I just look at a found cell and check its neighbors
 Wontonimo: check it's neighbours recursively?
 TimberStalker: nope
 TimberStalker: just check the neighbours
 Wontonimo: that's it?  just 1 ply
 TimberStalker: if i dont find anything, go to the next node in the queue
 Wontonimo: and does your algo ever guess?
 TimberStalker: If it fails the direct neighbors, itl do an algorithm per neighbor to see if i can flag or reveal a nearby node. Other than that, itl pick randomly if it goes through every cell on the map and cant reveal anything
 TimberStalker: Cant you check out my code directly?
 TimberStalker: oh it only shows languages youve solved the puzzle with
 TimberStalker: i guess that makes sense
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: TimberStalker did you publish?  It isn't showing up yet
 TimberStalker: Its in c# so if you didnt write it in that i dont think you can see it.
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I can see c#
 TimberStalker: why cant i see any other languages?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I mean I solved it in c#
 TimberStalker: I dont see your name either
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I only published in c++.  Anyhow, you might double check you published
 TimberStalker: I see my name under my solutions
 TimberStalker: When i click on it, it says published
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: ah, now it shows
 TimberStalker: cool
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: yours won 3/20 when I tried it, similar to mine
 TimberStalker: ya, its not exactly efficient
 TimberStalker: it heavily relies on a few random choices being correct
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: yeah, I start with 3 clicks
 TimberStalker: Interesting. i only do one, and guess when the program cant find anything
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: having 3 separated clumps to start made it easier for mine to solve (for some reason)
 TimberStalker: It reveals more and it frontloads the guessing so you can restart faster is my best guess
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: yeah, the solver isn't very good so needs a large pool of cells to try
 TimberStalker: Honestly though, i didnt even expect to make a functional ai, much less one that works even 5% of the time
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I was going to run them all 100 times to see how they compare, but there are over 70 now
 RaymondPang: hello everyone, i got stuck on my code vs zombies coding
 RaymondPang: i passed all the Test cases, but when I submitted, it has one test case failed
 RaymondPang: how can i debug that test case?
 RaymondPang: 19 failed test caseSplit-second reflex
 Uljahn: submission tests are called validators, you can't debug them unless it's a community puzzle
 MrZee: So I started on a Udemy course for pathfinding/algorithms, but does anyone have some other good suggestions for pathfinding/algorithm courses/study materials?

 AlkhilJohn.: I was being a little irritating
 AlkhilJohn.: 5DN1L, Uljahn may I please be unbanned from the discord?
 BBC-sasa: Ye Logic when you are gay, you are morue irritating. So you can gent bannes from à discord, it’s same for me&#160;!

 MrZee: What is going on tonight? Issues in chat left and right it seems. I haven't been on here long, but I've never seen it get like this, is this uncommon?
 One-Six: in other news, my approach of "if there's no easy safe choices then just wing it" for minesweeper seems to guarantee failure XD
 One-Six: Or perhaps when it worked, I didn't notice 'cause it's not obvious...
 MrZee: Jokes on them, that's how I normally play Minesweeper lol
 One-Six: XDD
 One-Six: Next thing I need to somehow incorporate is deducing mine positions from two numbers
 One-Six: which is, um, hard to code

 JeVaisDurcir: ban it translate what did he say
 JeVaisDurcir: in french
 MrZee: Mods are bringing the thunder tonight
 One-Six: Yeah, I guess the next dumb thing to try is to try a 3x3 with the highest (unknown):(mines left) ratio...
 One-Six: Right now my "wing it" strategy is simply randomly pick one square that is described by "known mines–total mines==1"
 EvilLongcoatVonKirschenwald_c12b: girl stfu dumb ass bitch

 One-Six: man, what a spicy late night
 Merci_a_jerren_ttre_dandu_dousan: He EvilLongcoatVonKirshenWald, t’es homo

 One-Six: thanks for your hard work round here, 5DN1L
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 MrZee: Troll(s) are trying real hard tonight for some reason. Not sure what they get out of it. Literally hundreds of thousands of other online chats they can lurk instead.
 MrZee: Yeah, thanks 5DN1L!
 5DN1L: maybe they're lurking hundreds of thousands of other online chats too :shrug:
 5DN1L: you're welcome&#160;:)
 TruKiKod: (they're also trolling french chat)
 One-Six: oh yeah, I got two  "no safe action" in a row, so I guess that's a minor improvement? Xd
 One-Six: as in, I survived the first blind step
 One-Six: Alright, good day and good night to all y'all
 5DN1L: good night!
 One-Six: (why did i say "all y'all" LOL)
 5DN1L: because you're getting sleepy lol

 Automaton2000: if you have a good score
 Astrobytes: Automaton2000 :taco:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: a shame to spend time on that when "we will most likely delete this chat in favor of Discord in the "
 Automaton2000: is there a quick way to get to a leaf
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: "in the coming weeks"
 Wontonimo: oh, interesting ... your message wasn't received Astrobytes because of this #taco
 Wontonimo: antiwonto decided to instead give you your daily taco instead of processing your gift
 ninjadip: ohh
 Wontonimo: it's only allowed to give 1 response per message receieved
 Astrobytes: interesting

 eulerscheZahl: with 5% to 80% corruption rate depending on testcase
 eulerscheZahl: mine can solve seed 2 with C=0.4, bugs out at 0.5 at the moment
 eulerscheZahl: and i want more CPU time

 Wontonimo: hey eulerscheZahl, i had a lot of fun making a minesweeper bot.  Thanks!
 eulerscheZahl: glad to hear. was challenging to create the game
 eulerscheZahl: mostly that useless clock showing the real time, that's like 50% of the overall time :D
 Wontonimo: wow
 Wontonimo: details!  it makes a huge difference
 Astrobytes: Attention to detail goes a long way wrt to user engagement
 Astrobytes: Apparently :P
 struct: I would try, but I do very poorly on this types of challenges, thanks for sharing though
 eulerscheZahl: it's mostly math/statistics this time. I like it
 Astrobytes: It's a nice change from the usual
 Astrobytes: even if Illeda n wanted easy points :D
 eulerscheZahl: they had another statistics contest a while ago: you were given a leaderboard (teams with points and goals scores+received) and had to reconstruct the results of each individual pairing
 Astrobytes: I think I remember you mentioning that 
 Wontonimo: if anyone knows of something like cg world chat, let me know.
 Astrobytes: use irc [solved]
 Wontonimo: good point
 ninjadip: that's an icon that could go on that minesweeper desktop, mIRC, man that was the irc client
 RajdeepBiswas: Q: For contributions (to CoC), what is the difference between a test case and a validator set?
 RajdeepBiswas: validator case*
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: usenet groups!
 struct: RajdeepBiswas validators are hidden
 ninjadip: make them a little different so people can't hardcode the answers
 Astrobytes: RajdeepBiswas: also the validators should cover the test case equivalents but using different input. i.e. they should not be identical
 5DN1L: Please also read the guidelines here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/contribution-guidelines">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/contribution-guidelines</a>
 RajdeepBiswas: Got it, thanks!
 Astrobytes: 5DN1L, Wontonimo - I think the wording here could be changed to be a little less... ambiguous? 'The main goal of a CoC battle is to be short (except in the "Shortest" mode). '
 ninjadip: lol
 Astrobytes: I mean I know what they mean but...
 Astrobytes: Perhaps 'easy to solve quickly' or similar may be a reasonable substitute
 5DN1L: agreed
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: why are you telling them, lol?
 Astrobytes: It's my inherent good nature and kindness :D
 ninjadip: ..is to be solved in a short period of time.   --would be best
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: so when they change to discord, will it still run down the side of the screen?
 Astrobytes: muahaha, I think not
 ninjadip: where will it run then
 struct: Not sure if you can embed discord
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: and it will be difficult to tell who you are talking to since the names are all different
 Astrobytes: there's probably some API you can use to at least show updates but I don't think there's any direct way to embed fully
 Astrobytes: And that would be extra work anyway, when the idea is to have less workload by removing webchat
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: workload?  I'd like to see that argument, what workload?
 struct: I doubt chat has any relevant cost
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I don't see any evidence of non-volunteer interaction
 Astrobytes: Hey I'm only repeating 
 Astrobytes: It's not my personal viewpoint!
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: oh, I know :P
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I suppose we could pick a youtube video and just post underneath it
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: as long as it's not jacek choosing the videos we'll be fine

 Tocsmon: ahh ok
 Tocsmon: optimisng corners
 Tocsmon: how would I make it priotise the main one it's going to tho?
 struct: well you will still aim towards the main one
 struct: but when you get close enough you decide to start aiming towards the next one
 Tocsmon: how close is "close enough"?
 struct: maybe 2 checkpoints radius away
 Tocsmon: ok
 struct: I never tried this way
 Tocsmon: thanks very much

 eulerscheZahl: MadKnight 05:21PMeulerscheZahl&#160;?quick question
 eulerscheZahl: go ahead
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl how do they read mouse input in 3d games? i mean some games seem to check for cursor movement, and some games kinda use raw mouse input data directly
 MadKnight: i have mouse acceleration feature in windows that makes my cursor go faster if i move my mouse faster
 MadKnight: and it directly affects camera control in most of the 3d games
 eulerscheZahl: no idea, never did anything in that regard
 MadKnight: do u at least know what's mouse acceleration&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i've heard the word before
 MadKnight: i mean did u understand my explanation&#160;?
 MadKnight: are u on windows now&#160;?
 MadKnight: just try a checkbox in Mouse settings and check it out
 eulerscheZahl: i'm never on windows when I can avoid it
 eulerscheZahl: and now i can avoid it. only windows during office hours for me
 MadKnight: it basically makes it so that cursor movement isn't linearly related to mouse movement
 TimberStalker: MadKnight, Im pretty sure they just sample the mouse position on every frame.
 eulerscheZahl: that's what I assumed
 MadKnight: if u move your mouse the same distance but faster, your cursor goes a longer distance
 eulerscheZahl: guess what: that's not even windows-specific
 MadKnight: it's simple
 MadKnight: why is it not&#160;?
 MadKnight: TimberStalker it's a camera rotation, how would they do that if your cursor is on the edge of the screen&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: now you made me push my mouse around to test. looks linear on my machine
 MadKnight: are u on linux&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: ubuntu
 Tee-Resa: there are many games, as well as variants to read mouse input. the most common is probably a vector with 2 -1 to 1 values. but there are certainly some that track the absolute movement of frame to frame
 MadKnight: it's just that i have the non-linear feature enabled and for some reason in some games it doesn't work 
 jacek: eulerscheZahl did you hear? theres going to be new futurama
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: yes. you pinged me and i just replied. good news everyone
 TimberStalker: Games can set the position of the cursor. The can reset the location of the mouse every frame. Unity can do that.
 TimberStalker: You can see it sometimes when the game doesent hide the mouse
 TimberStalker: it gets stuck in the center but jitters in the direction you move the mouse
 struct: maybe the engine you are using might have an option for this?
 struct: or are you creating your own 3d engine?
 MadKnight: it's unity
 MadKnight: what option does it have?
 MadKnight: i'd be glad if u told me
 TimberStalker: Think its called CursorLockMode
 MadKnight: why am i talking like this
 jacek: oO
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 how do i talk
 TimberStalker: put this in some start or awake function
 Automaton2000: i can do in the cg ide
 TimberStalker: Cursor.lockState = CursorLockMode.Locked
 MadKnight: struct i'm actually hacking
 MadKnight: decompiled a small game
 MadKnight: trying to change mouse control
 jacek: :scream:
 oxydowe: Hello chat! What does exactly means "Surrounding space missing for operator" from rubocop... in shortest mode clashes? :confused:
 5DN1L: oh that's some ruby thing?
 oxydowe: yes, I think it is a linter
 MadKnight: oxydowe u fixed it&#160;?
 MadKnight: oh that was a clash
 MadKnight: and u lost it
 MadKnight: oxydowe that error looked like your mistake
 Wontonimo: HEY HEY MadKnight&#160;!!!!
 MadKnight: hey Wontonimo how u been&#160;?
 MadKnight: what u up to&#160;?
 Wontonimo: great!  great to see you.  so sad it is only for a few weeks
 jacek: huh
 Wontonimo: i just finished a solution to minesweeper
 Wontonimo: a few weeks cuz this chat is gone
 oxydowe: no, I mean: it's great to have a ruby linter... but in shortest mode it's just funny it warns about missing spaces!&#160;:-)
 MadKnight: wow i got kicked from the mods hard
 MadKnight: even Wontonimo is a mod
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 gg
 Automaton2000: how do i enable the chat
 kovi: you cant, go to discord
 MadKnight: oxydowe well who cares about the warnings right?
 Wontonimo: MadKnight :taco:

 Wontonimo: sorry
 struct: a new toy for MadKnight
 MadKnight: Wontonimo u got a dark side already?
 MadKnight: good going
 oxydowe: right, maybe it's an hint you're doing fine lol
 eulerscheZahl: if it consolidates you MadKnight: you had a longer timespan to be a mod than me
 syedkamal: hello
 MadKnight: why are u not a mod eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: i asked to be let go
 Wontonimo: free 
 syedkamal: i would like to learn js
 eulerscheZahl: Dobby is freeee

 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl cmon u probably know the reasoning
 MadKnight: anyway
 MadKnight: why can't i see when the next contest is coming
 struct: End of april probably
 MadKnight: i did learn some info on AI stuff actually
 Wontonimo: like what?
 jacek: aplied ifology
 MadKnight: i mean
 MadKnight: ye, more ifs, but
 Unknown12312: hi
 MadKnight: it all lead to my previous problem
 Wontonimo: what was that?
 MadKnight: gotta separate the code in modules based on logic instead of using OOP
 Wontonimo: oops, went too for with oop
 MadKnight: u are doing classes with all the code related to this class put into this class
 MadKnight: when instead u gotta separate your code into modules based on the logic
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl what do u think of that&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the size of the code
 eulerscheZahl: i won't split a 100 lines file into 2 if it belongs together in logic
 MadKnight: i'll DM u an example
 eulerscheZahl: i hated those artificial examples at university. 10 lines of logic and tons of files
 eulerscheZahl: no, please don't
 eulerscheZahl: busy with topcoder
 MadKnight: it's a short one
 MadKnight: just 2 tiny classes
 eulerscheZahl: just 2 tiny "no"s
 MadKnight: okay i'll just say it here
 MadKnight: so imagine u got a GameObject class and a GameWorld class
 MadKnight: GameObject just has a position and that's all
 MadKnight: now u wanna create a custom World class inheriting the GameWorld class
 MadKnight: but u want this World class to have physics
 MadKnight: so u would need each GameObject inside of World to have a velocity property
 MadKnight: this is a module thing
 MadKnight: look, the problem is that the Physics module can't just declare an extra variable for GameObject objects inside of its GameWorld
 MadKnight: u would have to store this extra variable regardless
 MadKnight: that's actually why UE4 games are so heavy
 MadKnight: because GameObject has to store velocity even if physics is disabled
 MadKnight: i'm just talking about splitting stuff in your code differently, and not about writing a ton of extra code
 MadKnight: what are u supposed to do about this&#160;?
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl have u ever done swift&#160;?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 why is it daytime for everyone when it's evening here?
 Automaton2000: guys, i just started learning python
 MadKnight: gg Automaton2000 soon you're gonna beat Uljahn
 Automaton2000: it was the one who wants to see it
 jacek: oO
 MadKnight: jacek yes
 jacek: i know almost nothing about making games using engine
 MadKnight: it's noting fancy jacek u basically get a world editor for an empty game and u can also make scripts for objects and events
 struct: didnt you make paper soccer?
 jacek: isnt this component oriented vs oop?
 jacek: paper soccer is love. paper soccer is life
 MadKnight: like a map/world editor
 MadKnight: u throw objects on the map, u throw scripts on objects
 struct: The only thing i know is that rendering is a pin
 MadKnight: a pin?
 struct: pain
 MadKnight: why
 jacek: he hasnt expensive gpu, noob
 MadKnight: jacek can't u optimize great graphics for poor gpu? noob
 MadKnight: why is it pain struct
 struct: my graphics can handle dice duel, not bad
 jacek: see dice duel. its so optimized
 struct: thats because you use linux jacek
 jacek: im superior, yes
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i think i'm a ghost
 Automaton2000: automaton2000, do you know any other way to get started with
 jacek: meh, no recursive calling
 struct: webgl antialias mess it up and you get 100% gpu usage
 struct: MadKnight I dont have much experience with rendering, maybe thats the reason

 MadKnight: u get the matrices, u get the shaders, u get the sheets, and u render
 MadKnight: epz
 MadKnight: ezpz
 MadKnight: u actually gotta render multiple times and to multiple sheets struct

 jacek: huh
 jacek: i wonder if this is our oware
 jacek: and if i understand, its competition between their ai
 struct: but cant you play vs it?
 jacek: i think i can try
 struct: its not possible to beat it right?
 MadKnight: prove it
 Idk.-_-: hey guys can someone pls help me on setting up vs code&#160;?
 MadKnight: Idk.-_- let's go
 Idk.-_-: i have some problems
 jacek: -_-
 Quidome: If you manage to get a draw you are on par&#160;:)
 struct: drawing vs that bot is like drawing vs msmits on yavalath
 Quidome: did MSmith solve yavalath?
 struct: without pie rule ("Steal") it is solved
 jacek: he solver 7 center cells (without steal)
 struct: ^
 jacek: he has oware 36 seeds endgames
 jacek: so maybe he could beat that bot
 struct: but didnt that bot solved?
 struct: or only weakly solved?
 Rebollo: printF****Tree is my new function
 jacek: oware is solved to draw if not for 200 turns limit

 Quidome: looks good
 Quidome: but I am gonna stay focused, sorry for now
 struct: What are you working on Quidome?
 Quidome: Clobber
 Quidome: I keep writing those loops when I need to eliminate symmetry. Is there a smarter way?
 Rebollo: maybe recursion
 Quidome: Functional is nice for 1D but as soon it becomes 2d or more I can't get my head around it
 struct: you mean rotate the board and such?
 Zketra: im a minor can i still get the pcep certificate?
 Rebollo: :joy:
 Quidome: rotation mirroing indeed
 struct: are you using bitboards?
 Quidome: If you have 8 symmetries on a square board ih have 7 symmetry functions with each a nested loop over x and y
 Quidome: no i do not use bitboards

 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Irredentism is popular with the kids these days

 struct: the pass thing makes things messy
 Astrobytes: don't you have an othello mcts bot?
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: oh, it's an alphabeta?
 struct: I dont have an othello bot
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Ah
 Astrobytes: That would explain that then.
 struct: i dont have a bot for any of the games I ported I think
 Astrobytes: you should get around to that
 Astrobytes: most are good for mcts of some flavour or another 
 struct: I should just have made an empty node for pass
 Tiramon: damn my minesweeper submit always ends with 2 field and 50:50 chance ...
 Unknown12312: What speed mean in Mean Max (vx and vy) I dont understand it after log all the data out.
 struct: but now a node can have childs where it has both p1 and p2...
 Astrobytes: struct: did you ask darkhorse what he did for his one?
 Astrobytes: for the pass moves
 Astrobytes: Hi Tiramon
 Scarfield: my move part of the node i just 0ULL, either my boards doesnt change with a zero val move, or now i just return out of the sim function if node.move == 0
 darkhorse64: I reset the tree
 struct: ah wait what im drawing doesnt even make sense
 struct: a node cant have children of both players
 struct: that is just impossible
 Scarfield: promiscuous node
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: oO
 Tiramon: wait i hardcode the start cell and submit replay shows me another starting location ... what is wron with minesweeper submit?
 Tiramon: oh damn thats just a default replay that has nothing to do with my code ...
 struct: maybe the seed was different?
 Scarfield: btw im not really using pass nodes anymore. if the game reaches a point where a player has to pass, i count the pieces of both players, and add the free cells to the moving player, and determine the winner from that. there is a chance the moving player will lose, and might win by jumping and letting the opponent in the game again, but i assume its unlikely enough that i just count at that point
 struct: I do that
 struct: but only if im sure its a win
 struct: but is not on my submit yet
 struct: My old submit was evaling the wrong state :p
 jacek: oh my
 struct: do you use rollout Scarfield?
 struct: im using EPT(0) atm
 Scarfield: yes, but am changing into EPT
 Astrobytes: wtf is that Buzzle that was just approved, what a mess
 Scarfield: rewrote my mcts, its so much cleaner than my previous ones&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: correction: I reset the tree when the opponent has played multiple moves. Pass is a node on the tree so that I can keep alternating black and white
 Scarfield: avg about 45k full rollouts the first 100ms turns, how about you?
 struct: I dont do rollouts
 Scarfield: i know, but im still interested in your smcount :P times backpropagating or however you count it?
 struct: 15M nodes evaluated nodes on first turn
 jacek: w00t
 struct: wait let me be sure
 struct: 1.520506e+07
 struct: its 15M right?
 Scarfield: i have about the same for expanded nodes, not sure if thats comparable
 jacek: who counts the full numbers in floats ;f
 Scarfield: uint32 :muscle:
 struct: its the number of visits that the root has
 struct: which is almost equal to the evals
 Scarfield: :o
 struct: but my eval is 1 line
 struct: But this code is probably bugy
 struct: do you check for 3fold repetiton Scarfield?
 Scarfield: i have about 700k root visits turn 1, but i just started converting to ept, and there surely are bugs, hopefully can boost the numbers
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: lol no forgot
 Scarfield: decided to wait to see if you would make it 1fold or 3fold, but then just forgot about it
 jacek: so im nuts for not having pass moves?
 struct: no, its probably rare where player with less spaces can make a comeback
 jacek: i mean, in negamax when you normally have -negamax(-color,-beta,-alpha) i have
 jacek: if child is my color negamax(color,alpha,beta)else -negamax(-color,-beta,-alpha)
 jacek: similarly in mcts/jacekmax, i have player in node and backpropagate accordingl
 jacek: essentially its the same as having pass node
 struct: yeah I have player on the node now
 struct: I also have next player, not sure if its needed but im using it
 struct: maybe there is a way to code without it
 jacek: 1st draw :tada:
 struct: where?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/xzj9ft">https://streamable.com/xzj9ft</a>
 struct: nice

 struct: or my code will break

 ninjadip: i'm feel even more proud not reading any algos on it, just writing my own dynamic thing from a human strategy guide
 ninjadip: this was my first featured event 
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 Wontonimo: i've tried encoding human strategy many times and it always feels so overly complex and brittle.  maybe there's a trick to it, but I haven't cracked it
 ninjadip: now let's see if i can get this best path validator in don't panic 2... ugh
 ninjadip: think logic write logic
 jacek: just write NN for it
 Wontonimo: yeah... i hear ya, but in practice it turns into a bit pile of steaming stuff on me
 ninjadip: yeah that's where i left off, having to start that
 Unknown12312: anyone want to join my escapr room game
 ninjadip: what is that again?
 ninjadip: i've never done that

 okon1230: hi
 okon1230: wassup?
 struct: hi
 Wontonimo: i think ninjadip is now dead.  lured into a dark room by Unknown12312
 struct: o.o
 struct: ok I think my bot can finally detect 3 move repetition
 struct: had a bug where I kept exploring the tree even if root was solved which was destroying my entire tree
 Wontonimo: yikes
 struct: the repetition checker only cost around 10% of performance
 struct: not bad I think
 Wontonimo: that seems large though
 struct: you think?
 Wontonimo: idk, i don't have one implemented
 Wontonimo: but you need it right?  so, 10% isn't a bad cost
 struct: I can ignore it
 struct: but I need it to solve some draws if I want it to be perfect
 struct: obviously
 Wontonimo: obviously
 struct: The funny thing is that the mcts can still find the draw
 struct: but it doesnt know its a draw
 struct: it will just keep expanding
 struct: and the selection will pick the one that will lead to the draw
 struct: if that makes sense
 Wontonimo: yeah, i never have implemented a draw solver for mcts
 struct: I have for most of the games but I dont think its right
 Wontonimo: if i separate the 'solved' flag from my signal, then it should be straight forward.  currently i just piggyback on signal and use +-infi
 struct: also it was tricky to make the mcts with passes
 Wontonimo: 24+1 bytes shouldn't make a cache management difference
 struct: yku
 struct: *
 struct: your flag its outside the node?
 struct: pressed enter instead of backspace
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: somebody read the Buzzle statement and distill it down to a few lines
 Wontonimo:  /kick structstruct, you have been put in time out for spamming.  feel free to rejoin in 5 min
 struct: was a bit hard to read it
 struct: tbf
 Wontonimo: lol
 struct: I think I read 2 lines
 Wontonimo: Buzzle is a funny little math game about multiples.
 struct: But I can understand my English is not great either
 Wontonimo: it's like fizzbuzz 
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I warned the #fr they should reject it and they said 1) If you hate it we like it, and 2) free xp coming
 struct: lol
 Wontonimo: you know something, having minesweeper as an event with an artificial end date actually got me to dive in and give it more focus
 Wontonimo: that's not going to happen for clash though
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: lots of people solved it.  it seems from the email that people who haven't solved it can now vote on solutions?
 Wontonimo: yeah, i was able to vote on solutions before solving it
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: how did it know which language to show you?
 Wontonimo: i didn't want to spoil it for myself, so i just skimmed for coding style, layout, and if it actually got very much solved
 Wontonimo: it showed me js.  I did submit a random bot near the beginning of the event, so maybe that's what it used
 struct: I cant vote o.o
 struct: But I havent solved it
 Wontonimo: why?
 Wontonimo: oh
 struct: must be what you described
 Wontonimo: not a lot of javascript solutions.  11 in fact.
 Wontonimo: 6 within the last month.
 struct: puzzle is not that easy tbf
 struct: Medium might be missleading
 Wontonimo: i spent about 16 hours on it
 struct: Today I opened an "Hard" puzzle that should probably be a clash
 Wontonimo: link plz
 Wontonimo: i'll take a freebee
 Wontonimo: or be humbled and tell you you've got skilz i don't

 Wontonimo: ah, you have a c4 bot already
 struct: still
 struct: its not harder than minesweeper
 struct: but this probably is one of the first puzzles of cg
 Wontonimo: yeah, pretty straight forward for real
 Wontonimo: time to walk the dog
 Wontonimo: ttyl
 struct: cya
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: lots of 60-70 line python solutions, and 57 in haskell
 struct: who solved in haskel?
 struct: jbm?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: jbm
 Justix: jbm
 struct: fml
 struct: wasted half an hour on this
 struct: parent-&gt;status == 1; // It remains a lose
 struct: ...
 struct: should be only an =
 Wontonimo: wow Gloria, you already have 18 tacos!  :taco:
 Wontonimo: #taco
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: wow!
 Wontonimo: don't spend them all in one place
 One-Six: dang it, last two mines xd<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/607921707">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/607921707</a>
 Wontonimo: yikes
 Wontonimo: that wasn't fair
 Wontonimo: for your effort&#160;:
 One-Six: That particular one is a unlucky one, true
 antiwonto: [automated] Wontonimo has awarded One-Six 10 #taco. One-Six now has 11 taco. Wontonimo now has 78 taco
 One-Six: wait, how does tacos work?
 Wontonimo: say a user name and use the&#160;: taco&#160;: emoji
 One-Six: ah
 Wontonimo: only once a day per person
 Wontonimo: you got my daily taco, feel the specialness
 One-Six: OK! Thanks a lot for the taco!
 Wontonimo: also, if someone asks a dumb question that they could have googled you can use the lmgtfy features
 struct: unlucky on that replay
 Wontonimo: lmgtfy One-Six how to use emojis
 antiwonto: [automated] hey One-Six let me google that for you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+to+use+emojis">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+to+use+emojis</a>
 One-Six: I got one lucky one last night, but my current strategy is prone to explodiness
 One-Six: That's a nice bot
 Wontonimo: what's your win/loss rate?  I'm averaging about 1/5 now.
 Wontonimo: 1 win per 5 submits
 struct: But that one was solvable I think
 One-Six: I haven't keep track, but if I count that unlucky one I've got two near wins in at least 20 tests
 Wontonimo: no, i don't think so
 struct: maybe not
 One-Six: Yeah, there are always possible nondeterministic cases in minesweeper
 One-Six: but you could do very well...
 Wontonimo: in results history it tells you the total submits
 One-Six: Oh, I've been playing only testcases, no submits...
 Wontonimo: ah
 struct: it was possible yes
 One-Six: I want to try to add one more thing that takes two numbers into account
 struct: but you need to combine the 4 bottom numbers to get it
 struct: not easy
 One-Six: I am trying to think how that will work xd
 Wontonimo: OH you are right struct!
 struct: if you didnt do it the right way one of the numbers would not match
 One-Six: Ah
 Wontonimo: here is the area in questionF 1 1 2 3 22 3 2 3 F F?&#160;?&#160;?&#160;? F 4
 struct: where you clicked after that it was impossible for the 2 to have two
 struct: because then the three would overflow and have 4
 struct: the three at the right
 One-Six: indeed
 One-Six: so that is workable with only the 2 and the 3
 One-Six: so yeah, tonight I gotta make my two-number algorithm XD
 struct: in this case it was but not always
 struct: But I dont play minesweeper
 One-Six: The hard part is how to pick candidates
 One-Six: right now I am keeping track of all number squares that have any uncertainties; perhaps I can try to use adjacent uncertain #'s.
 struct: some people are crazy fast at solving minesweeper its impressive
 One-Six: Which, hopefully, won't be a lot
 struct: I guess its mostly pattern recognition
 One-Six: yeah
 Wontonimo: i made a write up of how i do it, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/community-puzzle-minesweeper/186994/36">https://forum.codingame.com/t/community-puzzle-minesweeper/186994/36</a>
 struct: nice
 struct: too bad I dont enjoy puzzles too much
 struct: oh good thing I scrolled through my code
 struct: I made the same mistake twice :D
 struct: my = key must be stuck
 Wontonimo: Here is how it would work in the situation you had One-Six
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/edaeb1c3-33f8-4a7c-a625-f24a0e669bfe">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/edaeb1c3-33f8-4a7c-a625-f24a0e669bfe</a>
 struct: broken
 Wontonimo: what's broken?
 One-Six: Wontonimo, are you just borrowing the quantum theory term, or is there some connection/usage in the CS field?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse">https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse</a>
 One-Six: oh, i found some CS usage, guess some people borrowed it first
 struct: paste bin is broken
 Wontonimo: yeah, this guy borrowed the term to make a tile solver
 Wontonimo: and i adapted it to a puzzle here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/wave-function-collapse-sans-shannon">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/wave-function-collapse-sans-shannon</a>
 One-Six: cool...
 Wontonimo: :grin: THANKS&#160;!  I'm super proud of that contributiion
 One-Six: yeah, that pastebin above is broken
 Wontonimo:&#160;:(
 One-Six: yeah, your puzzle is something i shall try

 Wontonimo: that should work better for you One-Six
 One-Six: i guess I can use the WFC principle on my special-case scenario solver
 One-Six: right now I basically have a dumb solver that look at 9 squares at one time
 One-Six: Wontonimo, yep that works
 Wontonimo: if you do go down the route, I had to add in logic so that it didn't try to compute till the heat death of the universie
 Wontonimo: like, don't try and solve an area if there are more than 9 unknown squares
 Wontonimo: for a 3x3, i use 6 unknown squares
 One-Six: I will just use it when the dumb solver doesn't work; and I will pass it a 4x4 gridlet only
 One-Six: so that should work
 One-Six: ah, I see
 Wontonimo: i use 3x3, then 5x3, then 3x5, then a 5x5 if all else fails
 One-Six: I see
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I can't really tell what my code is doing.  It is just fors and ifs
 Wontonimo: do you write unit tests for it Gloria?
 Wontonimo: feels so weird to call you Gloria Wes
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I don't know what a unit test is
 One-Six: my dumb solver's main stage does only these:1. if marked=number: click all unmarked2. unmarked+marked=number: mark all3. if above fails, calculate Unknown:(number-marked) ratio; remember highest UMR as dangerous candidate
 Wontonimo: but I feel like I'm betraying your secret identity to not call you Gloria.  difficult times
 One-Six: which, is how I personally play XD
 Wontonimo: :star:
 One-Six: so it would be looking at all numbered stages that haven't have all its mine found, and look at the 3x3 around it
 Wontonimo: i'm sure you are joking Wes
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: oh, well I only have three functions.  make_move, do_flags, and do_flags1
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: the last two are shrouded in mystery, I did this one a long time ago
 One-Six: ah
 One-Six: I hope mine will be slightly more legible in a year...
 ninjadip: whats poppin
 One-Six: Lua tends to get really spaghetti-y when stuff gets complicated though
 One-Six: also I haven't decided what to do with old debug lines, they get mixed up with comments at first glance
 struct: you use lua here?
 One-Six: I do, yeah
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: lua is great.  I like a language with a rock solid heredoc
 One-Six: it's been a while since i used anything, and I learned some Lua for mediawiki stuff... so it ended up being my strongest language
 struct: gloria you need to stop using these fancy words
 One-Six: yeah, Lua documents are really good
 struct: every sentence you type I have to google at least one word
 One-Six: wait, heredoc is not manul
 One-Six: manual*
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: rock?
 struct: yeah
 struct: jk, I had no idea what heredoc was, never heard that word before
 One-Six: i assumed "document" as in manualdear princess celestia, today i learned not to assume what word means
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: ah, it is just something I use a bunch with all my system shenanigans
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: some languages are awful, java looks like this:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: String s="g++ -o prog -x c++ - &lt;&lt;A\n" +"#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n" + 
 struct: can you compile as o3 like that?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: pragmas don't work, but you can put in command line flags
 struct: nice
 One-Six: wait, lua has heredoc?
 struct: I thought all lua documentation was in portuguese
 One-Six: XDD
 One-Six: I mean, it's not the most awesome document, but it works?
 One-Six: There's also the Programming with Lua book; the 5.0 version is freely available online too
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Here_document#Lua">https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Here_document#Lua</a>
 One-Six: yeah, I guess I haven't quite grasp what exactly is heredoc
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: it is just a multi-line string
 One-Six: i see
 One-Six: then yes, the lua bracketing method is pretty great
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: right.  it doesn't break if there is a quote in it or something
 One-Six: yeah
 One-Six: though I haven't use square bracket much myself, XD
 struct: i feel that is sarcasm
 One-Six: since I use Lua with mediawiki stuff though, I actually use it to generate HTML and wikitext...
 One-Six: someone had told me I shouldn't just sprinkle string concatenations everywhere, but i already did so...
 One-Six: they said table.concat is supposedly more efficient process-wise
 One-Six: (which concatenates an "array"'s value into a long string, with a separator string of your choice)

 aCat: sorry noone watched this 8h ;p
 Phiti: the simulator is bad
 struct: which one?
 Miki09: gm everyone
 struct: gm
 struct: this rng games kill me
 Miki09: After about hour of debugging, I finally found the bug!
 jacek: spoiler alert: it got worse after fixing it
 Miki09: hmmm
 Miki09: It caused that I was trying to throw cards that I dont have
 Miki09: jacek you were right!!
 Miki09: fixing it caused another bug
 struct: oh no
 Miki09: Miki09 provided incorrect input. you do not have a card of type BONUS to deprioritize
 oidrissi: You just need to handle that
 miobyte: how to handle it?
 oidrissi: wait, to deprioritize?
 Miki09: hmmmm
 StevenV: Boss 4 must moveBoss 4 has in hand: TASK_PRIORITIZATION (3), CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION (5), TECHNICAL_DEBT (9), BONUS (8)Boss 4 has not provided an action in time.Boss 4 was disqualified.
 StevenV: boss have bug&#160;:*
 Miki09: yes

 StevenV: :D
 eulerscheZahl: if only boss 5 was like that
 StevenV: well based on number of legends, boss5 is strong
 eulerscheZahl: higher bosses are all player codes. totally possible that they have a bug. but doesn't matter as long as their strength is right
 eulerscheZahl: boss5 is an idiot. at least character-wise
 StevenV: yup
 StevenV: still can't get out of silver&#160;:(
 Miki09: me too
 Miki09: submitting

 Nerchio: euler do you have probabilities
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: i have bad gameplay
 Nerchio: :D
 Miki09: Does anybody know what is the fastest time you can win a game?
 Nerchio: 1 turn if your opponent times out
 struct: depends if opponent helps you
 Miki09: if he isnt there
 Miki09: and if eberything goes perfect
 Miki09: I think it can be about 15 to 20 moves
 Miki09: but idk
 Nerchio: i've seen people win on their 2nd pass so i am sure its a lot faster
 Miki09: hmm
 StevenV: I would call it OTK
 Nerchio: i fix one thing another one falls apart :grimacing:
 aCat: how it works - if I use review to generate 2 bonuses on empty discard
 aCat: and then e.g. training I can pull them on the same turn?
 struct: I would say yes
 struct: but havent tested
 kovi: you mean empty draw + empty discard
 aCat: aye
 struct: I saw on the referee that bonus do get added to the discard pile
 struct: so it should work
 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/2rivmBk">https://imgur.com/a/2rivmBk</a>
 aCat: running 6 then running 0
 aCat: ah no action 6 on this image, but you know what I mean
 struct: then you should draw 2 bonus
 struct: Anyways I'm going to see if I can rest a bit
 jacek: since yesterday whenever i submit to arena i have recaptcha
 jacek: i submited second time today
 jacek: "boss5 is an idiot. at least character-wise" :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: i stand by my opinion
 jacek: then all below him are idioter
 DaNinja: :D
 jacek: oh, where are my manners
 jacek: happy Caturday!

 eulerscheZahl: frame 15: i want to automate a bonus. it's my opponents turn?
 kovi: maybe you draw 2xtd
 eulerscheZahl: draw what?
 kovi: on train
 eulerscheZahl: ah, 2 x technical debt
 eulerscheZahl: you guys and your acronyms
 kovi: what is misleading in these casesis you see next turn draw already
 eulerscheZahl: yes that can be it. the viewer always confuses me

 eulerscheZahl: go Sheeeesh
 eulerscheZahl: just kick the boss harder than me
 jacek: oh my
 mannouao: go gooo Sheeesh you can do it
 kovi: nice sheesh
 eulerscheZahl: YEEEES
 eulerscheZahl: than you therealbeef and highjump
 eulerscheZahl: thank*
 Nerchio: gz
 therealbeef: lol
 Astrobytes: pushed to legend finally euler?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but i also improved my bot. still got lucky in the end by waiting
 eulerscheZahl: now i don't have to delete
 Astrobytes: nice, grats&#160;:)
 Scarfield: nice :muscle:
 fathidevs: is it normal to get angry when stuck at a challenge?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Scarfield: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Michael_Howard: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: or desperate, depends on your personality
 fathidevs: or headache lol
 BoBot: Codingame therapy
 BoBot: :O
 eulerscheZahl: sheesh doing well in legend too
 Michael_Howard: Take a break then come back.
 Michael_Howard: ┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠノ)
 Astrobytes: yeah, he's smashing it
 Astrobytes: nice
 jacek: he clearly overfitted to boss
 Sheeesh---: lol
 eulerscheZahl: he was "only" 1 point above the boss. now 6th currently. shows how close scores are in this game
 Sheeesh---: removed a scoring variable
 Sheeesh---: and this changed my bot dramatically
 Astrobytes: clearly!&#160;:)
 jacek: scoring? so you dont care about released apps?
 Sheeesh---: nop
 StevenV: 0.01 below the boss&#160;:(
 StevenV:&#160;:*
 eulerscheZahl: just wait there and don't touch anything
 eulerscheZahl: the yellow button in particular
 kovi: Sheeesh--- #3 unbelievable
 StevenV: thank, I hope can go to gold
 Scarfield: dayum
 Scarfield: 2 python bots in top 6 at this point, impressive :muscle:
 eulerscheZahl: #3 with val growth resubmitting. but still a very strong performance
 Astrobytes: StevenV: awesome!
 eulerscheZahl: did he get pushed?
 StevenV: no
 Astrobytes: no but he will I think
 Scarfield: when you are that close, you should get pushed at some point&#160;:)
 StevenV: pushed down actually :D
 Astrobytes: still close enough
 BoBot: how important is DAILY_ROUTINE, if at all (except in real life.. :P )
 BoBot:&#160;?
 BoBot: last skill I am doing anything with, I sometimes lose too much from avoiding giving cards to the opponent, maybe that would fix it..
 jacek: i wish i knew the rules
 KNTK: Can I have light mode somehow?
 eulerscheZahl: in the IDE: left =&gt; settings
 BoBot: I found out yesterday that all shoddy skills are wildcards, not just BONUS cards.....
 Michael_Howard: BoBot I haven't been able to make it be useful, not because my TP code doesn't work, but because it's never in situations where playing it would be useful, i.e. to be able to swap to get a release. I need to watch more games &amp; figure out what I need to do to create opportunities for it.
 kovi: jacek lolactually i just saw your nn automating 3rd instance of a (nonbonus) skill
 KNTK: Thanks! eulerscheZahl
 jacek: is that bad?
 BoBot: @Michael_Howard yea, also I feel like having the card in your deck (instead of DEBT) might be more useful than playing it...but maybe I am looking at it the wrong way
 eulerscheZahl: val growth also does intersting things. like doing a full turn to dump 2 skill cards and pick up one he just dumped. probably because he already knows that he has won
 kovi: well...if you have nothing else to do...it doesnt hurt (i havent checked where you did it)
 Michael_Howard: BoBot playing it would be great if the release swap was available when the card is in hand.
 jacek: :upside_down:
 BoBot: @Michael_Howard I did not realize DAILY_ROUTINEs stack... also realized now that it is not just avoiding the opponent, you can also stack grab more than one copy of a skill in a single "tour"
 BoBot: decided to implement it
 StevenV: 25s and I am in gold
 StevenV: I success :D
 BoBot: gratz...also, you pushed me down a lot an hour ago, I was like 1:8 against you
 Astrobytes: congrats StevenV!
 BoBot: maybe it will help me
 StevenV: :D
 Crosility: Morning!
 Miki09: morning
 Miki09: why did I jumped 30 places in couple hours?
 eulerscheZahl: magic
 eulerscheZahl: also works in the opposite direction
 Miki09: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Htaj3o3JD8I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Htaj3o3JD8I</a>
 Miki09: Magic O.O
 Nerchio: pls stop feeding the boss in gold people
 eulerscheZahl: now that i passed, it's ok
 eulerscheZahl: smallest legend league so far was code of ice and fire i think
 eulerscheZahl: 44 in legend. i think we can top that at least
 BrunoFelthes: any tips to beat the gold boss?
 j4at: players in legends feeding the boss using their alts to stop the others from reaching legend :o
 eulerscheZahl: the boss is the only thing that prevents Nerchio from beating me again
 BrunoFelthes: eulerscheZahl, to beat the boss, i need to planning more than one turn?
 BrunoFelthes: are you planning?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 BrunoFelthes: you are scoring just one turn from move to release?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Nerchio: euler in the end i was suffering in games vs you :P
 Nerchio: my bot is garbage I just want legend and i will leave it as legend garbage
 Miki09: "my bot is garbage"
 Miki09: "one of top 50 tops in the world"
 Miki09: *bots
 Nerchio: well sometimes its not just about rank :D
 Kellthazar: j4at, something like that: if my.Score == 4 &amp;&amp; game.Phase == "RELEASE" { return "WAIT" }
 eulerscheZahl: we just have different understandings of garbage
 eulerscheZahl: for some of us everything below top10 is garbage
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm still on that 1 turn search which is very limited. i'm not proud of it
 j4at: O(1) you should be proud :p
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile bowow is going for the top with some aggressive continuous integration strategy
 Crosility: Lol eulerscheZahl. "Everything below top 10 is garbage". Ouch. Well, place me and my code next to the dumpster. :P
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry, i fall into the same category
 eulerscheZahl: and totally stuck. would need a full rewrite but don't even know what to make better
 Crosility: MORE nested loops. MORE checks. More.. more..
 Miki09: more bugs...
 Crosility: ^
 StevenV: how can I go into legend&#160;:(
 StevenV: I have to rewrite my code completely to go higher, welll
 struct: grast on legend euler
 aCat: oh nice eulr gratulations&#160;:-)
 struct: I had my alarm set for when euler got legend
 eulerscheZahl: thank you. got right into mid legend when iwas pushed
 eulerscheZahl: looks like my current modification might be bad
 MSmits: congrats Euler 
 emh: gz
 eulerscheZahl: thank you. one of the toughest contest legends for me so far
 MSmits: yeah this was hard
 MSmits: I feel lucky i got past at al
 MSmits: I havent made any improvement since
 eulerscheZahl: my promotion code got me in top10 temporarily. now i resubmitted and i'm at the bottom of the league
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: above me
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know how to evaluate my changes anymore
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: unless they completely break my bot, then I know how to evaluate them :P
 struct: can't break what is already broken
 MSmits: thanks :P
 emh: I've finished porting my Java bot to C++ and partially merged with the sim bot. now I'm looking at 132k and needing to trim it to 100k. still have double input mechanism so might be doable
 Astrobytes: am watching an independence rally and chatting whilst half-heartedly attempting to fix my crap bot
 MSmits: I just flew in a plane an hour ago
 Astrobytes: where to/from?
 MSmits: just a tour, small plane 4 passengers + pilot
 MSmits: my daughter was in the copilot seat
 Astrobytes: ahh that's awesome
 MSmits: around my home town
 Astrobytes: she like it?
 MSmits: she sure did
 Astrobytes: Great stuff man
 MSmits: I had never been in a plane before myself
 Astrobytes: Really? Did you enjoy it too?
 MSmits: yeah it was cool
 MSmits: we had to kind of watch out in the beginning so my daughter wouldnt make us crash
 MSmits: she could move the steering thingy
 MSmits: and we weren't sure if she would
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: that would give a fun headline in the news
 Astrobytes: Best to look out for these things indeed
 Astrobytes: Time to get your pilots license MSmits :D
 MSmits: lol eulerscheZahl. Personally I was thinking, if I crash now at least I'm not stuck in gold like euler
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: glad to be with you in your last thoughts :D
 MSmits: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: nerchio might get pushed any moment now
 Nerchio: not really
 Nerchio: i am sitting here for the past 2 hours
 MSmits: hope you make it
 emh: there was a new terror attack in Oslo
 MSmits: what happened?
 Astrobytes: saw that earlier emh
 emh: someone shooting
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: bad&#160;:(
 emh: a friend who used to go to the club notified me, because I was too busy programming to read the news
 MSmits: you mean who used to go to the club where it happened or do you mean it's a friend you used to go to the club with?
 emh: where it happened
 MSmits: ah i see
 emh: I've been there a few times too but it's not my favourite
 Pap3r: i have arrived
 emh: but now I live in Bergen since January
 emh: I'm out of energy again damnit. need to minify bot
 MSmits: more red bull?
 emh: had 2 energy drinks yesterday, feeling the drain
 emh: one today
 MSmits: I have slept 4-6 hrs a night all week, almost non stop coding when not working. Not a single drop of caffeine. I think you get used to it which makes you need it
 emh: yeahh maybe
 MSmits: if i take caffeine I get lots of problems, it works too well i think
 MSmits: heartrate gets irregular, hyperventilation, twitching etc.
 emh: I'm not so sensitive anymore
 emh: I got used to it
 MSmits: yeah 
 MSmits: hyperventilation is scary if you dont know what happens
 emh: I had it once when I took a blood sample at the doctor
 emh: they gave me a brown paper bag
 emh: and said to breathe into it
 MSmits: dont think that works
 emh: yeah me neither
 MSmits: it's more a placebo thing
 emh: exactly
 MSmits: which kinda works
 emh: hehe
 MSmits: they could have given you a stuffed bear also
 struct: thanks MSmits now that trick wont work for me anymore&#160;:/
 emh: heheheh
 MSmits: sorry :P
 MSmits: there are easy solutions that work
 MSmits: best one is just close your mouth
 MSmits: breathe through nose
 MSmits: you can also go for a walk if you have the opportunity
 struct: Never happened to me
 MSmits: that balances things out
 MSmits: hasnt for a while with me either. 
 MSmits: people confuse it with a panic attack. It really isnt
 MSmits: you just have too little CO2 in blood
 MSmits: you dont need to be stressed or scared for it to happen
 MSmits: just breathing wrong will do it
 struct: I'll probably wont remember this if it happens to me
 MSmits: maybe you will&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's not dangerous anyway, just scary if you don't understand it
 MSmits: just like vertigo, I had that 1 time. Soo scary. Never happened again after
 MSmits: just randomly in the evening
 Astrobytes: I had vertigo with racing heartbeat (like 200bpm+) for apparently no reason over a month or 2
 MSmits: wow, for the whole time&#160;??
 Astrobytes: used to happen randomly, they reckoned it was a middle ear issue
 MSmits: ah yeah
 MSmits: the worst thing for me was lying down made it wose
 MSmits: worse
 struct: Dont think my heart rate can reach 200 anymore
 struct: I must try it
 Astrobytes: very weird feeling vertigo
 Astrobytes: I don't advise it struct lol
 MSmits: yeah, you try to focus on 1 point and the world keeps spinning away from you
 struct: My peak was around 210 like 3 years ago
 geppoz: question: if i have in hand 2 bonus and 1 coding, and i go thru ADM_DESK, the first THROW 8 is considered forced and so autoplayed? or the THROW phase is guaranteed to be 2 step even if one is forced?
 struct: this when making sports, cycling
 Astrobytes: that's fair enough. It's not fun as a resting rate
 DaNinja: 2 steps in that case
 geppoz: so in any case, right? it is or totally forced or totally choosen, right?
 DaNinja: yes, either totally forced or total manually chosen
 eulerscheZahl: "you just have too little CO2 in blood"then the paper bag should help, shouldn't it?
 eulerscheZahl: you breath in the same air again, that you already used to replace oxygen by carbon dioxide
 DaNinja: its forced when all cards same or only 2 or less skill cards in hand
 struct: once you do a first throw you must do a second
 struct: you only dont get a choice if you have less than 3 cards or 1 card type only
 struct: or no cards 
 struct: what ninja siad
 struct: said*
 geppoz: no, teoretically even when you have 2 types of cards, but one type only contains 1 card, should be "half-forced"
 DaNinja: no, referee doesnt handle that
 geppoz: e.g. if I have 5 cards, 4 of type A and 1 of type B, I had to THROW an A
 geppoz: ok ty just to be sure
 DaNinja: np
 struct: you mean if you throw B right? but yeah referee doesnt handle it
 geppoz: no i meant, the referee could consider an A already thrown, and let you the choice to throw a second A or a B, but ok, it is not handled
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl i think the air refreshes too fast for it to make a difference
 struct: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: then you should take a plastic bag instead?
 MSmits: if you hate hyperventilating more than you like your life then yes. Either way problem solved :P
 emh: you know what they say, it's all empty space, because between particles there is empty space. well I shaved 30k off my bot by replacing spaces with tabs lol
 eulerscheZahl: just unindent everything in the web IDE
 eulerscheZahl: ctrl+a, shift+tab
 emh: hmm good idea
 eulerscheZahl: this submit is able to climb again
 eulerscheZahl: either i'm stuck at the very bottom or i got to mid league it seems
 eulerscheZahl: nothing between
 eulerscheZahl: i mentioned it. of course i'm going down now :D
 miobyte: alas I am undone
 baneetparmar: hello world
 baneetparmar: is there a way we can make party and keeping on doing clash of code as a party?
 struct: you have to keep inviting each other
 struct: There is no way to make a party
 baneetparmar: oh that's bad, thanks for info tho
 IvesL: does skill card (shoddy skills) have higher priority than bonus card?
 MSmits: struct partypooper
 miobyte: can we allow here discuss programming only?
 MSmits: IvesL it has no effect what has priority, unless you mean how your bot should make choices on what cards to get
 struct: you will always get the lowest tech debt possible IvesL
 struct: When releasing
 MSmits: you discard all your cards aftet release
 IvesL: i see
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh lord, finally found bug.  in some situations I was playing cards when i could have done a releaase and ended the game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: bot still sucks, but gonna see if i can do better than 34 silver
 PatrickMcGinnisII: up to 28th, smh - stuck in silver...gtg...glhf
 eulerscheZahl: those silver games are fun to watch, over 100 frames :o
 Nerchio: you dont have better things to do in legend? 
 struct: :p
 Nerchio: i just won 2 games and got 0.02 what a joke
 MSmits: low ranked opponents
 MSmits: rated
 Nerchio: nah
 Nerchio: this guy is top5 just maybe start of his submit idk
 Nerchio: anyway 
 Nerchio: in this game
 Nerchio: 0.02 for winning 2 games is a joek :D
 Nerchio: joke
 struct: One strange thing about this contest is seeing jacek so quiet
 Nerchio: you can easily lose
 Nerchio: too busy with NN
 struct: no, he is using true AI
 eulerscheZahl: 2 distinct games or 1 mirrored game?
 eulerscheZahl: because these pairs only count as 1 game
 Nerchio: OMG
 eulerscheZahl: and tie + win is a win in total
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you did it?
 Nerchio: what a winning streak my garbage beautiful baby
 eulerscheZahl: 29.58 both
 struct: grats
 eulerscheZahl: i can't see it. are you above or below the boss?
 ppint: i feel so stupid after playing this for like 10 minutes lol
 struct: above
 kovi: in legend now
 kovi: gratz
 eulerscheZahl: congrats, welcome to legend
 Nerchio: thanks guys
 Nerchio: it was difficult
 eulerscheZahl: blame jacek and illedan
 Nerchio: i do blame them :grinning:
 Sheeesh---: congrats!
 MSmits: oh nice, grats
 struct: I cant lose my legend streak to this game
 eulerscheZahl: streak of 1?
 struct: no
 struct: streak of 3 or 4
 eulerscheZahl: just teasing
 Nerchio: where are you euler I am here to steal your points now
 eulerscheZahl: hiding well from you
 eulerscheZahl: 2 ranks above, where you would never sispect
 Nerchio: I will keep you company at the bottom :sunglasses:
 eulerscheZahl: you promised to stop now and let your bot be a legend pushover
 Nerchio: I have last tweak ready, maybe like 0.1% better I think but yeah thats it from me :D
 Nerchio: can't play without probabilities, misses too many good plays
 struct: One question about draw, discard, at the end of the turn if the draw pile is empty and discard has cards, do the played cards and hand go to discard and then the discard goes to the draw?
 struct: or the discard goes to the draw and only after the played and hand go into discard?
 DaNinja: discards got to draw
 struct: But all cards go into discard before it right?
 struct: I think I just saw a replay and it answers my question
 DaNinja: ah yes, hand+played go to discard, then discard goes to draw
 struct: thank you
 BrunoFelthes: congrats Nerchio!!!
 BrunoFelthes: DaNinja, but during the turn, the dircard goes to the draw too, no?
 BrunoFelthes: if the draw is empty
 struct: only if you use training or coding
 struct: if you dont it will only go after release
 DaNinja: right
 BrunoFelthes: sure
 BrunoFelthes: there is no other way to draw, there is?
 struct: no
 DaNinja: just those 3
 DaNinja: draw 1, draw 2, draw 4+architects
 Nerchio: thanks BrunoFelthes and good luck I hope you can get legend soon
 DaNinja: after WAIT&lt; when the referee says you can release application, does it mean you have enough points to release something?
 eulerscheZahl: when you enter the RELEASE phase and the referee doesn't just skip you, you can always release
 eulerscheZahl: note: you can even release something with 8 shoddy skills (except the last app)
 DaNinja: ah ok, it auto skips
 eulerscheZahl: which makes it a pain to watch the replay sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: TRAININGi don't show you what cards you drew. end of turn and i'll load your new hand right away
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: gj nerchy
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: doggy style
 eulerscheZahl: that reminds me: where's NinjaDoggy?
 DaNinja: there can only be one ninja
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: are you the real deal?
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: the unique?
 DaNinja: da
 j4at: No, you can't see the real ninga they are in disguise
 j4at: ninja*
 WhatTrickeryIsThis: i hope you have the nija CI card strat for yourself
 therealbeef: therealninja
 Sunny_96: HMMMMMMMMMMm
 IvesL: can we know if the desk still provide skill card without getting a bonus from it?
 MSmits: yeah, just calculate how many cards are left in it
 MSmits: 5 - everything else
 Sheeesh---: "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time."
 eulerscheZahl: F
 Sheeesh---: how can i test my code then&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: offline
 darkhorse64: including permanent_cards and automated cards
 IvesL: alright
 Sheeesh---: how&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: clone and execute the github repo
 eulerscheZahl: or create an alt account and get banned&#160;;)
 Sheeesh---: getting banned souns good
 Sheeesh---: sounds*
 geppoz: "permanent cards" question: when you play them, they go in discarded right? they are not like "automated" that remains in a separate group
 MSmits: they are separate
 MSmits: it's kind of a weird card location
 geppoz: they dont go in played then discarded?
 struct: Think of it like a passive skill
 darkhorse64: permanent_cards are discarded when you do a release
 MSmits: no geppoz
 struct: They get removed
 struct: and are permanently in your automated
 MSmits: thats confusing struct
 geppoz: i mean DAILY_ROUTING
 geppoz: when you play it, not automate it
 darkhorse64: it goes to permanent
 geppoz: it increments your distance pick, then go in discard
 MSmits: when you play daily or arch, they go into a "permanent card slot", this is its own card location
 struct: yes
 struct: it goes in played 1st
 geppoz: well
 struct: then it will go into discard
 MSmits: no it doesnt struct
 MSmits: it never goes into played
 Nerchio: but if you make an app they go back to discard right?
 darkhorse64: when release
 MSmits: when release it just goes to discard
 struct: when you play a card it doesnt go into played?
 struct: ah
 MSmits: when you play daily or arch it doesnt struct
 struct: too much confusion going on for me
 struct: daily doesnt go into played?
 MSmits: no
 struct: thats a bit confusing 
 MSmits: arch neither
 MSmits: it is
 darkhorse64: we will fully understand the statement after the contest
 geppoz: :D
 geppoz: so my count is wrong
 MSmits: think of it like this struct: You get arch and daily separately in input. Consider it its own card location
 MSmits: even though it is not called a card location
 geppoz: i put them in played, then in discarded at end of turn (not end of release)
 darkhorse64: meanwhile, I just discovered that I went to gold with a huge bug that let me release less often
 struct: Now im even more confused
 geppoz: struct :D
 struct: So I play Daily routine
 struct: what happens?
 struct: Card goes into discard and my grab distance increases?
 darkhorse64: goes to permanent
 MSmits: it goes into the daily card location 
 MSmits: i hesitate to call this permanent
 MSmits: but yes
 darkhorse64: ^
 struct: but card goes into discard instead of played?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: only after release
 struct: ah
 MSmits: it doesnt go into played ever
 MSmits: and only to discard after release
 struct: So I need another location
 struct: oh my
 geppoz: me too
 struct: Why not just keep it on played...
 MSmits: not necessarily, if you just keep track of active dailies and arch, you already have this as a location
 struct: Would be easier
 geppoz: tbh it just impacts the "available(ix)" function
 geppoz: yeah MSmits
 MSmits: no its not struct, because if you kept it on played, it would always go to discard at end of turn
 MSmits: and it doesnt do that
 MSmits: only if you release
 struct: ah
 struct: Now it makes sense
 struct: the card is removed until release
 struct: Now I understand it
 struct: thanks
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: i went through your exact confusion. 
 eulerscheZahl: i had to learn it this morning only
 geppoz: anyway I need to add opp_daily and opp_archi to the state...
 eulerscheZahl: my sim still doesn't account for it. meh, rare case
 eulerscheZahl: no one likes those cards, 1 is enough
 DaNinja: my.hand[2]--; my.routines++;
 DaNinja: ezpz
 kovi: stacking arch is interesting in the final random struggle
 eulerscheZahl: there is no struggle in legend, they control the random. at least it feels like it, they just win
 kovi: i know. mcts is strong
 struct: Nice my bot doesnt like this fix
 struct:&#160;:)
 MSmits: ye, fixing bugs can make fall off a local maximum 
 MSmits: probably your eval counts your arch or daily cards double now
 MSmits: making them too important
 MSmits: some bug of that type
 struct: It wont just play them
 struct: because it think its better to keep them in hand I guess
 MSmits: yes thats problematic
 struct: Anyways I need to start the mcts to know the poll results
 eulerscheZahl: i voted for significant waste of time
 MSmits: same
 struct: What is significant?
 MSmits: or was there  a worse one?
 struct: How much time are we talking about?
 struct: Completely waste of time
 eulerscheZahl: there was worse
 MSmits: oh i picked worse :P
 struct: which is the one I voted
 eulerscheZahl: i just liked "significant" :D
 MSmits: good reason
 therealbeef: thanks for the push kovi&#160;;-)
 kovi: highjump is still working on it
 kovi: but yeah its better for me if you go to legend
 eulerscheZahl: 0.3, you can make it
 eulerscheZahl: an exercise about patience
 therealbeef: stop hitting the yellow button yeah
 Wontonimo: Anyone know or have a feel for the algo bowwow, valgroth, and square101 are using  (bad spel in purpos)
 eulerscheZahl: from past contests i'd say Val is using some MCTS / DUCT approach
 The_Duck: what is DUCT?
 eulerscheZahl: you with a typo
 The_Duck: haha
 eulerscheZahl: decoupled UCT
 MSmits: :grin:
 therealbeef: ducktape
 MSmits: duct doesnt really make sense here I think, isnt this mostly for instantaneous moves?
 MSmits: simultaneous sry
 eulerscheZahl: right
 eulerscheZahl: then MCTS :D
 eulerscheZahl: bowwow added a lot of ifs according to his twitter
 Wontonimo: if it looks like a duct, shaped like a duct, and blows like a duct, it's probably a duct
 MSmits: i've been studying his ifs
 eulerscheZahl: square is a new player to me, no idea
 MSmits: but if i put them in my bot it is worse :P
 eulerscheZahl: very centered around automating boni
 Wontonimo: probably because they don't play nice with your current ifs&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: bonuses. i'm learning astro
 MSmits: i had no ifs
 MSmits: just sim/search/eval
 MSmits: instead of trying to make it act like bowwow through eval, i tried to make it copy him, but no luck, well the copying works, but its worse
 kovi: considering winrates i resubmit to push therealbeef and highjump
 Wontonimo: any book MSmits?  it's your signature thing
 eulerscheZahl: noo kovi
 MSmits: not really. I guess you could book the initial 5 turns or so
 eulerscheZahl: let them suffer like the rest of us had
 MSmits: but that can be done with some ifs
 eulerscheZahl: :imp:
 kovi: that way i have chance to overfit and go legend as well
 therealbeef: i remember i pushed you euler
 eulerscheZahl: you and high jump
 Astrobytes: lol euler (re boni)
 eulerscheZahl: ok do it kovi
 Wontonimo: team effort
 eulerscheZahl: do you also say maluses?
 Astrobytes: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i've heard bonuses a few times. when it comes to extra payments
 eulerscheZahl: was partially messing with you
 Astrobytes: malus is generally reserved for legal documents etc
 Astrobytes: financial term etc
 therealbeef: If kovi's pushes are not enough, I hope my NN pipeline can come up with some sweet weights tonight
 Wontonimo: so very close therealbeef ... just a fraction away
 Wontonimo: what's your NN shape?  Layers / nodes therealbeef&#160;?  (if you don't mind sharing)
 Wontonimo: or, if that's too 'classified', do you mind sharing what method of NN training you are using?  packprop, evolution, something else?
 therealbeef: experimenting a lot with that actually; more inputs/more layers/wider layers. it's quite frustrating because most things don't work
 Wontonimo: good initialization using can really speed up training.  Glorot and He is pretty good and not too difficult to hand-code if you have a hand-coded initialization.
 The_Duck: therealbeef are you doing RL or supervised learning?
 MSmits: don't think this version is very good Sheeesh---, but thanks for the pushes
 Wontonimo: *using Glorot can
 Sheeesh---: don't worry
 Sheeesh---: i'm just testing in arena
 eulerscheZahl: he's hiding
 Sheeesh---: instead of ide xD
 MSmits: ok, I will be your dummy
 Sheeesh---: you will return it back
 eulerscheZahl: careful, there's a submit limit too
 eulerscheZahl: don't trigger it right before the contest ends
 Wontonimo: :scream:
 Sheeesh---: oh
 Sheeesh---: that's bad
 eulerscheZahl: there are different limits. the longest is 24h i think. at least it is for IDE plays
 therealbeef: i'm using random init, then one round of learning from self-play of my best bot sofar, and then repeat self-play learning based on states that led to wins, until plateau'ing. but i'm no expert on this. this is the first contest where it works kind of reasonably for me
 kovi: one more
 kovi: either win vs boss, or loose vs you
 eulerscheZahl: do you tweak to win against the boss or to lose against therealbeef?
 eulerscheZahl: that winrate against beef :D
 kovi: i dont want to waste time fixing it if i can push him
 IvesL: do you guys think if it is advantageous to go first or not?
 Wontonimo: i heard that first is best, but i'm not even in the contest
 BrunoFelthes: of course is
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even sure what's better
 eulerscheZahl: would have do download some replays and compile statistics
 Miki09: If I run the same code vs same code, the first player allways wins
 eulerscheZahl: might even differ for different bots
 IvesL: i do think so as well, player 1 sort of control how player 2 moves and takes
 IvesL: imo
 kovi: player2 has the ability to adjust on favorable td balance...and turn a draw to win
 kovi: (on 4th app)
 Nerchio: I thought p1 is too good but i didn't see that advantage in my bot
 Nerchio: maybe it's luck of the draw maybe something else idk
 Razovsky: hi Westicles 
 Razovsky: i don't understand your idea
 Razovsky: to move chat into a contribution chat
 Razovsky: u hope that players will move to the contribution to discuss&#160;?
 Illedan: Hi
 the-mysterious: hi
 struct: hi
 Scarfield: oi
 Nerchio: hola
 eulerscheZahl: ille writes "hi" and submits
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not surprised
 Illedan: I always submit
 Illedan: Hi is because I'm back home to my computer
 Nerchio: how many submits you got
 Nerchio: i have 157
 Illedan: Rookie numbers
 kovi: almost double
 eulerscheZahl: 81
 print[Hello_World]: 1638 / 1687 :disappointed_relieved:
 Nerchio: and I thought I was submitting a lot :thinking:
 Illedan: 323 :D
 eulerscheZahl: and i thought i'm the submit spammer
 Nerchio: but well I was gone for 2 days maybe thats why
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not. i'll celebrate with 3 more submits
 eulerscheZahl: usually i end up somewhere around 100-120 submits in a contest
 Illedan: If they inc IDE plays, I'll submit less :P
 eulerscheZahl: no you wouldn't
 Nerchio: yeah submitting seems like a good way to test your bot
 Nerchio: or renting a VM
 Nerchio: :joy:
 Illedan: Offline testing failed
 Illedan: So online testing it is
 Yakeromo: Is it okay changing default code in games, or i need to understand how to adapt my code to make it compitable
 BrunoFelthes: i already sent 300 submits
 eulerscheZahl: you can delete everything and start fro scratch Yakeromo
 eulerscheZahl: just make sure you follow the exact input/output protocol
 struct: thats a lot of submits
 struct: lol
 BrunoFelthes: my dream is just pay to submit faster
 eulerscheZahl: struct at 7 i'd say
 Yakeromo: Big thanks
 BrunoFelthes: someone need to create a parallel server
 struct: nah on this contst i submited a lot
 struct: im at 37
 struct: 36*
 BrunoFelthes: eulerscheZahl, create an online paid brutaltester, please...
 eulerscheZahl: not in my powers
 BrunoFelthes: why not... did you not created the brutaltester for this contest?
 eulerscheZahl: online there is a play limit
 BrunoFelthes: i will do it one day
 eulerscheZahl: google "cg benchmark" if you don't know it already
 eulerscheZahl: it's from Neuman n
 BrunoFelthes: once i can understand this thing about brutal tester
 Nerchio: "submitted a lot" 36 :joy:
 kovi: bruno meant an alternative testing arena maybe
 eulerscheZahl: 81 submits - i got my IQ right there
 struct: cg bench its not a good idea with the new limit
 Nerchio: yeah cg bench is not so good anymore&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: our own website where we can upload bots in parallel to CG?
 struct: I think thats what he meant
 BrunoFelthes: yes...
 eulerscheZahl: ah, hm
 eulerscheZahl: that could work
 eulerscheZahl: but do you trust me not to reverse your codes?
 eulerscheZahl: and who pays?
 Nerchio: he already said he pays :D
 eulerscheZahl: right
 struct: pay per game
 BrunoFelthes: and could benchmark faster with other players... would you use paing it?
 eulerscheZahl: my hourly rate is at $100 for development
 struct: Can you do it in 30 minutes?
 eulerscheZahl: ezpz
 struct: its a good idea in theory
 emh: I finished combining my heuristic with my sim but my search is totally broken
 kovi: isnt it possible to do cgbench 1vs1?both client running locally and only the referee is remote?
 BrunoFelthes: same here emh
 Nerchio: euler while you're at it please create a side-chat&#160;;)
 emh: BrunoFelthes my sympathies
 eulerscheZahl: hm, that's what the original vindinium did, kovi
 eulerscheZahl: actually i like the idea
 kovi: this way we dont need to trust you&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: no execution of untrusted code on the server. significantly less load
 kovi: and half of the cost ...yeah
 eulerscheZahl: you might even be able to pull it off with free hosting like my puzzle search
 kovi: yeah, but the main point is to have a community crosstesting
 eulerscheZahl: all you need is a local client to communicate with the server and forward it to the local bot instance(s)and a way to run the java referee on the server
 eulerscheZahl: not trivial but actually sounds doable
 eulerscheZahl: too bad that i have retired from CG&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: retired my ass :P
 BrunoFelthes: once that i have more than 1 app to release, that will give the same TD, with one should i delivere?
 eulerscheZahl: 1 turn search, you can't call that competing astro
 Astrobytes: it's a tough game man
 eulerscheZahl: and full heuristics in the spider contest. that was just having a quick look at the game
 eulerscheZahl: oh, highjump jumped into legend
 Astrobytes: not giving 100%&#160;!= retirement
 struct: Im about to retire yeah
 Nerchio: "1 turn search, you can't call that competing" :sob:
 struct: from coding
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i somehow lack motivation to go the extra mile that would be necessary
 Astrobytes: that word again :D
 eulerscheZahl: take some risk and try a search that might not work but has chances of not getting me stuck with suboptimal magic numbers
 eulerscheZahl: which i'm tweaking for 2 days
 Astrobytes: you still have time...
 eulerscheZahl: meh
 Astrobytes: Also, Legend achieved so...
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have to delete
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: saved until next contest
 Nerchio: yet
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i just home that CG has the topcoder calendar in mind when scheduling their next contest
 eulerscheZahl: hope*
 Astrobytes: I'll watch the livestream regardless. Solidarity! :muscle:
 eulerscheZahl: will be as exciting as watching wet color dry
 Astrobytes: Yes but it's the moral support factor
 eulerscheZahl: i'm more worried of missing a CG contest
 eulerscheZahl: except if it's an escape, then i'm fine with missing it
 Astrobytes: I can do other things and look at that now and then
 Astrobytes: I suspect they learned a lesson using Escapes as contests
 Astrobytes: I could be wrong...
 eulerscheZahl: the core community was not amused. but they also got some positive feedback
 Astrobytes: well there's nothing inherently wrong with escapes, just replacing the usual contest with them was... a very odd move
 struct: my improved bot cant win a  single game
 Astrobytes: and that's an improvement?
 eulerscheZahl: it runs 10% more simulations
 Astrobytes: :D
 Nerchio: you need to build applications struct
 struct: I tried to brute force depth 2 instead of 1
 eulerscheZahl: probably a bug in my code. i also tried depth 2 and it was beyond stupid
 kovi: you cant bruteforce the big draw
 eulerscheZahl: you can try a deterministic random so your bot at least always assumes the same following cards
 Nerchio: i don't even include draw in my bot so i'd have to play depth 2 without cards :wink:
 eulerscheZahl: and doesn't try to "hack RNG"
 kovi: did karang succeeded?
 Astrobytes: don't think so
 eulerscheZahl: probably not
 Astrobytes: at least hasn't said anything
 eulerscheZahl: saw in the chat logs that he asked for me specifically while i was asleep
 eulerscheZahl: then didn't leave a message
 Astrobytes: when?
 eulerscheZahl: beginning of contest
 Astrobytes: oh ok, thought it was recent
 eulerscheZahl: and someone replied with "he's looong asleep" or something like that
 Nerchio: people know your sleeping patterns?
 eulerscheZahl: you don't?
 Astrobytes: Everyone knows Old Man Eulers sleeping patterns
 Nerchio: not yet 
 eulerscheZahl: in summer i need less sleep. so i stay up until around 9:30pm
 eulerscheZahl: in winter i go to bed earlier
 Astrobytes: There's a Summer, Winter and GotTimeOff pattern
 eulerscheZahl: and toads hibernate
 eulerscheZahl: GotTimeOff = active during office hours under the week
 Astrobytes: under? During?
 eulerscheZahl: while hitting enter i thought the same
 Astrobytes: Should be during.
 eulerscheZahl: but writing "during" twice is bad style&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 struct: 85% win rate
 struct: if this isnt better
 struct: i dont know
 IvesL: for the cards that wont go back to board or non-permanent, where are they after being played?
 eulerscheZahl: but is is submit worthy?
 struct: I submit usually when its above 60
 eulerscheZahl: these cards are in card heaven
 eulerscheZahl: looking down at you from a cloud
 IvesL: sorry, dumb question just found PLAYED_CARDS
 eulerscheZahl: technical debt would go to hell. so it's lucky it can't get automated
 Astrobytes: euler: out of curiosity, would you say wahrend (wth an umlaut) or im laufe in that context?  
 Illedan: Ahhh, nothing works -.-
 eulerscheZahl: both works
 eulerscheZahl: or just "unter der Woche"
 eulerscheZahl: now you know where i got the "under" from
 Scarfield: unter den Linden
 eulerscheZahl: rookie mistake, translating work me word
 _Royale: CG should use this for seed generation: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand</a> :grinning:
 Astrobytes: similar in English, you could say through the week, over the week, over the course of the week etc etc
 Astrobytes: _Royale: that's awesome
 _Royale: yeah never heard of it before I though it was awesome too&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: i would prefer <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/221/">https://xkcd.com/221/</a>
 Scarfield: xD
 _Royale: :joy:
 Astrobytes: I think you can find 'production' code like that on dailywtf :D
 eulerscheZahl: that reminds me of a story actually. but i doubt that i can find it again
 Sheeesh---: val and bow are on a different league
 Scarfield: ko-vi on the way i see :muscle:
 Illedan: Legend is no fun. There is nothing more to see
 eulerscheZahl: i randomly drifted in the upper half again
 eulerscheZahl: either bots are too close in strength (except from the top few) or the randomness is too strong to filter out the differences
 kovi: please...
 Scarfield: :pray:
 Nerchio: looking good kovi
 Scarfield: whats the boss score?
 Nerchio: hope its not a curse
 kovi: 0.14
 eulerscheZahl: boss at 29.7
 eulerscheZahl: cgstats knows<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/green-circle/kovi">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/green-circle/kovi</a>
 kovi: lost vs. boss around 96%
 eulerscheZahl: painful
 eulerscheZahl: but you'll get there. you can probably just sit it out
 kovi: yeah, that is the plan
 kovi: 0.01
 Astrobytes: oof
 kovi: 0.00
 Scarfield: :tada:
 kovi: nope im below
 jacek: stupid boss eh
 Scarfield: :upside_down_tada:
 Astrobytes: back in yer box boss jacek :P
 Scarfield: jacek in the box xD never realised
 jacek:&#160;:(
 struct: grats
 struct: wait what
 struct: you were above him for a second
 struct: I saw it
 struct: o.o
 Scarfield: now you are just trolling :p
 struct: maybe he had pending battles
 struct: it was
 struct: lol
 Illedan: We should close Legend at 30 people. Enough now
 Astrobytes: aw shush :D
 Scarfield: why not just 1, one bot to rule them all
 Illedan: That was the first boss
 Illedan: Noone liked that
 Astrobytes: InfiniWalaBoss
 Illedan: Do I need to download a game to view the Game summary? Or is there a way in the browser?
 Illedan: Without dev tools
 jacek: i said youll miss wala boss
 Astrobytes: Print screen and crop -&gt; text -&gt; yeah, no :D
 Illedan: They wanted Yurkov first :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bowwowforeach.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/05/03/165011">https://bowwowforeach.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/05/03/165011</a>
 eulerscheZahl: "Log acquisition button"
 eulerscheZahl: i like the idea
 kovi: either me or realbeef
 eulerscheZahl: or the boss
 IvesL: interesting, so in silver the boss disqualify himself
 Astrobytes: therealkovijacekbeef
 kovi: i have bad stat vs. the-realbeef. i may resubmit after he catapults
 eulerscheZahl: the silver boss has some timesouts
 Scarfield: the real Kobe beef
 eulerscheZahl: it's the code from a player like you and me. not a big deal
 eulerscheZahl: there al beef
 Scarfield: lol
 Astrobytes: I was thinking this too Scarfield
 Astrobytes: I cannot believe you read it like that euler
 eulerscheZahl: i did
 Astrobytes: Actually, I think I can
 j4at: Obvious strategies that no one using in green circle are peeking at the opponent's hand and hiding cards. Thank me later&#160;:)
 Scarfield: "they are all beef"
 kovi: he is also 0.0 now below
 kovi: and gone, im close
 Nerchio: seems to be above on cg stats
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl "Log acquisition button"?
 eulerscheZahl: congrats
 kovi: me2, yay
 eulerscheZahl: beef and kovi both promoted
 kovi: thx
 Nerchio: gratz kovi
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 eulerscheZahl: you have to translate the page first ille
 eulerscheZahl: 31 in legend. getting a bit crowded
 Astrobytes: kovi-beef power! gratz both
 struct: grats
 eulerscheZahl: who made the push in the end? philipp?
 Illedan: 31 I Legend?!
 kovi: dont know multiple submits in top
 Illedan: Ah, thx eulerscheZahl. Looks like a nice solution
 Illedan: But that was in the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: i know. you probably have to adapt it
 jacek: :upside_down:
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: what happened?
 eulerscheZahl: 85% wins not enough?
 struct: no
 struct: it was worse
 struct: I give up
 struct: Time to delete
 eulerscheZahl: wait
 eulerscheZahl: don't
 eulerscheZahl: think about yavalath
 struct: ...
 eulerscheZahl: do you want othello to end like it too?
 darkhorse64:  ataxx, backgammon
 struct: my mental cant keep up with it ill probably just give up the contest..
 jacek: :innocent:
 Michael_Howard: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Michael_Howard: Whatever I add I can't get above 40s in gold.
 darkhorse64: ^
 eulerscheZahl: let's watch some of your replays
 Michael_Howard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/646718555">https://www.codingame.com/replay/646718555</a>
 Michael_Howard: Thanks&#160;:)
 Michael_Howard: Roast my bot - I can take it!
 Nerchio: 1. don't play against yourself :D
 eulerscheZahl: good point, i want to see you vs someone else
 eulerscheZahl: i disagree on the opening
 eulerscheZahl: p1 goes to 2, then p2 to 5, p1 to 3, picking 4
 eulerscheZahl: didn't you get the memo?
 Michael_Howard: seed=-1069764030096123010
 Michael_Howard: Oops
 Michael_Howard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/646720761">https://www.codingame.com/replay/646720761</a>
 Nerchio: yeah
 darkhorse64: which memo&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: almsot as negative as my bank account
 Nerchio: turn 1 move 2 or 5 depending which player you are
 eulerscheZahl: the memo how to open the game
 eulerscheZahl: the choreography
 darkhorse64: does it goes beyond what you said&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: do your own research&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: that's what every conspiracy theorist tells you
 Michael_Howard: I'm not hard-coding openings, but if I should be doing that I my hueristics should do it, I'll look at my priorities.
 Nerchio: that's a pretty idealistic view
 eulerscheZahl: opening and mid game heuristics are different IMO. i hardcoded
 Nerchio: and maybe a little naive
 darkhorse64: just asking if there is something available. Otherwise, I look at legend replays for info
 Michael_Howard: Apart from that am I doing anything obviously demented?
 eulerscheZahl: daily routine at 19 is a strange choice. you only want that card before you finish the first app
 eulerscheZahl: coding or training is to be preferred
 eulerscheZahl: you even take a 2nd daily in 21
 eulerscheZahl: i see why you do it. but the card is still weak
 eulerscheZahl: then you release in 27. maybe better to take some debt but automate.
 eulerscheZahl: but hard to tell. i'm not sure what i would or should do
 eulerscheZahl: what you do isn't really bad. and that makes it hard to tell you where to improve
 eulerscheZahl: or at least not obviously bad for a human
 Michael_Howard: Thanks, I'll have a look at that&#160;:)
 Michael_Howard: I get murdered in this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/646725935">https://www.codingame.com/replay/646725935</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you miss 2 opportunities to automate bonuses
 eulerscheZahl: and it is acceptable to get some debt while releasing
 eulerscheZahl: i'm off, good night
 Illedan: gn!
 Astrobytes: gn euler
 Illedan: Tomorrow is the big day
 Illedan: I have no idea how to improve this&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: your relatives come to visit?
 Illedan: More IFs didn't work
 Illedan: They are back at their hotel now
 Illedan: Was with them at the beach earlier
 eulerscheZahl: oh, big contest day?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Astrobytes: For like 5 minutes right?
 Illedan: 5 min what?
 eulerscheZahl: beach
 Astrobytes: at the beach
 Illedan: few hours
 Astrobytes: In the shade, coding on your phone
 eulerscheZahl: he was on discord during that
 US3RN4M3: did anyone do the codeforces global round just rn?
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Illedan: Phone CG experience is bad
 eulerscheZahl: i got the email that it happened but didn't play codeforces
 Illedan: I can't type text
 Illedan: Only numbers
 Illedan: The editor is so bugged when putting the cursor at some text
 Astrobytes: I hate using phones when doing anything other than calling people if I'm honest
 eulerscheZahl: navigation?
 Astrobytes: what's wrong with a map?
 Astrobytes: Google doesn't even show where I live. People get lost all the time.
 Astrobytes: *the street where I live
 US3RN4M3: is the meta just simulation?
 eulerscheZahl: that reminds me to check apple maps. the street view equivalent
 eulerscheZahl: i was transporting a pizza on my bicycle when their camera car was in front of me
 eulerscheZahl: want to see if they took those pictures
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't understand their website
 Astrobytes: the one for your brother in law for repairing the puncture?
 eulerscheZahl: another one
 Astrobytes: Ah
 Astrobytes: Delivering pizzas a lot then&#160;? :D
 Astrobytes: I got snapped fully on google street view a few years back in front of my old workplace
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.apple.com/maps/">https://www.apple.com/maps/</a>how can i see my city there?
 eulerscheZahl: do i need an apple device?
 Astrobytes: I won't even give apple the hits on their site
 jzen: eulerscheZahl You do
 eulerscheZahl: oh, then i'll never find myself
 struct: win the phone
 eulerscheZahl: Nuremberg Rollnerstr Kilianstr if you want to look it up. guy with helmet and family size pizza box in the arm
 Astrobytes: price tags look apple0ush
 Astrobytes: *apple-ish
 Astrobytes: lol, everyone's being free with their photographic identity recently
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure they will pixel it
 eulerscheZahl: but i saw you in the chat logs&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: you could play Hagrid for sure
 Astrobytes: the harry potter guy.... with the big beard? I'd have to grow mine a bit again, cut it recently
 eulerscheZahl: yes, from harry potter
 Astrobytes: I'd rather be a Gandalf, never liked the HP franchise
 Westicles: You can be Tom Bombadil
 Astrobytes: Close enough I guess :D

 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 Astrobytes: understandable
 Astrobytes: I like the sun though, I must admit. 
 Astrobytes: Just got other things to do these days than sit in it!
 geppoz: me too, mainly "taxiing" my daugheter around for parties
 geppoz: that will be my main excuse to not enter legend&#160;;)
 iggy12345: my excuse will be that I just started yesterday
 struct: My excuse is that im just bad
 iggy12345: bs
 iggy12345: oh I guess I beat wood 1 league now
 Nerchio: my excuse will be that I can't enter legend twice, I am already here
 Astrobytes: shut up Nerchio :D
 Zylo: ok, I'm pushing guys do LEGEND, first: zaurus-yusya
 Zylo: second: Zach-Leee
 Westicles: look at all the japanese
 Zylo: finally ... I had to take a piece of paper and count the probabilities&#160;:-D
 mikmak: congrats
 emh: any compressed way of storing the draw stack? I was doing draws wrong. base 9 encoding? Lehmer code? or do you just need to store the rng seed?
 Zylo: normal table: but only one table in memory changing before state and after state
 emh: hmm.. what if I have many states floating around in a BFS queue (not actively using it currently, but have written the code)?
 Astrobytes: beam?
 emh: not sure what to call it
 Zylo: only one round
 emh: BFS with a priority queue
 emh: and I keep changing what the priorities are
 Zylo: no needed: just DFS and in loops
 Astrobytes: isn't that basically dijkstra emh?
 emh: yeah could be, but I might differ from it
 Astrobytes: Zylo's DFS is the most common way I think currently
 emh: I also expand using DFS within the BFS to give my priorities
 Zylo: I'm searching whole area of states apart of training and coding from draw, but I already count probabilities of getting app (and I'll fully count this: now I have simple version)
 emh: nice Zylo
 Astrobytes: sounds like what Smits was doing
 emh: but I first need to just get basic rollouts working
 emh: the fancy stuff won't work without a solid core
 geppoz: you mean you will not "coding" if you cant get an app^
 geppoz:&#160;?
 Zylo: yes, but when I can't get app then I consider taking coding and taking  a random card from draw
 imposter_sus_baka: what is best lang
 geppoz: i tried first time python to prove a point, and i proved it: I hate it
 Zylo: that what you know&#160;;-)
 Astrobytes: Swahili
 Astrobytes: lol geppoz
 geppoz: there is a special hell for a person that gives semantic to identation
 Aldoggen: there is a special kind of hell for people that don't use indentation well
 geppoz: that's exactly the point, I use identation to beutify, to give enphasis, etc, everithing, but semantic , that is dumb in my opinion
 MSmits: it's good for teaching geppoz
 MSmits: force students to write readable code
 MSmits: other than that I can see your point
 struct: any progress MSmits?
 MSmits: not on this bot
 MSmits: I am rushedly writing a new one based on psy ho's idea
 Zylo: begin and end keywords instead of brackets is dumb&#160;;-)
 MSmits: see if i can make it work
 struct: what was the idea?
 struct: The monte carlo?
 MSmits: monte carlo to end of game
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: it's a lot of work to write the sim and i will have very little time to actually work on testing and heuristics
 MSmits: the sim from my other bot is not really portable
 MSmits: so, it's  a desperate move, mostly designed so i can look back and say i tried everything&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: use top 10 heuristic bots for MC [solved] 
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: darkhorse64 are you bruteforcing 1 turn?
 darkhorse64: full ifs
 Astrobytes: my ifs are broke
 struct: I dont really use ifs
 struct: at least for the ai
 struct: I think ignoring the opponent is hurting me
 Astrobytes: best_move = (AI_Correct())&#160;? ai_move&#160;: fk_it_move;
 struct: grats DomiKo
 Astrobytes: DomiKo you bar steward
 DomiKo: :D 
 DomiKo: thanks boys
 Astrobytes: :D
 DomiKo: with almost no heuristics I got it :D
 Astrobytes: now give me your secrets
 DomiKo: I have no clue how to play this game
 Astrobytes: eh, search only eh
 Astrobytes: I *thought* I knew how to but I clearly have no idea :D
 DomiKo: But I have to say this game is much more fun than I thought
 DomiKo: But writing the sim was painful
 DomiKo: from silver to legend I added like 2 heuristics ifs and only optimized sim
 struct: why is performance needed?
 DomiKo: idk
 DomiKo: without pragmas my agent was stuck in top40 silver
 DomiKo: with them went to top40, but gold
 struct: Ill try to figure what to do tomorrow
 Astrobytes: I can get top 10 silver with my heuristics but no further. Cause my bots broken
 struct: I have no idea what to code anymore
 Astrobytes: i'm just yoloing from this point tbh
 Astrobytes: accepting my fate as a failure
 DomiKo: just throw everything and then check if adding skills give you something, if not you know you have a bug :D 
 Astrobytes: I refactored several parts and it worked as expected, and sat at the bottom of silver. Bug Power
 Astrobytes: Fecking ifs
 Astrobytes: should've continued writing the sim
 emh: fecking sim should've continued writing the ifs
 emh: hehe
 emh: nahh
 emh: but my sim isn't working
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: you've committed to it now emh :D
 emh: yes indeed
 struct: the brute force move-&gt;release doesnt do much for me
 struct: since most of the time its under 100 plays
 DomiKo: I simulate entire game (50 turns), and in first turn I can simulate around 4000 games
 struct: with monte carlo?
 DomiKo: yes sir
 DomiKo: almost no pruning 
 struct: 50 turns and eval?
 Astrobytes: MC everything? OR with probabilities too?
 DomiKo: nope
 DomiKo: MC everything with random in actions
 emh: DomiKo in first turn I can simulate around 30k games when I used random move, but fewer when I use heuristic moves
 emh: my heuristic is slow
 Astrobytes: intriguing
 struct: so just MC you and opponent?
 emh: yes for now
 emh: trying to get that to work first
 DomiKo: struct yes
 struct: Ok I must try that tomorrow
 struct: my sanity is gone for the day
 DomiKo: I guess that isn't top tier bot, but if it works it works
 emh: in 50ms I can do less than 100 games when using my heuristic, so that's too slow
 struct: I just want legend
 struct: nothing else
 Astrobytes: Think I lost mine a few days back. You'll still get legend struct. We all know this.
 struct: I doubt it this time
 DomiKo: you can do it!
 Astrobytes: you do know you say that *every* time
 struct: Today I made no progress
 emh: I made huge progress with code but not with results today
 struct: im surprised random does so well tbh
 struct: Do you just keep the best move DomiKo?
 struct: or do you store all?
 emh: I do a histogram and choose the action that most frequently gives a low turn victory over different seeds
 emh: best move is too optimistic
 emh: it expects a good seed
 struct: I see and for opponent do you just give them your starting hand and sim from there?
 emh: I randomize opponent starting hand from opponent cards
 emh: I don't know if that's good
 emh: maybe I should try to track opponent hand
 emh: where his location and how it changes
 emh: seems like a lot of work
 emh: nahh I'll hope it's not necessary
 DomiKo: "Do you just keep the best move DomiKo?" what do you mean?
 struct: On the monte carlo
 DomiKo: its just Flat MC
 struct: you will reach mutliple end games where the starting move was differnt
 struct: oh ok
 struct: Thanks for the tips
 DomiKo: I have to do that way because of randomness of the first action
 DomiKo: and i random enemy hand
 struct: :thumbsup:
 struct: Guess Im going to copy the chat history
 struct: For tomorrow, 1 day should be enough for this
 DomiKo: sometimes my sim thinks that enemy have a really good hand, and it says that I just lost
 Astrobytes: but you win?
 DomiKo: yes i win :D 
 struct: Guess im going back to version 1
 struct: That has monte carlo :p
 DomiKo: :D
 DomiKo: good luck
 Astrobytes:  beam + variants + what else since?
 emh: I know something is wrong when my sim wants to go refactor on first turn
 emh: and then it just wants to collect permaskills
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 struct: I tried mcts, but it was a short amount of time, it required to change a lot of code
 Astrobytes: I remember a poll...
 DomiKo: idk how to make mcts work, how would you deal with enemy hand?
 DomiKo: there are so many options of that
 DomiKo: some are good, some are bad
 struct: I will just give him the more likely hand
 struct: which is not ideal
 Astrobytes: some kind of hybrid SPMCTS
 Astrobytes: perhaps
 struct: I didnt really though much about it
 Astrobytes: I'm theorizing  only
 struct: The only thing I changed for mcts was my move gen
 struct: to include all possible training combos
 Astrobytes: I mean I'm in fucking silver :D But I'm super interested to know the approaches used here
 DomiKo: for me I feel like opponent is really important and you should consider his movement in sim
 Astrobytes: because it seems very varied across the board (approaches I mean)
 DomiKo: and some early game heuristics should improve any bot I guess
 emh: oops.. I forgot to give opponent the correct number of cards.. I just threw his cards into the different piles. lol
 struct: Yeah i dont take into account opponent
 struct: I just know where he is
 struct: but he doesnt really do anything else
 emh: so he could start out with 1/3 of his cardss in hand
 DomiKo: 1/3?
 emh: sleepy coding
 Astrobytes: I thought at first opponent wasn't necessary, so beam variant or something, but it seems he might be
 emh: DomiKo I randomized probability of his card being in either of the piles without thinking of hand size
 emh: I'm so dumb
 struct: Im not even sure if my code will be fast enough, but should be easily fixable
 struct: I get around 200-300k moves atm.
 Astrobytes: I think it depends how you've approached the game tbh, either with some ready game-related heuristics and a good search or I-will-pwn-you-with-my-ifs-heuristics, 
 DomiKo: I-will-pwn-you-with-my-ifs-heuristics :joy:
 Astrobytes: there are a few of those in Legend I believe :D
 DomiKo: tomorrow will be the day I will learn some ifs too! I hope
 darkhorse64: Just catching on the chat, 
 struct: darkhorse64 TLDR: domiko uses 50 turn Monte carlo, he randomizes opponent hand at the start of each MC
 Astrobytes: + I am shit :D
 DomiKo: correct size of opponent hand is important! 
 struct: ofc randomize with correct size
 DomiKo: with wrong opp hand I was stuck around top20 gold 
 darkhorse64: just random rollouts&#160;? No heuristics for first move&#160;?
 DomiKo: I have only: MOVE 2/5 in first turn :D 
 struct: oh my
 Astrobytes: stop jaceking
 <b>**darkhorse64 throws a bag of ifs through the window</b></p><p><img src="/a/46567648927625" /> DomiKo: Ohhh, and something that Psyho sad: you can release app in few first rounds
 struct: darkhorse64 we will make it, togehter
 struct: I only release at turn 3+ atm
 struct: not sure if its good or bad
 Astrobytes: you can release earlier than 3?
 struct: my bot doesnt know that
 DomiKo: you can release even in first turn
 darkhorse64: with lots of debt possibly. Let's run my first bot. RANDOM each turn
 Astrobytes: sure if the cards are there
 struct: But is it a good idea?
 darkhorse64: psy ho says no
 DomiKo: my bot says no too
 Astrobytes: I mean it's kind of intuitive...
 struct: I think my bot starts at 2 releasing I think
 struct: not sure
 Nerchio: turn 1 is bad but like turn 3 already works for some high-debt bots
 Astrobytes: my highest silver bot limited any  releases until a certain point
 Astrobytes: but it's confused
 DomiKo: 0+ vs 4+ for me is ~40% to 60% win rate
 DomiKo: gn 
 struct: gn and thanks again for the tips
 DomiKo: good luck!
 darkhorse64: 50 turns only&#160;? For performance reasons&#160;?
 struct: I probably will do it tomorrow
 darkhorse64: gn
 DomiKo: darkhorse64 games are short, that's why
 Astrobytes: gn DomiKo
 darkhorse64: well played games, yes
 darkhorse64: thanks
 struct: I guess you just do normal eval when it reaches the 50
 struct: or something
 darkhorse64: score/debt easy
 struct: maybe also take into account opponent 
 darkhorse64: your score vs his or your debt vs his if equal
 Astrobytes: getting gold or I'm ditching this chat for good :P
 struct: you can do it astro
 Astrobytes: I win both ways :P
 struct: lol
 BrunoFelthes: OMG, i need to track my discarted cards between turns... the input do not give me?
 struct: wdym bruno?
 darkhorse64: hardcode opening, play cards when you can (check you are not preventing release), that's all you need forr gold
 struct: also bonus should be good on eval
 struct: bonus card I mean
 struct: at least my bot likes it
 struct: BrunoFelthes you get played_Cards or is this not what you are refering too?
 darkhorse64: bonus is my bot problem, not enough of them in the end so I can't release
 BrunoFelthes: played_cards is my played cards?
 struct: yes
 struct: between move and release
 BrunoFelthes: omg, i'm not using it
 struct: lol
 struct: PLAYED_CARDS
 struct: tbf this wasnt in the contest at the start
 BrunoFelthes: my calculation for the left cards are wrong
 Astrobytes: I'll try and write something more rational tomorrow. At least I have a refactored version I can read. But any changes I make break it :D
 The_Duck: on the leaderboard, what win percentage is a score difference of 1.0 supposed to represent?
 MSmits: I don't know exactly, but from experience it is 65% or so
 struct: I think 8.0 is close to 100%
 MSmits: mmh I will adjust my guess to 60% i think for 1 rating point
 MSmits: 70% for 2
 The_Duck: does CG use trueskill, or something else?
 darkhorse64: already 3.0 is a huge gap
 MSmits: it uses trueskill
 struct: yes
 The_Duck: ok, googling a bit I think maybe with the default trueskill settings a difference of 4.167 is supposed to be an 80% winrate
 MSmits: gonna get some sleep. Almost finished with MC sim, then will need hours of debugging and then I am around where DomiKo is now i hope
 struct: gn MSmits, I should also go rest soon
 struct: Im also gonna try MC
 dxv1d4wrld: Hello world
 struct: Lets hope it takes me to legend
 struct: hi
 MSmits: gn
 darkhorse64: I am tempted because I am out of ifs
 dxv1d4wrld: how are you doing
 struct: darkhorse64 for me its worth a try, since I have no improvements today
 struct: and I dont really need to change my sim much for it to work
 darkhorse64: I fixed a nasty bug so I am 2.5 below the boss but that's too large
 Astrobytes: if (it.works()) use(it);
 Astrobytes: (not an iterator)
 darkhorse64: #60 overall not too bad but I will certainly decay. MC is a gamble (nice pun, isn't it&#160;?)
 darkhorse64: :grin:
 struct: Yeah 2.5 might be too much
 struct: im even further than that
 struct: like 4 or 5
 Astrobytes: Truly fantastic dark
 struct: 4.5
 Astrobytes: *darkhorse64
 Astrobytes: (my ankles fail me)
 darkhorse64: :smile:
 darkhorse64: gn all
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: I hope we can keep all this shittalking up on discord :D
 Astrobytes: gn darkhorse64
 Astrobytes: note to self: TRACODINGINING is not a valid destination
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: ooh big thunderstorm
 Crosility: :thunder_cloud_rain:
 Astrobytes: electric rainyland
 struct: not sure if I should go to sleep yet or not
 struct: I will probably only sleep again after contest ends like usual
 Astrobytes: Sleep is for the week (sic)
 Astrobytes: It's the weekend so no excuses
 Westicles: you've got free healthcare, go get some amphetamines
 struct: not for long Westicles
 Astrobytes: doesn't work like that lol
 struct: soon you will start seeing more countries loosing "free healthcare"
 Astrobytes: Dr Proctor! I am so sleepy! Here Patient Impatient! Have some meth!
 Astrobytes: that only works in small places in Michigan
 Astrobytes: (and similar)
 struct: also if i go to the doctor or something I still have to pay
 struct: I dont know whats free anymore
 struct: we probably just pay way less
 Astrobytes: Even if no medicine prescribed struct?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: that's not free
 Astrobytes: In the UK it's completely free
 Astrobytes: until you need medication
 struct: oh
 Astrobytes: then you pay a small fee for the prescription
 struct: Maybe its similar
 Astrobytes: (not the medicine)
 struct: Its been a long time since ive been to the doctor
 struct: There is something like "Family medic" is what we call it here
 struct: That one I guess its the one thats free
 struct: But to get an appointment it takes months
 struct: you dont pay for the medicine?
 Astrobytes: No, it's covered by the national health service
 Astrobytes: The one we all pay tax into and whatnot and that they're trying to turn into the American system
 struct: well you already have 2 things in common with US
 Astrobytes: Idiotic population and crazy leaders?
 struct: Well I guess portugal is next then
 Astrobytes: (I generalise, many of my good friends are American)
 struct: This week the president of the republic said the portuguese will avoid being sick during august
 struct: There are not enough medics to cover that month
 Astrobytes: The NHS is free, completely, if you're admitted to hospital after (for example) a gunshot wound, you will not die because you don't have insurance
 Astrobytes: "avoid being sick" struct? Seriously?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: smh
 Astrobytes: ever get the feeling we're not meant to be a species? :D
 struct: not really
 Westicles: There's just way too many of us.  The big guys are working on fixing this
 Astrobytes: they seem to be
 struct: Fix?
 struct: or make it worse?
 struct: Their fixes look like my bot fixes
 Astrobytes: I would say *fixing in their favour
 Astrobytes: hey struct, your bot fixes are usually at the very least highly efficient
 Astrobytes: more than can be said for global leadership&#160;:)
 struct: There is no global
 struct: But I dont pay much attention to polictics
 struct: So I can be wrong
 Astrobytes: there's a global alright, not for us though
 Astrobytes: anyway, enough polly ticks
 Astrobytes: spent half the day in Scottish Independence rally chat
 struct: I have no clue what that is
 Westicles: Trying to get back to the EU?
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: Us Scottish folk want rid of those nutjobs in England
 struct: wasnt brexit close to 50 50?
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, but not in Scotland or Northern Ireland
 Astrobytes: Or Wales
 Astrobytes: I think
 Astrobytes: I mean Wales would probably team up with the Cornish and form an alliance with Bretagne
 emh: do skipped phases count as a turn?
 Westicles: Independence in this case means going back to Germany paying for everything :P
 struct: for me 1 turn = move Until release emh
 struct: ah but I guess domiko wanted to say 1 turn = 1 frame
 emh: yes I think so
 emh: isn't it?
 struct: I think so
 struct: since games can end in 50 frames
 emh: I guess it doesn't really matter too much as long as you minimize
 struct: if it was 50 move -&gt; release
 struct: it would be 150turns +
 Astrobytes: I would think so
 Astrobytes: @Westicles no, not that at all
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.britannica.com/place/United-Kingdom/The-Brexit-referendum">https://www.britannica.com/place/United-Kingdom/The-Brexit-referendum</a>
 emh: my sim is finishing the games at start of game at around 200 turns now when I said it's one phase == one turn
 struct: emh dont allow the player to use wait
 struct: if he can release for free
 struct: might help idk
 emh: is that good?
 emh: I have strict requirements for release hehe
 emh: at least my heuristic does
 struct: Woudlnt you want to release instead of waiting if its free?
 struct: free = no tech debt
 Astrobytes: ^ if it has no tech debt its a no brainer
 emh: yeah mostly
 emh: I guess it only matters for your permaskills
 emh: but search should know
 emh: it should figure it out right?
 struct: but MC is not that smart
 Astrobytes: how so re. permaskills?
 struct: automated I guess
 Astrobytes: Fair, Is arch overly useful?
 struct: I dont think I use it at all
 struct: I use continuous code review and daily
 Astrobytes: I found it to be the most useless card but my bot sucks so don't trust me
 struct: My bot goal is to automate bonus
 struct: not much besides that
 struct: and automate skills that are most common in apps
 struct: might not be a good idea
 BrunoFelthes: when we use and DR or an AS, it will be out of the office pile until the user release an app?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: added as a permanent skill and removed from there yeah
 struct: oh Thanks BrunoFelthes I guess I have that bug too
 struct: I need to subtract the 5 - players[].daily
 BrunoFelthes: new rules discovered every time.. they should send this value&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: I've lost my way in this contest :D
 struct: They could have added the input in gold or something
 Westicles: All these japanese guys figured it out
 struct: but its not a good practice I guess
 Astrobytes: did someone say CSB?
 struct: Yeah but I dont know japanese Westicles
 BrunoFelthes: and it will be removed from your hand too?
 Westicles: I bet someone rewrote the whole thing in 10 lines
 struct: yes BrunoFelthes it wont show in any of the cards given
 struct: so you need to subtract from the inputs daily_routine_permanent and the architect one
 Astrobytes: IT's removed afaik ah struct said it
 Astrobytes: of perl Westicles
 struct: They should make another contest next month with all bugs fixed from the start
 BrunoFelthes: oh, so, problably, use the AS is not a very good idea
 struct: Why not?
 struct: ah because its removed
 BrunoFelthes: yeah
 Astrobytes: hahah, I had such a wrong idea of how it worked that whole weekend
 struct: yeah seems like a terrible card
 BrunoFelthes: you need to balance 
 struct: since the release makes it gone its not very usefull
 BrunoFelthes: draw one more card and have one card less to draw
 struct: I cant see many uses for it
 BrunoFelthes: same thing for daily routine
 Astrobytes: daily is more useful
 Westicles: When it pops up the only other choice is usually wait
 Astrobytes: no, if your opp is taking a space you would like to be at, you can take a card from there with DR no?
 Astrobytes: (if the numbers add up obviously)
 struct: If you put this game in front of me and ask me to play it, I would have no clue on what to do
 Astrobytes: opp = 2, you want 2, go to 1 with 1 DR, DR 1 2
 Astrobytes: DR 1 I mean
 Astrobytes: oh fuck me sideways
 Astrobytes: Play your DR
 Astrobytes: and then you can MOVE 1 2
 yanamal: you'd need 2 DRs for that to be free but yeah. (since normally, you have to pay if you're one space away from opponent, too)
 Astrobytes: Yes true
 struct: and since the release removes it
 struct: its meh
 Astrobytes: that's OK though struct
 struct: only good for last release imo
 struct: maybe not
 struct: idk
 Astrobytes: could be, not sure
 struct: Maybe the MC will like it
 struct: who knows
 yanamal: Also my bot seems to use AS when it wants to mill more cards to compensate for too many TDs in the deck. but my bot is pretty dumb right now still.
 struct: what if the bug bruno said is whats keeping me in gold
 Astrobytes: Mines identifies as a rock.
 yanamal: Like, if you draw 5 cards instead of 4 cards, and 1/4 of your deck is TDs, then you get 4/5 more useful cards on average in your hand
 Astrobytes: wasn't there a discussion on this earlier? I was too busy with my Wullie Wallace stuff
 yanamal: I added one line of code and my rank jumped up like 60 places. then I added another  line and it's currently back down to where it was before.
 yanamal: I only pay attention sporadically to chat
 Astrobytes: Having similar issues there yanamal
 Astrobytes: somewhere between rank 5 and rank 499 depending on the bug I fix
 Astrobytes: Is bug-balancing a recognised skill?
 struct: lol
 struct: last bug i fixed made my eval worse
 struct: I left the feature on
 Astrobytes: I left most of my bot 'on' after the refactoring earlier because it simply failed
 Astrobytes: Fresh eyes later, I probably screwed some logic.
 Astrobytes: when your bug IS your bot it takes time and great care...
 yanamal: it's not a bug, it's a practical heuristic simplification
 Astrobytes: I am 100% cool with that definition
 Astrobytes: I mean, testing right?
 Astrobytes: OK, beer time. Wait for submit, then chill (to hippie metal ofc)
 struct: Nice a bug that happens on gcc but not on msvc
 struct: fml
 Astrobytes: there are a few of those
 Astrobytes: what did you get?
 struct: no error just different behavior 
 Astrobytes: you're not fucking avxing the thing again are you?
 struct: lol no
 struct: let me disable it just in case
 Astrobytes: remember to check the size of assumed things
 Astrobytes: that can vary between GCC non-win - anything win plaforms
 Astrobytes: *plaaatformmmmssss
 Astrobytes: Platforms
 struct: what magic am I doing this time
 struct: hmm
 Astrobytes: to condense my previous nonsense, ensure type sizes are what you are expecting
 struct: now it works
 struct: nice
 struct: I dont know why
 struct: ...
 Astrobytes: what did you disable?
 struct: oh there never was a bug :D
 struct: cerr &lt;&lt; stopwatch.ellapsedMilliseconds() &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; size &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: i wanted to output total instead of size
 struct: size was returning me 0
 Astrobytes: knob :D
 struct: and I was wondering how I was 0 actions
 struct: :D
 Astrobytes: Remember that driver banging into the gate?
 struct: How could I forget
 struct: msvc is sh*T
 struct: Omfg
 struct: ah debug mode
 struct: its late forgive me
 Astrobytes: LOL
 struct: still sh*t on release
 Astrobytes: "MSVC is shit" noted
 struct: 7ms for 1k games of 50 turns
 struct: dont know if its bad or not
 Astrobytes: it's shit sometimes if you're going for gcc as a target
 struct: yeah msvc doesnt like the bitpacked stuff
 Astrobytes: I thought you had the whole wsl2 thing set up?
 struct: it is
 struct: I can wsl and use cmake with visual studio
 struct: but I dont know cmake
 Astrobytes: ah bit ops are so much nicer with gcc, I use the linux laptop for that stuff
 struct: wsl is microsoft greatest invention 
 Astrobytes: *bit ops if you need to debug them I mean, on win - good luck
 struct: yeah
 struct: I dont know how it handles templates
 struct: since I have them aswel for the bits
 Astrobytes: in terms of what?
 struct: for example I want to access the CONTINUOUS
 Astrobytes: I mean it's compile time stuff, but at the drawback of having no damn error output 
 struct: i do data.at&lt;CONTINUOUS&gt;();
 struct: instead of data.at(CONTINUOUS);
 struct: I guess it ends up being the same
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3fd10c06-78c2-468e-94e5-62c8b8857b5c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3fd10c06-78c2-468e-94e5-62c8b8857b5c</a>
 struct: ...
 Astrobytes: not sure I see a benefit there
 struct: yeah it probaly ends up being the same
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/sWDiM0xy">https://pastebin.com/sWDiM0xy</a>
 struct: But I avoid the ifs without the template
 Astrobytes: but templated methods won't give you correct error output if you fuck it up
 struct: I never used tempaltes much 
 struct: I dont even know if this is the right way to use them 
 Astrobytes: it'll just compile and do whatever nefarious things you told it to
 Astrobytes: tricky little beast it is
 Astrobytes: why is that templated?
 struct: no idea
 struct: I dont know when to use them
 struct: :p
 Astrobytes: (what were you trying to do)
 struct: it was just to access it
 struct: I should read what templates are for instead
 struct: Im not having problems with it btw
 struct: Its done and its working
 Astrobytes: I mean I expected something like template &lt;typename T arg&gt;
 Astrobytes: t&amp;, don't forget your reference passing :P
 Astrobytes: so you could pass a float, an int, a whatever in there
 Astrobytes: as long as you handle it properly
 struct: I see
 struct: I think I saw that stuff before on some git repos
 Astrobytes: (this is a very rough sketchy idea of the whole thing)
 Astrobytes: I mean, templates are ridiculous
 Astrobytes: but for just templated functions and methods it's relatively simple
 jacek: so like generics in C#/java?
 Astrobytes: I think it might be similar jacek
 Astrobytes: But I'm not experienced enough in either to really say "yes" with a degree of confidence
 Crosility: ~ Is there a way to determine the clash of code win condition prior to joining?
 Astrobytes: if anything, it might be easier to debug java/c# generic errors than templated C++ stuff, depending on what you're doing
 Astrobytes: back to your templating struct: if you need the multiple types or whatever, make sure you handle them all and template it after, it can save time sometimes
 struct: :thumbsup:
 Astrobytes: For CG at least. I take no responsibility for people using my shit code tips in production.
 Crosility: Haha, what a nice warning&#160;:]
 Astrobytes: I'm an amateur, wth do I know :D
 struct: to late pushed to master
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: test 1 passed
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/646891004">https://www.codingame.com/replay/646891004</a>
 struct: :p
 struct: I know its bronze but is just to test mc
 struct: 38 turns seems fast
 Astrobytes: for Bronze/silver yes
 Astrobytes: For gold too probs
 Astrobytes: I don't know
 struct: nah it cant beat silver
 struct:&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Just listening to angry punk and dropping comments in my code for tomorrow lol
 Astrobytes: Finished comments. Time to Saturday. Catch you later and don't work too much struct
 struct: cya
 struct: I should go soon
 struct: I dont think it worked
 Astrobytes: Sleep on it mate
 Astrobytes: clearer head after a rest
 iggy12345: will I always have to throw away two cards in the throw_card phase?
 struct: yes
 yanamal: well unless you don't have two to throw away
 iggy12345: I noticed that if I only have one type of card to throw away, that it auto throws those away
 yanamal: yes I think in general  it only asks you for input if there's a choice to make
 iggy12345: but will there be two throw_card stages, or just one?
 iggy12345: I'm queueing up throws, but they keep interfering with the rest of my program
 struct: you cant queue it up
 struct: 1 output per turn
 iggy12345: muahaha, I got it, thank you

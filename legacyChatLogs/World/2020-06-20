 imbadpython: help
 imbadpython: how does clash of code help
 imbadpython: work
 jacek: happy Caturday
 imbadpython: i feel like im good at fastest and reverse mode for coc
 imbadpython: but shortest is so hard for python
 imbadpython: or maybe im just bad 
 imbadpython: why's the testing server so slow
 imbadpython: can we all say fuck shortest code
 HellcatArabella: no
 imbadpython: ok
 jacek: lets have coitus with shortest code*
 SomJiam: what's lang shortest than ruby&#160;?
 Nought: puts gets.split.map(&amp;:reverse).join ' '
 Nought: (&amp;:reverse) 
 Nought:&#160;?
 remi6: I love Shortest mode the most. I use Python too.
 jacek: most puzzles are easy in shortest mode
 tanmaycodernovice: &lt;built-in method sort of list object at 0x7fb103fa6280&gt;
 tanmaycodernovice: what does this mean 
 tanmaycodernovice:&#160;?
 jacek: python?
 jacek: you probably printed x.sort instead of doing x.sort()
 jacek: so you printed function definition
 tanmaycodernovice: ohh yaa
 tanmaycodernovice: there is a clash going on... have to find the common numbers between 2 inputs
 gybson_samara: opponent_row, opponent_col = [int(i) for i in input().split()] - 2 seconds, any solution?
 tanmaycodernovice: i'm doing this by using sets and stroing it in list but then a null is also adding in the list 
 tanmaycodernovice: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d46197e9-263b-4bf5-8ce5-b67dabefaba6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d46197e9-263b-4bf5-8ce5-b67dabefaba6</a>
 jacek: null? if s1 and s2 are strings there shouldnt be any nulls o.O
 Astrobytes: Good morning, happy Caturday
 tanmaycodernovice: nvm i've solved that 
 jacek: :thumbsup:
 tanmaycodernovice: jacek check dm
 jacek: darn, in othello i reached oware point. self-play stronger bot isnt really stronger in leaderboard
 Astrobytes: Ah. Time to think outside the box
 jacek: time to think in hex
 Astrobytes: :D
 remi6: tanmaycodernovice, was that Shortest mode?
 tanmaycodernovice: nope, reverse
 remi6: I see. I tried to do it shortest.a=input()for x in set(sorted(input())):x in a and print(x,end=<i>)</i>
 tanmaycodernovice: but u need to have 2 input
 tanmaycodernovice: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8a2e9a2-ea21-41d2-8d99-d1fe8f8b438d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8a2e9a2-ea21-41d2-8d99-d1fe8f8b438d</a>
 remi6: The second input() is in for.
 tanmaycodernovice: my problem was i have to compare between 2 inputs and print the same  number occuring
 remi6: There are two sequences of numbers? I got it wrong then.
 tanmaycodernovice: yuppp
 tanmaycodernovice: 1 2 3 4 5                                                                  5 6 3 2 1 
 tanmaycodernovice: it would be like this 
 remi6: I would do it like this:a = sorted(set([x for x in s1 if x in s2]))print(*a)
 -Gamma-: if both s1 and s2 are sets 
 -Gamma-: just use sorted(s1&amp;s2)
 remi6: I'll remember this trick, thanks. Looks shorter.
 -Gamma-: yup
 jacek: what about space, what if numbers are 2 digits?
 jacek: youd be crushed in QA
 -Gamma-: hm.....
 LelouchVC2: thats a risk we're willing to take
 jacek: and release it on friday night
 imbadpython: shortest code is kinda annoying cuz python almost always loses to python and *ahm* bash
 Astrobytes: git gud then.
 SPDene: python loses to python? then you need to improve your golfing
 imbadpython: oh 
 imbadpython: wait
 imbadpython: python loses to ruby
 imbadpython: my brain stopped
 imbadpython:&#160;;-;
 -Gamma-: lol
 Astrobytes: Fix it.
 remi6: That is what I got in the end:print(*sorted(map(int,set(input().split())&amp;set(input().split()))))
 -Gamma-: no need for int...
 -Gamma-: oh sorry
 -Gamma-: yeah int is needed
 remi6: Yes, it is to sort properly.
 -Gamma-: yeah ofc
 imbadpython: im solving the questions too quick i need to do captcha
 imbadpython: what a scam
 Astrobytes: It's not a scam. It's to prevent bots/spam.
 remi6: I had to deal with it too. You are probably better to take a break for a day.
 remi6: Since it annoys.
 Astrobytes: Solve puzzles or play multis instead for a while.
 imbadpython: i wanna get to top 50&#160;:(
 imbadpython: sure
 imbadpython: lmao
 SPDene: just spend that day writing code which can solve captchas :P :P
 imbadpython: avg its taking like 20s per ques lul
 imbadpython: bye i guess
 Astrobytes: Take a break and learn some ruby or bash.
 SPDene: 20s to click 3 crosswalks?
 Astrobytes: People have no patience these days. 
 LelouchVC2: Patience is a virtue
 LelouchVC2: That I do not possess
 MSmits: Being lazy is a form of patience
 remi6: These CAPTCHAs gets more difficult with each time you pass it. It probably thinks you are bruteforcing or something.
 Astrobytes: To my detriment, I have the patience of a saint.
 Astrobytes: Hey MSmits, how's things
 -Gamma-: same
 MSmits: good good
 MSmits: finally scaling up my meta mcts operations&#160;:)
 LelouchVC2: You guys still have jobs?
 -Gamma-: but even after so much patience I'm unable to solve andy very hard level puzzles
 Astrobytes: Oh nice, increasing threads or working on something else?
 MSmits: I didn't know how to have a persistent database, so i was serializing everything to a text file
 Astrobytes: LelouchVC2 Yeah, though business is a bit less these days. And I'm off on sick leave on the other.
 LelouchVC2: I see :oo
 MSmits: some of them were hundreds of mb, takes a lot of time to save and load to disk
 Astrobytes: What are you using now?
 MSmits: now I can go up to 4 TB
 MSmits: well if my HD space could handle it that is
 MSmits: Persistent Dictionary, a C# class
 Astrobytes: Can you query it like a db?
 MSmits: very nice thingy. It saves a dictonary on your HD and is about as fast as SQL and such, just limited in what you can use as keys and values
 Astrobytes: With LINQ and such?
 MSmits: i can sort of query it, if you can call a dictionary look up a query&#160;:)
 jacek: you done multithreaded mcts?
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: I dont want to use more than 1 core
 Astrobytes: Hm. I'd probably just have used a database
 Astrobytes: But pretty cool nonetheless
 jacek: id probably make something myself and complaing why this sh*t isnt woking
 MSmits: this is basically a database, it's the lightestweight db you can have I guess
 Astrobytes: Wayyyy better than a txt file 
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: I donno, I might have used sqlite or something. Less work this way I guess
 MSmits: I just used it for yavalath for now
 MSmits: yeah, sql lite was an option i found online
 MSmits: but I dont have any experience with sql
 Astrobytes: Oh you'd pick it up easy, it's like writing in English
 MSmits: i know
 MSmits: i did do sql injection
 MSmits: for the security class
 Astrobytes: lol oh yeah, forgot about that
 MSmits: but i never used an actual db
 MSmits: It has a lot higher setup overhead I think
 MSmits: setting up the db 
 MSmits: It's basically this:
 MSmits: static PersistentDictionary&lt;Guid, Guid&gt; nodes = new PersistentDictionary&lt;Guid, Guid&gt;("Yavalath Database");
 MSmits: thats all the setup you need
 MSmits: i use Guid because it's 128 bit
 Astrobytes: Well, setting up DBs for simple things isn't hard at all, but that is most definitely faster&#160;;)
 MSmits: and you need to use a primitive value type as key
 MSmits: i suppose the conversion functions count as setup too, then it;s a bit more work
 Astrobytes: cool
 Astrobytes: Well, it's done and it's working right?&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah seems too
 MSmits: i can just click it away if i want to end and it will flush to the DB on quit
 MSmits: no save/load
 Astrobytes: That's handy
 MSmits: Yeah, I'll still make a back up every week or so, because I am not sure what will happen on crash
 jacek: some people mine cryptocurrency, others make yavalath books
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: jacek, you still have two bots on yavalath? 
 MSmits: horsey is yours too right?
 Astrobytes: That's a pony
 MSmits: I guess one was minimax and the other mcts?
 jacek: oh, forgot to turn off derjack there
 MSmits: is derjack minimax?
 jacek: one is mcts, the other is mcts + n-tuple experiment
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: my failed minimax got about as high as derjack
 MSmits: I was convinced that minimax is best here at one point, but now I don;t know
 MSmits: it's such a weird trappy game
 karliso: Which player has advantage is yavalath?
 MSmits: 2nd
 MSmits: because of the switch
 MSmits: steal I mean
 MSmits: the first player chooses a hex
 karliso: Do you think it solves as a loss to p1?
 MSmits: Well there are 9 starting moves and I solved 2 of them as a loss for whoever plays second
 MSmits: the other 7 probably arent solvable
 MSmits: but if they were, then all counters to these moves must be losses
 MSmits: wait no
 MSmits: or wins
 MSmits: because of steal
 MSmits: to be a draw, at least one response to each move must solve as draw and the rest as loss
 MSmits: so in short, I don't know&#160;:)
 MSmits: there are more than one starting move that seems balanced
 karliso: In the games you lose against derjack you make opening mistake?
 MSmits: Yes
 MSmits: Probably
 MSmits: The early game of yavalath is a minefield of traps
 MSmits: one wrong move = loss
 Astrobytes: That's why minimax works better than vanilla mcts early on I guess
 MSmits: yes, it does
 MSmits: but you can put many minimax characteristics into a mcts
 Astrobytes: Absolutely
 MSmits: so that it deals with traps better
 MSmits: i don't think NN's do very well here either, not just based on Robo's result, but because of the nature of the game
 MSmits: it's hard to come up with a "overall good strategic move" when out of 55 moves or so, 53 are losses and the other 2 are some obscure trap that barely ever happens in other gamestates
 MSmits: leading to wins
 MSmits: it also completely screws up mcts statistics
 Astrobytes: hence the need for the book
 MSmits: yes, funnily, after 20 or so plies, the minefield is exhausted mostly
 MSmits: traps become less deep and the smaller branching makes them easy to spot
 MSmits: less deep because there is less room 
 MSmits: you can't set up some giant strategy using 14 hexes when a third of the board is occupied
 MSmits: blocking many lines
 MSmits: it's really hard to gauge bot strength in this game also because  bots are very deterministic. If a bot has one deterministic flaw, it loses 100% if you can exploit it
 MSmits: even if you do it without a book, you're still exploiting it without knowing
 MSmits: so that's it for my daily text wall :P
 karliso: Is your flaw agains derjack determinitic?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol, Smits Sermons
 MSmits: karliso no, derjack actually makes a bad move sometimes and my bot doesnt expect it. It goes off book and plays more randomly. So it occasionally loses
 MSmits:  I have had issues with Robo's NN though
 Astrobytes: When are you coming to wreck us in Othello then?
 MSmits: he would end at rank 10, but still win 60% or so with me as opponent. Then I added 1 opening book move and he was back to 0% We would play the same game every time
 MSmits: it's on my list Astrobytes
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MSmits: might be a few eeks
 MSmits: weeks
 haihiepnguyen: any one failure like me
 imbadpython: might have a space at the end
 imbadpython: what's your code
 haihiepnguyen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/027ba3ab-e69f-4ffc-b7e7-791de264b8d0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/027ba3ab-e69f-4ffc-b7e7-791de264b8d0</a>
 haihiepnguyen: this is my code in Ruby language
 imbadpython: hm
 imbadpython: idk then xd
 imbadpython: seems right
 haihiepnguyen: yeah it's long but i think it's right :D 
 haihiepnguyen: i don't know why it found "..." at last 
 imbadpython: that's not long
 imbadpython: lol
 Gaurav.: is the result system for clash of code slow today or is it jus my wifi 
 imbadpython: slow
 imbadpython: af
 imbadpython: i just submit and leave
 imbadpython: the test cases are pretty quick
 imbadpython: but the final result is 
 imbadpython: idk
 Gaurav.: yes same
 Gaurav.: ahh this is annoying
 Gaurav.: i came second in a coc just cuz it refused to submit
 remi6: Same happened to me, but I guess my code was less efficient and slower than theirs.
 imbadpython: oh that's not a problem
 imbadpython: the final time is when you submit it
 struct: Hello
 remi6: Hello
 tutubalin: haihiepnguyen probably you need to remove newline in the end
 DreamBox: Hi:grinning:
 imbadpython: hi

 AntiSquid: there 
 SPDene: @freeman42x STOP
 Astrobytes: SPDene, only thing you can do is ask him to unfollow you unfortunately
 Uljahn: or report him on his profile page :smirk:
 SPDene: @freeman42x please unfollow me. I have no idea who you are, and your spam is annoying
 Astrobytes: And definitely add your voice to the forum post re curse linked you
 Astrobytes: Nothing worse than clash spam
 MostComplicatedUsername: If only yinsh had a proper coordinate system...'
 MostComplicatedUsername: sigh
 Astrobytes: wdym MCU

 MostComplicatedUsername: --_--
 MostComplicatedUsername: im just going to start with random placement
 Astrobytes: Look at the columns if it helps
 jacek: trying to put me down? :E
 Astrobytes: Nah just trying a couple of things I didn't have a chance to try this afternoon
 struct: tomatoes are you also doing othello?
 tomatoes: only did vanilla mcts
 struct: ah ok
 tomatoes: don't know how to play
 Astrobytes: (sorry for all the submits btw, be finished shortly)
 jacek: ban
 tomatoes: is first/second player has advantage?
 tomatoes: in othello
 Scarfield: i think 2nd player has an advantage
 Astrobytes: Sometimes
 Astrobytes: and hi Blofeld
 Scarfield: there is basicly only 1 first move for the 1st player due to symmetry, so 2nd player has more control (?)
 Scarfield: :wave:
 Scarfield: Dr. NoBytes
 Astrobytes: :laughing:
 jacek: othello is thought to be draw
 jacek: at this level there is no clear player advantage though
 struct: on yavalath its clear who has advantage
 struct: But there  is "steal"
 codeboy69: Hi guys! I'm new here. Any recommendations on things to try out?

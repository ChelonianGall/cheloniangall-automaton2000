 RemUrs: hey, trying a AI challenge, new around here and am wondering how do i print stuff in python WITHOUt passing it as output&#160;? 
 RemUrs: print seems to be considered for output and i just want to debug :D 
 derjack: print to stderr
 derjack: there are comments there
 TheBlueBias: print("something...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 RemUrs: til, thanks
 Cyber_Loki: Hello World 
 IfIHadATail: how do i fix this? An error occurred (#73): "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session".
 IfIHadATail: it was taking forever to validate a testcase then I press "play all testcases" and now it gives me that error
 gemaaaaaa: me too
 WhaIe: @IfIHadATail I got that in my last clash too, 4 people's submissions are stuck in pending in my last lobby
 gilufin: me too 
 IfIHadATail: OOF must be server side then 
 IfIHadATail: I reported it in the Discord in the #bug-report channel. hopefully that'll get it some attention
 gemaaaaaa: :thumbsup:
 Tien2k9: i have error #73 pls help
 IfIHadATail: we all are getting it. we suspect it is due to something with the codingame server or something
 Tien2k9: T_T
 IfIHadATail: it just started happening a couple mins ago
 derjack: ovh is down. coincedence :thinking:
 IfIHadATail: is that where they host codingame?
 Tien2k9: i almost done the horse riding dual test T_T, i only have 63% in the test
 TheBlueBias: Fire again?
 GeRRy02: didnt ovh had a fire in the spring?
 IfIHadATail: ha ha I feel ya I was about to submit my puzzle as well :P
 PakSmith: Funny that the ovh status page is down. 
 IfIHadATail: really? ha ha that doesn't sound good
 derjack: dunno if CG hosts in ovh. could be some more internet stuff down
 IfIHadATail: got ya
 PakSmith: I was in a clash where you have to draw a xmas tree, counting  out the number of characters for each row. I hate those, so I'm not too bothered!
 IfIHadATail: lol yeah I hate those too XD
 IfIHadATail: codingame staff just reported"[CG] G-Rom: I just sent the feedback to our dev team, but it seems to be related to ovh outage"
 IfIHadATail: so we know they are aware of it&#160;: )
 RemUrs: you tell me actually have to work instead of coding random stuff on coding game :expressionless:
 RemUrs: you tell me I actually have to work instead of coding random stuff on coding game :expressionless:
 IfIHadATail: XD
 IfIHadATail: I feel that lol
 ESMAKING: you tell me I actually have to work instead of coding random stuff on coding game :expressionless:
 Sandborg: you tell me I actually have to work instead of coding random stuff on coding game :expressionless:
 derjack: c-c-c-combo breaker
 RemUrs: KILLER INSTINCT &lt;3
 IfIHadATail: I can hear what you typed :P
 RemUrs: i'd like a new one to show up&#160;:) just some new graphics, no need for more chars, the game was great as it was :D 
 ESMAKING: can we have a gamemode where python is banned
 IfIHadATail: XD
 RemUrs:&#160;:)) python is op, let's ask the devs of the world to nerf it
 ESMAKING: :nerd:
 RemUrs: at least add some weirdly named functions so it's less easy to write and learn ... something like .Select to mean Apply this function on List (looking at you c#)
 IfIHadATail: yeah I've been meaning to learn python but I never seem to get around to it lol
 IfIHadATail: coming from Java C# List anger me lol
 ESMAKING: i will never learn python cus its shit compared to javascript
 RemUrs: to each his own&#160;:) i like them all 
 IfIHadATail: I agree but it is just fast and quick and all that
 RemUrs: python for math is bae, javascript for hacking RESTful sites &lt;3
 ESMAKING: No, it's objectively shit compared to javascript&#160;!!
 IfIHadATail: I never disagreed :P
 RemUrs: idk man "is objectively shit compared to" sounds likea  wrong setence no matter the context unless we talk about actual shit in the toilet and something else =)))
 ESMAKING: Great &lt;3
 Thorcode:&#160;:)
 ESMAKING: A wise man (Bill Gates) once said that Python is so bad compared to javascript
 eulerscheZahl: what's wrong with .Select()?LINQ is somewhat oriented on SQL, there's also this 2nd way of writing it (which I never use)
 IfIHadATail: well I hate all languages I don't currently know at the time so there is that
 RemUrs: the naming, how does "Select" makes sense to apply a function&#160;? 
 RemUrs: as in the definition of "making a selection" would be more towards filtering
 eulerscheZahl: it returns something for each item of a collection
 eulerscheZahl: list.Select(item =&gt; item.ID)
 RemUrs: i'd think apply makes more sense :D
 eulerscheZahl: so it selects a property of the object
 RemUrs: not necessarlily, you can .Select(item =&gt; func(item))
 eulerscheZahl: but that's not the intention of Select. It has a return value
 RemUrs: it's more often used like that from my exp
 eulerscheZahl: also translates directly to SQL select if you use EntityFramework
 RemUrs: for example i want to multiply all the elements of a list by 2
 TheBlueBias: Well, Bill Gates released Windows, so I'd not rely too much on his evaluation of what is good or not.
 RemUrs: newList = list.Select(x=&gt;x*2)
 RemUrs: yeah the SQL translation is also amazing with LINQ
 eulerscheZahl: Would you rather call it .Map() as other languages do?
 RemUrs: that is a bit odd also but i said i would call it apply&#160;:))
 RemUrs: or translate or smth
 eulerscheZahl: Apply feels off for me
 IfIHadATail: I just want to be able to use ArrayList in C3 like i do in Java :P
 IfIHadATail: C#*
 eulerscheZahl: while C# has an ArrayList, you should use the generic List&lt;T&gt; instead
 IfIHadATail: right. I read it is not "safe"
 eulerscheZahl: and C# even has operator overloading so you don't need list.get(index)
 IfIHadATail: taht i do like
 derjack: forums are down :scream:
 Thorcode: really
 TheBlueBias: There's a forum?! oO
 Thorcode: yep
 IfIHadATail: yeah, but IDK why but I can't stand forums. I never really got any good at using them lol
 Thorcode: I think that Raizbro is following me
 TheBlueBias: Just a joke...Anyway, there's no more.
 eulerscheZahl: report a bug on the forum
 IfIHadATail: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://uptime.com/ovh.com">https://uptime.com/ovh.com</a>
 eulerscheZahl: sounds stupid but that logic applies at my company when you have problems with your account: login to open a ticket
 IfIHadATail: you can watch it live :P
 eulerscheZahl: oh great, my codeforces submit is also stuck in queue again
 IfIHadATail: yes that's there way of telling you to "fuck off" :P
 TheBlueBias: Yeah! Status page is back...
 IfIHadATail: progress
 eulerscheZahl: so, this peak is when they hired the guy who was fired from facebook?
 IfIHadATail: lol I'm not getting their status page at all
 TheBlueBias: No. It's down too...
 eulerscheZahl: green=good, red=bad
 eulerscheZahl: you don't see this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1vylmsd">https://prnt.sc/1vylmsd</a>
 IfIHadATail: oh yeah on the uptime page
 TheBlueBias: Not the ovh status page Euler.
 eulerscheZahl: ovh.com redirects me to ovh.de which works fine
 eulerscheZahl: just writing everything in German. but good news is that I can understand it
 TheBlueBias: The front page works well...
 WildSiphon: not the server&#160;:'(
 IfIHadATail: lol do they host their front page on someone else's servers?
 eulerscheZahl: but when did CG move there? my last status was that they switched from AWS to Azure
 fztik: is clash down?
 TheBlueBias: Or in another data center...
 Thorcode: is that get a job in Codingame true?
 eulerscheZahl: yes fztik, a lot is broken at the moment. not even CG at fault but their cloud provider
 TheBlueBias: For once...
 IfIHadATail: get a job in codingame?
 TheBlueBias: :speak_no_evil:
 Thorcode: yep when you level up you will have an anouncement
 eulerscheZahl: really? never seen that
 IfIHadATail: oh right that is not working for coding game but they can help people find a job
 TheBlueBias: And when you reach lvl50 you got the job
 Thorcode: no
 eulerscheZahl: i level up so rarely these days, I don't even remember how it looks like
 Thorcode: click at get a job
 Thorcode: next to community
 TheBlueBias: Why? I already have one.
 IfIHadATail: yeah they have companies they work with that you can use codingame to get a job with said companies
 eulerscheZahl: I still have my triumphant level 40 screenshot<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/jxJgyw6">https://imgur.com/a/jxJgyw6</a>
 Thorcode: oh I just try to figure that is that true
 TheBlueBias: eulerscheShot
 IfIHadATail: this is my first day back to codingame in forever :P
 eulerscheZahl: so they might have even placed the "get a job" there recently
 IfIHadATail: fun tiimes lol
 TheBlueBias: Of course it's true. Even got contacted once.
 Thorcode: yeo
 Thorcode: after you click keep coding
 eulerscheZahl: i only know that you can apply when you solved the CG reverse game

 IfIHadATail: Hi, my name is IfIHadATail I am level 14. Can I haz job plz
 Thorcode: I don't know
 Thorcode: click at get a job&#160;:)
 IfIHadATail: lol yeah I am garbage at coding. no one wants to hire me I know this already :P
 Thorcode: bruh
 meneerbrouwer: Hi everyone, whenever I run a test I get a 73 error code, does anyone know what that is?
 Tien2k9: i'm still have error #74 when i'm run test
 RemUrs: you'd be amazed by the level of programming some people have when being hired&#160;:))
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 IfIHadATail: yes servers are down ATM everyone is getting the same errors
 meneerbrouwer: ok thanks
 IfIHadATail: np&#160;: )
 IfIHadATail: yeah I'd probably look up to those people lol
 Thorcode: can I make a private contest
 IfIHadATail: anyways, you peoples have a good night. it is past 1am here so I think I am not going to try to wait this out
 Thorcode: pl
 Thorcode: bye bye IfIHadATail
 IfIHadATail: if you talk to the staff of codingame you can. I have seen people do it.
 PakSmith: Are we back?
 horse_3903: anyone know what is error 73
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 PakSmith: ovh is back up, to some extent at least
 eulerscheZahl: ovh could hoster has some problems horse_3903, you have to wait
 eulerscheZahl: cloud hoster*
 Thorcode: what is ovh
 eulerscheZahl: a provider name
 PakSmith: Yep, tests are running in clashes now
 Thorcode: ok thánk
 Thorcode: how can I know how many line of input?
 Thorcode: there is how many line of input
 eulerscheZahl: usually the puzzle gives you that number
 Thorcode: ok
 eulerscheZahl: like: first line is "n", the number of linesthen n lines follow
 Thorcode: if not is there a code to know that&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: while (true) { read line, process line }usually does the trick
 aangairbender: its so sad we dont have bot programming contest this time:disappointed:
 eulerscheZahl: yes, sad times&#160;:(
 Thorcode: escape fun too&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i even went to codeforces and do their optim contest instead
 aangairbender: nah, not for me
 eulerscheZahl: now i'm stuck, ran out of ideas
 aangairbender: eulerscheZahl 2021 ICPC Communication Routing Challenge: Marathon&#160;?
 Thorcode: try codewar?
 eulerscheZahl: that will be the first CG contest since the accountant in 2016 that i'm missing. even played the puzzle contest
 eulerscheZahl: yes that one aangairbender
 eulerscheZahl: if i could at least find another 100 points, i would be less stressed out
 casmith789: I only really came to codingame because of the contests. sad to see they are removed
 eulerscheZahl: for now it's just that one contest to try a new format. I don't think the future is decided yet
 eulerscheZahl: the contest page has a poll at the bottom right corner where you can tell if you like the idea. make sure to vote
 Thorcode: fall challenge has prize?
 eulerscheZahl: tshirts for top5 teams
 Thorcode: nice
 Thorcode: CG tshirt
 eulerscheZahl: last time you could choose between these 2:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img.printfection.com/18/21271/bT7r1IaOxZpPl8N/Next+Level+3600+-+CodinGame+Rubiks+Cube+-+Black+%28Front%29.png">https://img.printfection.com/18/21271/bT7r1IaOxZpPl8N/Next+Level+3600+-+CodinGame+Rubiks+Cube+-+Black+%28Front%29.png</a>

 casmith789: oh - have the levels for languages gone and been replaced by a test?
 Thorcode: nice
 casmith789: interesting
 TheBlueBias: I want a "Not a priority" t-shirt.
 Thorcode: I like the first one I will try to get it
 eulerscheZahl: the cube?
 eulerscheZahl: did you see the glitch?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1vyo9t7">https://prnt.sc/1vyo9t7</a>
 Thorcode: no
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: I don't even realize that
 eulerscheZahl: me neither, until Thibaud pointed it out :D
 Thorcode: well after that I will try for a bot hand&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: as I said: after the last contest you could only choose the cube or big CG logo
 eulerscheZahl: there were other designs in the past that you can't get anymore
 Thorcode: oh ok
 Thorcode: So I will keep use the cube
 Thorcode: what happedn
 Thorcode: there have certification too
 TheBlueBias: No more yellow sqares...
 Tien2k9: i got 100% in horse riding duals :D
 TheBlueBias: gg
 derjack: pony riding?

 Uljahn: activity may vary throughout the day
 ProgrammingTheABC: Is there a way to re-play or extend your time in CoC? Like if you didn't solve it in time but you want to work on it some more?

 leojean890: your game is cool, my eval is still depth 1 (simu) but I will go on later with valid moves generation

 Westicles: darkhorse64, I would level you up but I might get in trouble again
 leojean890: jacek it's a way to see it:)
 leojean890: not test the valid moves generation^^

 darkhorse64: westicles has too many fingers

 darkhorse64: I know board games are not really your taste

 eulerscheZahl: not directly code related, just describing a general mess
 Astrobytes: yep, same for mine
 eulerscheZahl: race condition, I got yours
 eulerscheZahl: but didn't want to delete half of my sentence
 Astrobytes: hah!
 eulerscheZahl: aka you were faster this time
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes my codeforces submits are heavily underperforming for no reason. looks like server hiccups to me
 eulerscheZahl: from 33.7k to 32.6k just by changing the random seed, which the usual variance is in +-20 or so
 TheBlueBias: Well, even French people don't eat toads...
 Westicles: you guys who make all the nice tools should make one that shows which puzzles each person has published
 struct: I think euler tool kinda does that
 TheBlueBias: Euler's one does
 Westicles: I mean solutions
 TheBlueBias: Oh
 struct: ah
 Westicles: Then you could add a macro to upvote all you have access to...
 Westicles: well, maybe not that last part
 Westicles: Actually, can you guys even see who has published what?  I might be the only one with visibility to (almost) everything
 struct: let me check
 struct: I can see who solved
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/puzzles_completion.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/puzzles_completion.html</a> for who solved what
 struct: but cant access them
 TheBlueBias: Well there's the list, Westicles can handle the automation, right? :3
 struct: he wants the list for the solutions and for each language
 Westicles: Yeah.  Like if I want to give darkhorse64 some pity XP, I could look up his list of published solutions
 Westicles: I think euler is the only one with a crazy number of them.  Over 500 I think
 darkhorse64: stilgart has solved nearly nearly all puzzles
 Westicles: right, but he doesn't publish solutions to most of them.  plus few people can get view haskell solutions
 darkhorse64: don't mess with my XP, please
 Stilgart: and don't ping me when talking with W
 MIPSTER: wasasaaaaap
 casmith789: which players does that include? only the top players I'm guessing?
 Stilgart: lvl 40 and above for the time being
 Chrisidris21: Is lua coding a complex thing to learn?
 struct: I would pick something else
 casmith789: makes sense
 Westicles: is the teads puzzle the only one missing?  everything is off a little
 struct: A lot of lua stuff is in pt-br
 eulerscheZahl: there is this one chadok bot account that will follow you if you are considered worthy
 Stilgart: you can have the list here: 
 Stilgart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/876e8aa5a6534ae06222774544fd37597227944/following">https://www.codingame.com/profile/876e8aa5a6534ae06222774544fd37597227944/following</a>
 Chrisidris21: Which one do you recomend
 Chrisidris21: struct
 struct: depends on what you want to do
 Chrisidris21: game design
 Westicles: teads and great escape, at least
 Stilgart: Westicles: for removed puzzle, I have only access to puzzle for  which I did submit something
 Stilgart: TGD is missing
 Stilgart: and I won't add it (I can, be not without leaking something that CG don't want to be leaked)
 struct: Chrisidris21 im not sure
 Chrisidris21: alright
 struct: c++?
 Chrisidris21: Thanks for the help
 Stilgart: teads just was renamed as far as I know
 Westicles: Stilgart, got it, thanks
 Chrisidris21: alright ill check out that one
 Stilgart: and I have absolutely no idea why I have so many puzzles solved in Haskell
 Astrobytes: CG did say we could re-implement TGD if we wanted
 eulerscheZahl: but we can't hide validators
 Astrobytes: true
 Stilgart: my opinion is that TGD should be rewritten as a 1v1 bot programming
 Stilgart: this way, you can randomize the input
 Westicles: maybe the tensorflow problem counted as well, but that would be python only
 eulerscheZahl: a multiplayer with 0 interaction. just feels miscategorized to me
 Astrobytes: Interesting idea Stilgart
 Astrobytes: I'm sure with a little imagination it could be reworked euler
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: we may add interaction too
 jacek: TGD?
 Astrobytes: the Great Dispatch
 Stilgart: the great dispatch, a sponsored puzzle that was "remobed"
 Stilgart: removed*
 eulerscheZahl: how would you interact?
 Stilgart: and like all removed puzzles, you can still solve it if you know the correct URL to the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: tgd-disabledsomething like that
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: that's where creativity comes in
 Stilgart: I won't leak the correct prettyUrl&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: all creativity lost for huawei. still almost 6h
 eulerscheZahl: that will be a rough night where I can't sleep and check the results in the middle of the night
 Astrobytes: Maybe you have to collect the items in the trucks or something
 Westicles: I didn't have any luck with this one
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/deep-learning-tensorflow">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/deep-learning-tensorflow</a>
 Stilgart: pretty sure you can't solve it anymore anyway
 Astrobytes: it was python2 only
 eulerscheZahl: what I see as a missed opportunity (or call for an episode 2): search raceyou have to reach all checkpoints. but not necessarily in order. CSB meets travelling salesman
 Astrobytes: Nice idea
 eulerscheZahl: i'll message Illedan :D
 Stilgart: no exactly TSP
 Astrobytes: lol, maybe it can be 'collect the diapers/nappies' instead of checkpoints
 Stilgart: approx-euclidean TSP is not NP-hard
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 Carsair: hi
 eulerscheZahl: hi, aren't you the one from yare?
 eulerscheZahl: name looks familiar
 Stilgart: as for TGD, maybe we can ask to add / removing boxes for the opponent along the way
 Carsair: yes from yare small word
 Carsair: world
 Stilgart: or maybe we can ask CG to add the feature of "1v1 optimization arena"
 Astrobytes: Make the pickup locations of the boxes a graph, then you have the added task of optimally collecting as well as packing
 Stilgart: (christmas is coming)
 Stilgart: competing for the most flexible boxes then
 Illedan: Yeah, eulerscheZahl. It crossed my mind after SR was done. As it would be a better game
 Illedan: Should be fast to make
 TheBlueBias: Not a priority Stilgart
 Stilgart: :santa: is not happy
 eulerscheZahl: but first you have to finish your snake
 eulerscheZahl: and the number shifting app
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: I wont do this in a while
 Illedan: The SR part
 Illedan: First I have to fix my own todo app. As LiteDB fails for no f****** reason suddenly -.-
 Illedan: But first, not fail too hard on Huawei
 Illedan: I'll add Number shifting above snake
 Illedan: I guess I can learn Firebase while I make it
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like a lot of tasks. you should finish your TODO app first
 eulerscheZahl: then you can also remove Huawei from the list as it will be over
 eulerscheZahl: 2 for 1
 jacek: number shifting?
 Astrobytes: Yes. But a mobile app version.
 eulerscheZahl: he already had a prototype but then stopped
 jacek: yet we have working mobile solution for :notebook: :soccer:
 Illedan: Where?
 struct: play store
 Astrobytes: the day I install anything made by jacek on my pc or phone will be the day pigs fly over a blue moon :P
 eulerscheZahl: and if you don't know that it's from jacek?
 titanshange: im in robotis clas lol
 Astrobytes: then I'm at his mercy
 eulerscheZahl: i'm at home
 jacek: good for you
 Ran_42: Im groot?
 Illedan: I'm in my good chair
 Illedan: With a glass of milk
 AymenS: hello
 AymenS: this is my first time on this website
 AymenS: trying to learn haskell
 Illedan: Nice, I recommend you to use Haskell on Fantastic Bits&#160;:)
 AymenS: how do i do that :sweat_smile:
 Astrobytes: "my good chair"
 Astrobytes: :D
 AymenS: im the biggest noob here, i have no idea what im doing
 trictrac: hi darkhorse64, leojean890 &amp; jacek, , i just validate LOA, multi is online:slight_smile:
 AymenS: im taking a university course on haskell and i wanna understand it but the course is so bad at teaching
 Astrobytes: nice one trictrac
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 jacek: :tada:
 Illedan: I guess clashes is a good start Aymen5 
 Astrobytes: in haskell?
 jacek: clashes? :scream:
 Illedan: :D
 AymenS: whats clashes&gt;
 Astrobytes: Puzzles I think :D
 AymenS:&#160;?*
 Astrobytes: I would go to the Practice section and do easy puzzles 
 jacek: temperatures puzzle is good for functional programming i think?
 Illedan: True
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode</a>I like to learn syntax in clashes :P Better to be under pressure while googling.. And the problems are easier
 jacek: uh oh, lines of action have no banner
 Astrobytes: lol Illedan, I see the reasoning but :P
 AymenS: ohh i tried clash of code, its too hard
 Illedan: Yeah, I know
 Illedan: I'm trying to be helpfull
 AymenS: thank you illedan, i appreciate it
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures</a>Solve this AymenS
 Illedan: And share you solution
 Illedan: then look at other Haskell solutions
 AymenS: okok ill do that
 miszu: I am about to do my next optimization problem which is the mars landing. Any advice before I dig in?
 darkhorse64: GA does the job
 Astrobytes: get your GA working properly
 struct: yeap I have GA on loa
 darkhorse64: on loa&#160;?
 miszu: perfect I will use that
 miszu: CMA ES the math are too heavy to implement to be worth it
 Astrobytes: I do think it's overkill for CvZ at least
 miszu: problem is to derive it
 miszu: in python with numpy, you have a method that gives you a sample from multivariate gaussian distribution. In c++, well you have to do it from scratch
 darkhorse64: lol, trictrac plays 2 matches and is alread above the boss
 darkhorse64: already
 derjack: :angry:
 struct: oh it was approved
 miszu: boss be like: alright I ma heading out
 struct: cant wait to get destroyed by him&#160;:(
 jacek: or jacek
 Astrobytes: it's motivation to work harder&#160;;)
 struct: is jacek bot better?
 miszu: you guys talking about the CTTT?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/585676677">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/585676677</a>

 eulerscheZahl: did you know that you can see who upvoted you? but downvotes are anonymous
 darkhorse64: no. Tell me
 eulerscheZahl: go to your profile page and click the XP/level thing so that the history opens
 eulerscheZahl: the API also sends the user ID of each upvote
 Ran_42: Anyone knows how the score in the clash of code leaderboard is calculated?
 eulerscheZahl: TrueSkill
 eulerscheZahl: basically you gain for wins and lose points for losses. but it also depends on the rank of your opponent how much you win/lose
 Ran_42: Is there a general rule when I win/ lose?
 Ran_42: Like if in a clash of 8 im number 4 for example
 eulerscheZahl: no, really depends on whom you play against
 Ran_42: ok
 eulerscheZahl: look up TrueSkill. but it's really math-heavy
 Ran_42: ok thx
 jacek: everything is math heavy nowadays&#160;:(
 miszu: this is why you get paid good money if you know math
 jacek: id get better money for meth
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 miszu: many years ago, a phd grad got an offer in a startup in silicon valley for $500 000 per year. He refused because..
 AymenS: thats why im taking mathematics and computer science degree
 Astrobytes: org. chem. isn't that hard jacek, go find your true calling lol
 miszu: Google poatched him with a $2 000 000 per year
 miszu: morale of the story: git gud at math
 eulerscheZahl: if you don't enjoy it, don't. no point in earning lots of money when you hate your job
 Ran_42: Did they changed it in your profile that now your programming languages says unkown level instead of how many puzzles you solved?
 miszu: my bad, it was 3 millions
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/a-google-programmer-blew-off-a-500000-salary-at-startup-because-hes-already-making-3-million-every-year-2014-1">https://www.businessinsider.com/a-google-programmer-blew-off-a-500000-salary-at-startup-because-hes-already-making-3-million-every-year-2014-1</a>
 miszu: yeah do what you love
 eulerscheZahl: interesting Ran_42, almost looks like a bug to me
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes have a look at Ran_42's profile. what do you think?
 casmith789: yes they did, you can now do language tests instead if you click on it
 casmith789: I think that's deliberate
 Ran_42: ye yesterday it wanst like it
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, my profile too
 eulerscheZahl: nevermind then
 Ran_42: :p its not a bug its a feature
 casmith789: I don't know if it gets updated if you do one of the language tests but I assume so
 eulerscheZahl: i'll remain at unknown level then, no time nor motivation for that stuff
 Astrobytes: Someone else mentioned this earlier
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want the "certifications" either
 Astrobytes: I couldn't care less so didn't bother looking
 eulerscheZahl: they didn't exist when I clicked the quest map, was a mistake to click there in hindsight
 Ran_42: why?
 casmith789: what is the quest map path for speed, is it just more and more clashes required? that path is long and I almost want to do 50 to find out what is next
 eulerscheZahl: just adds clutter and gives a false impression that makes me look more skilled than i really am
 Ran_42: how do you know that much proggraming languages I know it all similar but its crazy&#160;:)
 jacek: says the guy who has participation basge
 eulerscheZahl: it's just some educated guessing and a bit of google
 eulerscheZahl: and i only did the easy ones in the more obscure languages
 Ran_42: ye makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: that's an ironic badge to make a bad profile page worse
 Ran_42: "Groovy"
 eulerscheZahl: the coolest thing about Groovy is the name
 Ran_42: lol
 eulerscheZahl: can't ICPC just end?&#160;:(
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: "groovy" just makes me think of Evil Dead
 Ran_42: they should add the best language -
 Ran_42: buffalo

 jacek: graph games?
 Ran_42: where is this graph marathon

 jacek: routing challenge? like the one from ovh this morning?
 d7oom: :rage:
 mrfacysus: eulerscheZahl, wouldn't you want &gt;99% on all languages tho?
 struct: is cg stats multi list updated daily?
 jacek: darkhorse64 has the same number of points as boss :thinking:
 darkhorse64: make an educated guess
 Scarfield: chance?
 eulerscheZahl: no mrfacysus, i have other priorities
 eulerscheZahl: mostly i'm just idling here on chat outside of contests. real contests I mean
 StyllyMyle: Hey guys
 eulerscheZahl: struct you can manually enter the game in the URL
 struct: thanks euler
 StyllyMyle: can someone give me link for coding game api documentation?
 eulerscheZahl: there is no official documentation
 eulerscheZahl: there is:
 StyllyMyle: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/api-access-with-python">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/api-access-with-python</a>
 StyllyMyle: not this xD
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/7QjzB15.png">https://i.imgur.com/7QjzB15.png</a>
 struct:&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: was about to link that one StyllyMyle but you beat me on it
 eulerscheZahl: and also <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pypi.org/project/codingame/">https://pypi.org/project/codingame/</a>
 StyllyMyle: Yea i saw that already
 eulerscheZahl: cgstats has a dark mode? or some browser extension?
 StyllyMyle: but dont need it, becz it has common stuff, I wanted to start clash of code and do stuff
 ipsissimus: programmers prefer dark modes 
 ipsissimus: because light attracts bugs
 StyllyMyle: but neverthless thank you eulersche :DD
 Astrobytes: StyllyMyle: If you want to start automating clash of codes or something then that's a fast way to a ban
 StyllyMyle: Lol I am not automating my account
 StyllyMyle: using bot account to create links for clashes
 StyllyMyle: and then inviting my main or others
 Astrobytes: Ah there's something for that
 StyllyMyle: Wait there is?
 eulerscheZahl: some twitch streamer did that
 StyllyMyle: Ooooohhh
 eulerscheZahl: #clash
 StyllyMyle: discord bot?
 StyllyMyle: xDD
 StyllyMyle: Nice 
 StyllyMyle: people really are genius 
 Astrobytes: Details are on discord or in forum, can't remember where it is
 StyllyMyle: ooohh
 eulerscheZahl: there used to be a bot on CG chat too. but looks inactive recently so no more chat history
 Astrobytes: (I don't clash or I might know)
 Astrobytes: just ask around
 eulerscheZahl: i muted the clash channel on discord
 Astrobytes: discord has a clash channel? :innocent:
 StyllyMyle: I see
 StyllyMyle: thank you all, gotta see what i can do now xD
 eulerscheZahl: now a random change helped. now i have to stay up to spam more seeds with it. damn contest
 struct: how much did it help?
 eulerscheZahl: +24 points
 eulerscheZahl: not bad considering how close it all is
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes a thing doesn't work. then you change your code somewhere else and try the previous change again in combination. and then suddenly it does help
 LagunaElectric: yep
 jacek: teapot pwned in the league
 darkhorse64: Do not make me angry or I make the boss stronger
 struct: :zipper_mouth:
 darkhorse64: :wink:
 mrfacysus: eulerscheZahl what would you say makes you improve the most coding wise?
 ChubbsMcFly: I'm a bit confused, I'm trying out this "Coders Strike Back". I'm on the level where you get BOOST, and I beat the boss but it's not letting me advance to the next level. Not sure what else to do?
 Astrobytes: mrfacysus: you won't find Old Man Euler online at this time
 mrfacysus: Astrobytes oh well, what would your answer be kind sir
 darkhorse64: ChubbsMcFly: you have to run your code in the arena
 ChubbsMcFly: I have a few times ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 ChubbsMcFly: Do I have to beat a certain number or&#160;% of people in the arena?
 darkhorse64: You have to be ranked above the boss at the end of the run to access the next level
 ChubbsMcFly: It's showing the boss as ranked above EVERYONE. I see "Dereda" as rank 1, and then above him is "Boss 3" with an empty box to the left
 Astrobytes: mrfacysus: Practice above all else, but not just coding, logic above all
 Ran_42: What do you mean by logic?
 Ran_42: solving puzzles efficiently?
 darkhorse64: Then, your bot is not strong enough
 ChubbsMcFly: Even tho I beat the boss when I hit `PLAY MY CODE`?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 darkhorse64: PLAY MY CODE tests your bot in a single game against the player of your choice
 Astrobytes: Ran_42: learning a little formal logic goes a long, long way imo
 Ran_42: A lot of what I know is self thought, what do you mean by formal logic?
 Astrobytes: Ran_42: rather than flooding chat with definitions I refer you here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic</a>
 Ran_42: Ok ty
 Astrobytes: It's worth doing first-order logic at the very least imo
 Ran_42: I will defintly check it out
 Astrobytes: I'm also mostly self taught but I did cover this in a foundation mathematics for computer science course
 Astrobytes: And it helped a lot
 Ran_42: nice I learnt boolean algebra and solve problems in project euler to improve my math thinking
 Astrobytes: yep, do some first-order logic stuff, then maybe proofs if you don't know those, I also recommend relational algebra, it depends on what you need or want to learn. Lots of discrete maths topics are very useful
 Ran_42: Ok thanks&#160;:)
 Ran_42: just a few days ago I learnt about mathematical induction in number theory which sound super useful
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's one type of proof. Can be very useful indeed. Regarding number theory, it is something I should improve tbh, it's 'on my list' :P
 Ran_42: ye same
 Ran_42: so much things to learn :p
 Astrobytes: It's a journey of knowledge&#160;:)
 leojean890: Astrobytes did you push me&#160;?
 leojean890: still have depth 1 algo
 Astrobytes: possibly, didn't look tbh"
 Astrobytes: *tbh
 leojean890: but I'm the last of W1 now^^
 Astrobytes: Still &gt; Wood 2&#160;:)
 leojean890: when I pushed our winrates were close (just behind the boss) and then did you push again
 leojean890:&#160;?
 leojean890: yes &gt; W2
 leojean890: hopefully
 leojean890: maybe I will develop legal moves computation and pass the same eval depth 2 or 3 ^^
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I changed eval a bit
 Astrobytes: (for 2nd submit)
 darkhorse64: I did that too. Now, I need to write a real bot
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: Not a bad bot though I have to say
 leojean890: same, I improved my eval while removing a feature :P
 Astrobytes: that counts as adding a feature right? :P
 leojean890: I just minimize the sum of dists between my pawns and that's it xD
 leojean890: and I reckognize win when a bfs says me so&#160;:)
 leojean890: my eval depth 1 is only that
 leojean890: not very bad^^
 leojean890: depth 2 or 3 I can change that considering the adv pawns
 leojean890: depth 1 when I consider adv pawns my eval is less strong
 Astrobytes: there are squares on the board that are nice to be on
 Astrobytes: or close to
 leojean890: the middle to improve the chances to regroup pawns&#160;?:)
 Astrobytes: :zipper_mouth:
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 leojean890: I ddin't take into account the pawns positions for the moment
 Astrobytes: I'm gonna do a rewrite sometime this year
 leojean890: mcts&#160;? :P
 leojean890: I didn't finish any mcts for the moment :P
 Astrobytes: no I'll stick with alphabeta for this
 leojean890: I'm everywhere with eval, for each multi^^
 Astrobytes: You would enjoy MCTS-EPT
 leojean890: I think that it can make me climb a little for some multis
 leojean890: like UTTT, connect 4 .. maybe clobber
 leojean890: but I have to learn how to do good perfs with C++^^
 leojean890: else mcts is average
 leojean890: MCTS-EPT&#160;? is that a variant&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, EPT = early playout termination
 Astrobytes: So you eval at depth n
 leojean890: I see:)
 Westicles: Huh, didn't know you can see who upvoted you
 Astrobytes: rather than a full playout
 leojean890: sometimes it may work better yes
 leojean890: if the eval is good:)
 Astrobytes: Westicles: yeah that's known for a long while, surprised you didn't know that one
 Westicles: Oh, not on contribs though
 leojean890: I eval depth N for minmax, bfs, beam search.. never tried with MCTS&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: leojean890: Any place you have a good alphabeta eval it's worth considering to try EPT
 leojean890: and I do rarely GA/SA
 leojean890: only for some puzzles and optims
 leojean890: never with multis for the moment
 Astrobytes: Oware: depth 0 MCTS EPT
 leojean890: I see, indeed I could try that (and mcts!)
 leojean890: depth 0?:P
 leojean890: still didn't read playgrounds about oware, I heard there are interesting ones:)
 Astrobytes: well, depth 1 as in 1 play
 leojean890: seems to be instant eval after simu:P
 Astrobytes: yes
 leojean890: my LOA-like
 leojean890: ^^
 Astrobytes: You still build a tree though
 leojean890: idem my atari-go :p
 leojean890: for the mcts part&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It's a full MCTS but instead of simulating til the end you just eval after a move
 Astrobytes: (or n moves, very much game-specific)
 Astrobytes: Works well on Breakthrough and a few other board games afaik 
 leojean890: only a move is less strong, no&#160;?
 leojean890: for BT I believe you
 leojean890: because too long fames
 leojean890: games
 leojean890: maybe going to depth 10 or 20 with eval is stronger
 leojean890: than 100 or more&#160;:) 
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's why I say (or n moves, very much game-specific)
 Astrobytes: *said
 leojean890: the branching is big and the total depth too, so stats are maybe incomplete if you go till the end
 leojean890: (not enough branches crossed)
 leojean890: but with a good eval..^^
 Astrobytes: it's essentially a kind of pruning really
 leojean890: it's hard to eval correctly BT
 leojean890: yes you can prune with an eval
 leojean890: some people did that well for SC2021
 leojean890: top 10 MCTS
 Astrobytes: BT is a tough game indeed, and a fun one
 leojean890: BT, I have an easy eval depth 2 now
 leojean890: but I'm like 72th
 Astrobytes: I can't even remember what the SC2021 was lol
 leojean890: so need maybe to find better&#160;:)
 leojean890: SC2021 was totoro :P
 Astrobytes: I was 20th in BT
 leojean890: better than futureFC2021 of course xD
 Astrobytes: Ah right, the tree thing
 leojean890: yes^^
 leojean890: it was a mcts fight as the top^^
 leojean890: but doing good evals in BT with MCTS EPT is surely hard to do:)
 Astrobytes: ugh, now 22nd in BT, I must improve
 leojean890: gg
 leojean890: better eval than mine, it's sure:p
 Astrobytes: Well, that's my alphabeta, apply that to EPT
 Astrobytes: *MCTS EPT
 leojean890: which depth&#160;?
 leojean890: do you use iterative deepening&#160;?
 Astrobytes: it's iteratively deepening yes
 leojean890: yes you can change and choose EPT with the same eval
 Astrobytes: with move ordering based on that
 leojean890: oh nice, move ordering to find better moves
 Astrobytes: I'm lazy to rewrite
 leojean890: with higher depth
 leojean890: my eval is too simple
 leojean890: that's why it doesn't work so great
 leojean890: you can just keep the N best actions when you iterative deepen
 Astrobytes: my eval is a mess, but it works OK
 leojean890: for ex the 3 best actions of depth 5 are kept to simulate until 6, you earn time a little :p
 leojean890: sounds like my COK eval xD
 Astrobytes: Hmm, not quite, but you at least order them in order of best score, alphabeta takes care of the pruning
 leojean890: 300 lines eval mdr
 leojean890: my cok is a huge mess
 leojean890: I'm around 50th gold I think with that..
 AntiSquid: man these acronyms ...
 leojean890: I see what you mean, with move ordering, you earn time with the pruning
 Astrobytes: mines not quite that large! (CoK) I was about 90th in gold last I checked? Just heuristics with a lookahead on 1 or 2 things iirc
 leojean890: COK is not understandable by everyone I believe you&#160;:)
 leojean890: code of kutulu for people who don't know :P
 Astrobytes: (lol, my CoK is not large)
 Astrobytes: awesome
 Astrobytes: I did not spot that before I wrote it
 leojean890: I see:) I'm depth 2 with heuristics
 leojean890: (== eval)
 leojean890: using a voronoi and other stuff
 leojean890: taking really 300 lines
 Astrobytes: I don't have a voronoi but I have various tile scoring heuristics iirc
 Astrobytes: Been a while since I looked at it tbh
 leojean890: all my heuristics are based on my distance from ennemies/players/health recuperation areas/short ways
 leojean890: this game is one opportunity to try smitsi^^
 Astrobytes: yeah, pretty much the same, with some spells/effects thrown in
 Astrobytes: Hm
 Astrobytes: I donno, he doesn't recommend it iirc
 leojean890: my uses of spells are not great
 leojean890: except maybe health areas
 leojean890: "plans"
 leojean890: but light and yell I didn't implement them correctly, I could do that..
 Astrobytes: I *have* to rewrite this, the code is actually disgusting
 leojean890: like most of my codes^^
 leojean890: (on CG I mean xD)
 Astrobytes: ~780 lines of duplication, code smells, bad practice, mistakes, sheer idiocy lol
 leojean890: I often do that here as well:)
 leojean890: or too long functions:)
 leojean890: too much fors imbricated
 Astrobytes: hehehe, it happens
 Astrobytes: Especially under time pressure
 leojean890: in cg yes^^
 leojean890: at work I don't do that xD
 Astrobytes: hahaha, a quick road to unemployment I think :D
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out for tonight, good to see you again, been a while!
 leojean890: yes D
 leojean890: XD
 leojean890: some companies prefer code quick and dirty and mass productivity xD
 leojean890: but some prefer maintenable clean code^^
 leojean890: =&gt; deliver fast or clean^^
 leojean890: good night:)
 leojean890: yes been a while I should come discuss more often:p
 Astrobytes: hah, I know what I prefer lolI've not been so active recently anyway tbh, feeling a bit more motivated this week though!bn&#160;:)
 leojean890: I go more often on FR and I go not often on CG those times^^'
 leojean890: activity depends on what time you have:)
 leojean890: while quarantaine you have more time^^'
 slazure: hi
 Wontonimo: hi slazure :wave:
 Wontonimo: what brought you here salzur?
 slazure: new
 slazure: noone
 slazure: by myself
 KalamariKing: interesting hypothesis
 WhoTho: agree
 Wontonimo: who you?
 gemaaaaaa: what is up people
 KalamariKing: not much, redoing old puzzles and seeing how horrible the code was
 Frost_Child: hey, I just got started and know basically nothing about code. Where do I begin in this site?
 KalamariKing: codingame isnt exactly geared towards beginners, but there's tutorials and such online to help you learn the concepts needed to solve the first easy practices
 Frost_Child: Ah, gotcha
 KalamariKing: old me was *really* stupid
 Frost_Child: Cant  be any worse than me. My code is literally timing out
 Frost_Child: on the easiest puzzle
 zzvcc: @Frost_Child I recommend codeacademy to start 
 NoobDevSayswhat: Hi guys! I need some help with the pod racing game, anyone can give me a hand? I'm really a beginner and I feel my if statements are not being considered since the pod is not slowing according to angle or distance... any idea what can I be missing? 
 NoobDevSayswhat: nvm I think I have an idea
 struct: NoobDevSayswhat did you solved it?

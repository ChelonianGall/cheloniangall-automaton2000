 niluthebear: yes
 Uljahn: ye, "MOVE 8 8 3" is wrong
 GrandReclaimer: huh I see, thanks!
 GrandReclaimer: Im not too sure what could be causing it.  It looks like all my factories go neutral at the end? 
 GrandReclaimer: Is there a way for me to check if its valid before sending? 
 Uljahn: check the source and the target, isn't it obvious?
 GrandReclaimer: I guess not for someone who is learning

 eulerscheZahl: Automaton2000 help
 Automaton2000: i started with c++ and i am sure you can
 niluthebear: Automaton2000 why clash is hard&#160;?
 Automaton2000: that depends on the type of game
 niluthebear: yes
 jacek: Automaton2000 i started with basic
 Automaton2000: what happens if you try to do both
 Shrimpster: In MCTS yall take the most visited node right? Or the highest avg? 
 eulerscheZahl: most visited. but shouldn't make a difference as you will visit the node with a higher score more often
 Shrimpster: okk ty ^.^ 
 DomiKo: what is this why CSB is called "MAD POD RACING"???
 Shrimpster: CSB? As in Cool story bro? 
 TheBlueBias: In memory of MK. LIA

 eulerscheZahl: one will something maybe
 Rosheed: what the heal
 TheBlueBias: dont and havent are pretty big too, negaField
 eulerscheZahl: when I generated these plot, at first I did on just 1 day. looked so random that I had to verify by hand as I couldn't believe it

 TimothyAlexisVass: Why?
 eulerscheZahl: chinese cat?
 Scarfield: nice, i dont know that movie though astro&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Watch it
 Astrobytes: They remade it this year, I won't watch that. The 2018 Danish original is absolutely outstanding
 Astrobytes: I don't think I've ever been on the edge of my seat from the start to the end of a movie before.
 Rosheed: oh ok
 Astrobytes: Stayed up till 4am cause I couldn't not watch the rest of it
 Scarfield: nice will check it out, Jakob Cedergren is usually great
 Astrobytes: He is absolutely stellar.
 Rosheed: i have check it
 Scarfield: "Don't" be mean TheBlueBias, i "haven't" done anything to you :p
 Scarfield: Astrogren
 Astrobytes: Cederfield
 Astrobytes: WTAF is Line Racing?
 Astrobytes: Ohhh tron
 Astrobytes: MPR is just not as eloquent as CSB
 Scarfield: Line Racing?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, they renamed Tron as well as CSB
 Nilukumar: hey kitkat
 Scarfield: o0
 Nilukumar: gavin hand
 TheBlueBias: codepad want cg, not their copyrigth infractions. :smirk:
 Nilukumar: copyright
 DomiKo: why they are renaming multis&#160;:((
 Astrobytes: copyright issues DomiKo
 eulerscheZahl: they did already?
 TheBlueBias: Did you read my messages?! :rollin_eyes:
 Scarfield: tron makes sense, but why csb?
 DomiKo: that's because of merge?
 eulerscheZahl: but it's a good sign that they invest time in that and don't just take it down
 Astrobytes: Maybe, not sure, Thibaud mentioned it a while ago
 eulerscheZahl: the copyright discussion popped ...
 eulerscheZahl: damn you Astrobytes
 Scarfield: also Den Skyldige is available for stream on the DK national TV distributer&#160;:)
 Nilukumar: hiii. I am new.
 Astrobytes: :D
 TheBlueBias: (╯°□°)╯︵ oʞıɯoᗡ
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Nice! I have a feeling you'll enjoy it
 Astrobytes: afk for a wee bit
 eulerscheZahl: "mad pod racing", looks like they went with the squiddy nonsense suggestions
 eulerscheZahl: but API still uses the old names
 TheBlueBias: They love nonsense
 Scarfield: its a nice easter egg for MK to notice eventually
 TheBlueBias: Who's MK again?
 Makea84: Hi, is there a way to create a private league for a game?
 Scarfield: Mila Kunis?
 niluthebear: Makea84  private clash you mean&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i suggested to rename "game of drones" to "drone wars"thus changing the reference from "game of thrones" to "clone wars" and not making it any better. I hope they got the joke and don't rename it that way
 Makea84: niluthebear, i want to create a group of user to create a tournament related to a game
 Makea84: is this possible?
 niluthebear: i don't know sorry
 eulerscheZahl: you can upload the game as a private contribution and share it with your friends. but there will only be 10 matches played per submit
 Makea84: it is ok, i just already ask to codingame developers
 eulerscheZahl: ask [CG] Thibaud
 Makea84: do you mean @eulerscheZahi a game created by us? or a game that exists in the platform?
 eulerscheZahl: works for both, as long as it's built with the SDK and open source
 Makea84: ohhh i see
 ProvencalLeGaulois: Bonsoir,
 TheBlueBias: C'est pas faux.
 TheBlueBias: Demande leur d'être traité en tant que tel.
 ProvencalLeGaulois: j'aimerais pouvoir le dire ...
 [CG]Thibaud: english here please. Go #fr ProvencalLeGaulois
 ProvencalLeGaulois: sorry, I mismatched channels
 [CG]Thibaud: no worries&#160;:)
 Rosheed: ok
 mohamad890: can share code with us
 mohamad890: can you
 Scarfield: depends, asking for solutions for puzzles you havent done yourself is frowned upon, but after a clash of code you can hit share, and other participants from that clash can see the submitted code
 Scarfield: if you want help with an issue, you can share the particular code that doesnt work, and maybe someone will look at it and help
 mohamad890: thank you my brother

 Wontonimo: just logging on and seeing the chat about multis being renamed.  "Line Racing" oh my.
 Wontonimo: That name is sure gonna sell that multi.  Better prevision some more servers for the coming onslaught of users

 eulerscheZahl: looks like squiddy won<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/DIEeP69">https://imgur.com/a/DIEeP69</a>
 Wontonimo: honestly, I can't think of anything better.  It's just sad to see the old name go away
 jacek: Wontonimo yes
 jacek: i plan to make it functional to play against ai in week
 eulerscheZahl: you can't stop me from saying CSB
 jacek: whats CSB?
 Wontonimo: that's cool.  nice to see a multi turn into an app
 jacek: now imagine someone even ported chess
 dreadylein: i wonder why they didnt renamed it to csb in all honesty :P
 Wontonimo: it doesn't show up in search anymore&#160;:(

 jacek: and why they renamed tron battle? i saw papers saying that name
 Wontonimo: FUD
 Wontonimo: lots of FUD
 eulerscheZahl: on hacker.org it's called wormageddon
 eulerscheZahl: still better than line racing IMO
 Wontonimo: ah, CSB still says its original name in the animation.  That'll be a little bit more work than just changing text.  Not much, but it's something
 Scarfield: word art, done
 Wontonimo: or just remove it
 Wontonimo: the animation that is, not the game
 Scarfield: or word art
 Scarfield: i mean remove it 
 TimothyAlexisVass: -_-

 darkhorse64: I can understand there is IP attached to Tron but Coders Strike Back&#160;!?
 eulerscheZahl: I asked the same. "The Empire Strikes back" is the answer I got
 TimothyAlexisVass: :banana:
 jacek: oh my
 jacek: what about bender?
 eulerscheZahl: the list is longer than what's changed already
 darkhorse64: I got the reference ofc, but it's like Microsoft attempt to trademark "windows", Disney does not own everything that ends with "strikes back"
 Astrobytes: Should be safe to rename to Disney Strikes Back
 Scarfield: coders counter strike
 eulerscheZahl: we should mix some things so they can't agree whose turn it is to sue. Dumbledor strikes back

 MSmits: the * cells are the ones that can no longer be part of 4 in a row
 MSmits: I use them to get more transpositions
 Scarfield: interesting idea
 MSmits: as long as a board has some combination for these * cells that makes sure they can't be part of 4 in a row, the board will be identical to any other for which this is true
 MSmits: i guess it works best further into the game 
 MSmits: just locally ofc, it's too expensive to find these cells during a live game
 Scarfield: arrays of bit board values for each 4 cell line including each cell, if each line is blocked by opponent, the cell is "void"
 MSmits: well it can be blocked multiple ways
 MSmits: a line is 7 long
 MSmits: if there is an opponent piece at 1, it can still go from 2 to 5
 Scarfield: thats why im thinking each 4 cell line which includes a cell
 MSmits: oh ok, yeah that sort of lookup works
 MSmits: but still expensive
 MSmits: btw
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3b56fb26-7b82-4192-a951-47913ec81090">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3b56fb26-7b82-4192-a951-47913ec81090</a>
 MSmits: more effective, this is a solved draw
 MSmits: a lot of * cells
 jacek: oh my
 MSmits: you can do this for yavalath too, but because in yavalath 3 in a row is also a thing, it's much more rare to find * hexes there, so i don't even bother
 MSmits: oh and also, there is no gravity, so hexes aren't bunched up as much
 Scarfield: "as long as a board has some combination for these * cells that makes sure they can't be part of 4 in a row, [the board will be identical to any other for which this is true]"
 Scarfield: what do you mean by the [] part btw?
 MSmits: ok, say you fill these * cells with blue and red chips
 MSmits: and you do it in such a way that these * cells cant be part of 4 in a row
 MSmits: you can do this multiple ways right? Especially in the example i shared
 MSmits: all these ways are identical 
 Scarfield: ooh yea i get you
 MSmits: thats why it's a nice TT upgrade
 MSmits: took me all day debugging it though, it's difficult to get it to work right
 Scarfield: thought you meant when a specific pattern of * cells arises the rest of the board with red and blue cells would always be the same, had it "upside down"
 MSmits: ahh i see
 Scarfield: "just locally ofc, it's too expensive to find these cells during a live game" you could do it for the current board starting each turn, for some improvement from midgame and onwards?
 Scarfield: ah no, wont change anything
 MSmits: I think it's not worth it, but I find it hard to explain. not 100% sure
 MSmits: I am hoping to solve the game with this and the better solver bot I have
 MSmits: probably still outside my reach but worth a try
 MSmits: i am also thinking of making it scalable to test it for smaller boards
 MSmits: supposedly 6x7 solves really fast
 AntiSquid: oh wow, the artwork and names are really changing 
 MSmits: which one did you see?
 Scarfield: yea, missed my chance to propose some anagram names
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a>
 AntiSquid: and thor golf lost it's cover art, made me think it's a new one
 MSmits: was it really necessary to change this or are they overly cautious?
 AntiSquid: there's a long list
 MSmits: yeah but is there any copyright violation here?
 Scarfield: csb apparently is too close to Empire Strikes Back
 MSmits: but parodies are usually ok aren't they?
 jacek: space balls eh
 AntiSquid: hm i don't see any other changes
 AntiSquid: csb only has ingame screenshot as coverart
 Scarfield: tron -&gt; line racing

 Scarfield: "Discard Flex" for LoCaM

 MSmits: thanks AntiSquid will read that

 Scarfield: i mean, im all for it
 AntiSquid: ya, take your kindle to the park to read that post
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: thanks for the warning. I'll bring a coat and nightlight in case it gets late
 Scarfield: a tent as well
 Astrobytes: don't forget a flask of hot mushroom tea and a spliff
 MSmits: good suggestions all
 AntiSquid: a hammock is fine too
 Scarfield: i like to think smitsi is super gullible, and currently packing 
 AntiSquid: vagrant tourist inspired suggestion
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: I've been a vagrant tourist for a week, sort of
 MSmits: sorry was afk, could not find my bag
 Astrobytes: Slept on the beach for 5 nights in Corfu in between changing apartments.
 Scarfield: xD
 AntiSquid: dog won't fit in any bag&#160;?
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: i cant take the dog to the park, it's not safe
 MSmits: (for everyone else)
 Scarfield: too many slugs?
 Astrobytes: *for the animals in the park
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: ah cool astro, well i never done anything like that but watched some fun videos, not for me that kind of tourism 
 AntiSquid: here's a fun video&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7djcHKelc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7djcHKelc</a>
 Astrobytes: I wasn't technically a tourist since I was working but it was only temporary
 Astrobytes: lol these people are crazy, love it
 AntiSquid: ah ok, you immediately made me think of some pub coworkers (back in the day) that told me they slept on the beach in tenerife
 Astrobytes: The only issue was dragging all my stuff to and from work each morning/night, was tedious
 Astrobytes: That and I used to have nightmares about Hairy Naked German Tai-Chi Woman beating me up in the morning
 Astrobytes: (she was there for like a month)
 AntiSquid: :thinking: 
 Astrobytes: (6am to 7am, the aforementioned woman would do Tai Chi in front of a big wall at the beach)
 Astrobytes: Completely naked.
 Astrobytes: Resembled Thor.
 Scarfield: xD
 AntiSquid: closest i got to vragrant holiday was back when i went with some scouts summer camp (was a bunch of kids from different churches - religions) slept one night under the starts :D
 Scarfield: "nightmares" .. more like wet dreams
 MSmits: Astrobytes was this before or after the eyepatch?
 MSmits: also did she do tai chi with a hammer?
 AntiSquid: come on MSmits, she was doing the mating dance, you know like birds do
 MSmits: i dont look at birds that way
 Astrobytes: MSmits: don't take the Thor ref. too literally. "Built like Thor" I should say
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: blond hair though?
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Just no. All nooooope. So no it's just no.
 Astrobytes: MSmits: Grey hair
 MSmits: I think this was more Odin tbh
 Astrobytes: Details
 JFB: "Build as Thor" in last Avengers?&#160;;-)
 AntiSquid: MSmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/nPhVOZiPokA?t=27">https://youtu.be/nPhVOZiPokA?t=27</a>
 MSmits: sigh, bird porno
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgE6GwnzQMU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgE6GwnzQMU</a>
 MSmits: oh they are just dancing
 MSmits: then that's ok
 Astrobytes: The only thing better than the mating dance of the blue-footed booby is its name
 Scarfield: yea its the best
 Scarfield: im gonna find my blue flippers and go clubbing soon
 Astrobytes: There's also the shag, another bird species
 Astrobytes: Well, a type of cormorant I think
 AntiSquid: when someone makes a bird name suggestion for fun and it actually gets accepted, think that's what happened there 
 ja_fica: MSmits?
 ja_fica: different algorithm in C4?
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: I can only agree with you
 MSmits: yeah I added transpositions
 MSmits: mostly just helps to solve sooner
 ja_fica: you solve the game so soon
 ja_fica: amazing work
 MSmits: thanks
 ja_fica: previously you would solve almost at the same round as me
 MSmits: yeah it's 3-5 frames earlier now i think
 ja_fica: you use your trick?
 MSmits: the trick is local only
 ja_fica: here you use 128bit keys?
 MSmits: but i could use the trick to generate books more easily i guess, i am not doing that now though
 MSmits: i am locally also
 MSmits: so yeah both 128 bit
 MSmits: or do you mean the hash scheme?
 ja_fica: no, the key
 MSmits: sec
 ja_fica: that TT doesn't affect you?
 ja_fica: the simulation count?
 Scarfield: common shag (Gulosus aristotelis) is a species of cormorant
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ac4358fa-ca1e-43fe-9ca0-34844ae64cab">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ac4358fa-ca1e-43fe-9ca0-34844ae64cab</a>
 MSmits: this is most of it
 Astrobytes: Thanks googlefield :bird:
 MSmits: TT affects me a little bit i think
 MSmits: didnt do a good test
 MSmits: probably 10-20% drop
 MSmits: I use the same method in yavalath, but it hurts less there because the hashing is done on expansion and Y has 61 hexes
 Astrobytes: I think the benefits of the TT should outweigh the simcount loss, but I'm not experienced with TT in MCTS
 Scarfield: Im off for today, gn folks gonna go watch Den skyldige i think
 MSmits: TT in mcts is very weird
 MSmits: gn Scarfield
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Enjoy man! gn&#160;:)
 ja_fica: TT in MCTS i guess it is good for fast solving
 Scarfield: :wave:&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah ja_fica that was my main goal
 ja_fica: but you only read state in expansion?
 ja_fica: and write in propagation?
 ja_fica: I guess it is a litle more complicated then that
 MSmits: on expand i check if i already have the state and then i use the previous childindex and childcount so it takes the same children
 MSmits: so two parents will have the same set of children
 ja_fica: great
 MSmits: but this can really mess up statistics
 ja_fica: yes
 ja_fica: the UCT formula can get hurt
 Astrobytes: I was about to say that I can see how this would get very tricky very quickly
 ja_fica: because of the exploration
 MSmits: well it doesnt get tricky, if you just ignore the problem
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: I do this locally also on meta mcts and i can see the effects happen very clearly
 Astrobytes: do you alter UCB to compensate?
 MSmits: I don't think there's any way to do that. Anything you think of has new sideeffects
 Astrobytes: *UCT
 MSmits: and i dont just mean it slows things down
 MSmits: it messes up statistics in a new way
 ja_fica: what you do to your exploration side of the equation?
 MSmits: nothing, i keep everything the same as it was
 MSmits: so parents might have a lot less visits than their children
 ja_fica: interesting, it will favor exploitation on that node
 MSmits: yep
 Astrobytes: good point
 ja_fica: there is no way to actually solve that problem
 MSmits: it's too complicated to really reason about. This is mostly something you just try out to see what works
 MSmits: yeah i havent found a good way
 MSmits: solving is also interesting with this
 ja_fica: even with an array of parents and propagate multiple paths on the tree, it would not compensate
 MSmits: you can expand a node into a set of children that are already solved
 MSmits: so on selection you always need to check for solved nodes
 MSmits: because the co-parent might have solved and the other parent hasnt yet
 MSmits: one child could be a win, then all its parents are losses. On mcts solver this is automatically handled, but not for all parents, just for the one you selected that time
 ja_fica: it is definitly not an easy implementation
 MSmits: it's not, but i've done it a few times now so i know where the bug may pop up
 MSmits: the thing that really made this feasible is learning how to write my own hashing
 MSmits: i was using unordered set before. 
 Astrobytes: heh
 MSmits: yeah i know, thanks again Astrobytes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: and Marchet e
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: hashing seems like a magical unfathomable thing when you're using libraries for it
 jacek: you roll your own hash now?
 MSmits: yeah but lossy
 jacek: :upside_down:
 MSmits: so i do&#160;% capacity and then loop 4 times to find a free spot
 MSmits: seems to be close to optimal
 MSmits: usually capacity of 400k states
 MSmits: oh and for C4 you can do some pruning to overwrite previously stored states by checking with the current gameboard. if the state lacks cells that are in the current turn start board, it can be overwritten
 MSmits: that way 400k capacity is plenty
 MSmits: ohh ja_fica thanks for pushing me to nr 1. I have a lot of problems with Robo
 ja_fica: FastRand(HASH_TRIES)
 MSmits: yeah that's when all spots are filled
 MSmits: i just pick a random one to overwrite
 MSmits: so the spot in the hash table that the key leads to + random(0,5)
 MSmits: i don't know if it happens often that all spots are filled
 MSmits: it would require some serious amount of collisions
 ja_fica: I would always overwrite
 ja_fica: but that seems smart
 MSmits: this is what marchete told me to do with hashing
 ja_fica: I have a NN agent in C4, that is bad against my opening book bot
 MSmits: NN's have to be super strong to beat an opening book in a simple fixed start game like c4
 MSmits: well i guess it depends on the quality of the book as well
 MSmits: I expect if you have a perfect book and use the full codesize, it's pretty much impossible to win vs a normal ab/mcts bot that uses it
 MSmits: (I only ever used like 5% of codesize here)
 MSmits: it's different in more complex games ofc
 struct: hi
 MSmits: hi struct
 struct: idk how to make improvements on the c4 bot
 struct: I think ill just leave as it is
 struct: until I come up with someihting
 struct: something*
 jacek: any improvements in bt?
 struct: I paused, im working on competitive problems instead
 struct: competitive programming problems*
 DomiKo: O.o
 struct: im very bad at them DomiKo
 MSmits: probably better than i am
 MSmits: or at least much faster
 DomiKo: no one is good from the start
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: yeah that makes sense
 ja_fica: are you programming from KickStart?
 MSmits: though i think for the really speedy stuff it also helps to be under 30 years old
 ja_fica: or CodeJam, or CodingGame?
 struct: cf
 ja_fica: I hate getting old&#160;:(
 ja_fica: luckly im just 24
 struct: and atcoder
 MSmits: getting old is not so bad yet for me and i'm 40&#160;:)
 MSmits: just gotta know your limits
 ja_fica: I feel like im 18 xD
 MSmits: you are
 MSmits: hexadecimally
 ja_fica: ahahha good point
 MSmits: see at 40 you can be sharp enough to point that out
 Durnholde: can i somehow finish my clash code&#160;? so i can check if it would pass test cases&#160;?
 ja_fica: you can test before submit
 struct: whats the clash?
 Durnholde: time ended and clash ended automatically, needed like 15 more seconds
 MSmits: dont think there's a fix for that Durnholde =/
 MSmits: but try puzzles instead
 MSmits: no time limit
 Durnholde: sure, I just tried this randomly, didnt know it is time based and now i just wanted to finish
 jacek: :thinking:
 SHEEPGAMIN: how to clash

 MATBA: can anyone help with stall tilt in c++?
 struct: whats the question MATBA?
 struct: I havent solved the problem but  I can try to check it
 azeddinebouabdallah: Hey
 struct: hi
 ipsissimus: man im trying to do this chuck norris binary/unary conversion puzzle and idk what im doing. i thought this was the 'learn' section, not the 'figure it out lol' section :rage:
 struct: ipsissimus
 struct: you need to convert each char given to 7 bit binary
 struct: so you need padding zeroes
 struct: 1011 needs to become 0001011
 struct: and then you convert it to unary
 ipsissimus: well the first is C which is already 7 bits long
 struct: yes
 struct: Your code should work on that solution right?
 struct: testcase*
 ipsissimus: well no, its after that that im stuck
 struct: ok so after converting to 7 bit binary
 struct: you should do a for loop
 ipsissimus: i got for digit in binary:
 ipsissimus: then i need to count them WHILE digit is the same
 struct: and while the number is the same
 struct: yeah
 ipsissimus: yeah i got that, i set current = digit
 struct: that step is also right
 ipsissimus: then while current == digit:
 ipsissimus:&#160;?
 ipsissimus: but that will always be true
 ipsissimus: since the line before is literally the assignment
 struct: ok so let me try some pseudo
 ipsissimus:  for dig in binary:
 struct: which language do you use?
 ipsissimus: this what i have
 ipsissimus: python
 struct: ok
 struct: i dont know py3
 ipsissimus: i know its wrong and not sure how to deal
 struct: But can i write in c++ like?
 ipsissimus: sure
 ipsissimus: my algos are so weak, once i have to step into like 3 levels of for/if/while depth, i get overwhelmed and have no idea how to continue
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/74e67c12-f4de-4871-83ec-2372002a27c0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/74e67c12-f4de-4871-83ec-2372002a27c0</a>
 struct: something like this
 struct: ('0' * size) is like a repetition
 struct: repeat 0 n times
 struct: feel free to ask any question
 ipsissimus: yeah let me look at it and brain crunch for a bit
 struct: binary would be a string
 ipsissimus: the first line already has me asking questions
 struct: ok
 ipsissimus: if you set current to binary[0]
 ipsissimus: then what happens when you get to a new section that isnt the same char
 ipsissimus:&#160;?
 ipsissimus: like for 1000011
 ipsissimus: current would be 1
 ipsissimus: but then you hit 0 immediately after
 struct: yes thats expained in the for loop
 struct: i start the loop at 1
 struct: current is 1
 struct: on that example
 struct: when i = 1 it would be 0 because binary[1] == 0
 struct: then if (current == binary[i])  is false
 struct: it goes to the else
 struct: and adds it to the solution
 struct: and sets the current char to 0
 ipsissimus: so i need to set current prior to for loop
 ipsissimus: i was doing this part backwards
 struct: I would do it yes
 ipsissimus: and start for loop at binary[1]
 struct: at index 1 yes
 ipsissimus: ok, hold on i need to rewire my logic here
 ipsissimus: this what i have so far: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/334b6266-7ac2-4a6b-b1b1-f9cf6a89edf1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/334b6266-7ac2-4a6b-b1b1-f9cf6a89edf1</a>
 ipsissimus: hopefully this logic is correct up to this point
 struct: you set current before the loop right?
 ipsissimus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e3dbf1b7-8ab0-4118-8b46-c88d8b07f1d7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e3dbf1b7-8ab0-4118-8b46-c88d8b07f1d7</a>
 ipsissimus: yeah ill post everything
 struct: also I think print creates a new line everytime so you might need to store it first and then printit at the end
 ipsissimus: right, i can deal with formatting without issue, im just trying to get each section to print correctly
 struct: also for char in message wont work I think but you can fix it later I think
 ipsissimus: i expect:0 0 00 00000 00
 ipsissimus: char in message works:
 ipsissimus: binary is 1000011 at line 3
 ipsissimus: str
 ipsissimus: unless you mean something else
 struct: for i, dig in enumerate(binary[1]):
 struct: this doesnt seem right I think
 struct: but i dont really know py3
 ipsissimus: i do enumerate so that i can get both the index, and the digit
 ipsissimus: if i do for dig in binary[i] its just the content not the index
 struct: but this binary[1]
 struct: you are only enumerating that char
 struct: that is inside the binary1
 struct: so it will always be only 1 iteration of the loop
 ipsissimus: ah i mistyped, good catch 
 ipsissimus: should be binary[1:] to mean from 1 onwards
 struct: whats the correct syntax?
 ipsissimus: output is this so far:
 ipsissimus: 0 000 0000
 ipsissimus: missing final 1's
 struct: ah yes
 struct: because I didnt add a condition to the final number check
 struct: you need to check if its the final iteration
 ipsissimus: thats gonna complicate things..
 ipsissimus: and i still am not sure why im not getting my final count of the 1's
 ipsissimus: im expecting 3 prints 1st&gt; 0 02nd&gt;00 00003rd? 0 00
 ipsissimus: but im not getting the 3rd
 ipsissimus: ah i see why, you trying to tell me
 ipsissimus: once we get to the final 1's, my if statement is always true
 ipsissimus: so we never hit the else's that print
 struct: 1 sec
 struct: yes
 struct: you can do this
 ipsissimus: ok, i got my 3 printouts correct
 GomezJuanEfe: Hi
 struct: nice
 ipsissimus: now let me format :O
 GomezJuanEfe: I'm new
 struct: hi GomezJuanEfe
 ipsissimus: Hi :D
 GomezJuanEfe: How can I debug on the console?
 ipsissimus: i just spam prints everywhere
 ipsissimus: usually helps me to see whats going wrong
 ipsissimus: test case 1 solved
 ipsissimus: now onto test case 2
 struct: GomezJuanEfe which language?
 GomezJuanEfe: Ok, but I don't know how to run the console
 GomezJuanEfe: JavaScript
 ipsissimus: you can hit play all testcases
 struct: ipsissimus you will have problems on test cae 2
 struct: console.error("debug");
 ipsissimus: @struct ya, i need to build a string
 ipsissimus: like u said
 struct: yes
 GomezJuanEfe: Ok, I did it
 GomezJuanEfe: Thanks!
 ipsissimus: ok, for test case 2 i think i need to add zeros to get 7 bits
 ipsissimus: to the binary message
 struct: you dont
 struct: because they are both character C
 ipsissimus: i mean testcase 3
 struct: ah yes
 ipsissimus: i skipped testcase 2
 struct: you do
 ipsissimus: cuz its hard
 ipsissimus: so im trying the ones that seem logically sequential in difficulty at least
 ipsissimus: ok, so we got testcase 1 and testcase 3 solved, any single char is solved. now i have to figure out whats wrong with my testcase 2
 struct: its quite simple
 struct: so
 struct: you are currently doing for every char
 struct: you convert to binary
 struct: and then unary
 struct: but you need to convert every char
 ipsissimus: yes
 struct: and add it to a var
 struct: and the loop that var in the enumerate
 struct: binary = "";for char in message:
 struct: similar to this
 struct: and then you call your enumerate
 5922: Are you still doing the Chuck Norris puzzle?
 ipsissimus: yea&#160;:\
 struct: do you understand what I mean ipsissimus?
 ipsissimus: i do, but im struggling with where to define binary so that i can call it to add to it
 struct: define binary before for char in message
 ipsissimus: as empty string right?
 struct: ye
 ipsissimus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fce181ac-aeae-46a6-a14b-3f0b301b72c3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fce181ac-aeae-46a6-a14b-3f0b301b72c3</a>
 ipsissimus: i think maybe my second for loop
 struct: no
 ipsissimus: and everything after needs to be dropped 1 indent?
 struct: you are iterating many times no
 struct: now
 ipsissimus: yeah..
 struct: you just need a shift tab
 struct: so the enumerate wont be inside the for char loop
 ipsissimus: but also the "current" and "size" assignments 
 struct: yes
 ipsissimus: also need to be dropped
 ipsissimus: ok ill try it out
 struct: but the binary[0] needs to change
 struct: oh no
 struct: it doesnt
 struct: it stays at that
 ipsissimus: no, its not quite from size down.. its obviously nesting and too much iteration, but i gotta figure out where exactly
 struct: for char in message: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4fe1cdca-89b2-4c6a-b981-692fc2074120">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4fe1cdca-89b2-4c6a-b981-692fc2074120</a>
 ipsissimus: yeah i tried that i think, but it messes up even my first test case
 ipsissimus: oh, i figured the issue
 ipsissimus: my line 20
 ipsissimus: where i had ans =
 ipsissimus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eae050c6-6957-474f-9be7-d8949e68b702">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eae050c6-6957-474f-9be7-d8949e68b702</a>
 ipsissimus: was one nest too high
 ipsissimus: so thats 3 testcases
 struct: now it only fails the last one
 ipsissimus: but now the hard one
 struct: and I cant see why
 struct: ah I see why
 struct:&#160;:)
 struct: lets see if you can find out :p
 struct: its just before the print
 ipsissimus: i think im assuming that the last binary digit is going to be a 1
 struct: yes
 ipsissimus: and thats not necessaryily the case
 ipsissimus: so what im thinking is to check what the final char is, and set ans prefix accordingly
 ipsissimus: final char of binary*
 struct: its just an if else
 struct: you already have one in the loop
 ipsissimus: right
 ipsissimus: woo\

 ipsissimus: solved 
 struct: gj
 ipsissimus: i wish i couldve done it alone
 ipsissimus: thank you for you sage wisdom
 Jake354: lol
 ipsissimus: but srsly, that was really hard
 ipsissimus: for my smooth brain at least
 struct: just keep practicing
 ipsissimus: it put the fear in me
 struct: why?
 ipsissimus: if level 8 puzzles this difficult
 ipsissimus: i have no hope on higher levels :O
 struct: well it will take time obviously 
 struct: But im sure you will be able to solve them
 5922: The level of difficulty even in the sections can vary greatly.
 ipsissimus: ty again for the help. i will forge ahead and try my best
 struct: np
 ipsissimus: are there maybe video explanations or article explanations for these puzzles?
 ipsissimus: i cant be the only one who hits a wall
 Good_Coder: idk
 5922: You can look at the solutions that other members have submitted and published after you finish a puzzle.
 ipsissimus: most people probably to reserved to ask for help and give up
 ipsissimus: well if i finished it, i dont need help anymore lol
 5922: You might find interesting ways of doing it that you haven't encountered before.
 5922: Maybe not, though.
 ipsissimus: sure, im confident that smarter people than myself have optimal solutions with voodoo implementations
 Westicles: well, considering you don't have any brain wrinkles you did very well :P
 ipsissimus: definately good to learn that, but what i mean is like answers to questions like "why build a string to print instead of printing each section?" the answers arent so apparent until after you hit the testcase that makes you refactor
 ipsissimus: wrinkles+=1
 ipsissimus: also, i cant take too much credit, struct has wrinkles to spare
 clashplayer: lol power of thor image now in puzzle, come on
 struct: you can enable expert mdoe
 struct: mode
 struct: which allows you to see the full answer
 struct: that you need to give
 ipsissimus: wheres that?
 struct: on ide
 clashplayer: left side
 ipsissimus: ah found it
 ipsissimus: also, remember to change to dark ide
 ipsissimus: because light attracts bugs
 Husoski:&#160;:) Light attracts bugs&#160;:) rofl
 ipsissimus:&#160;;)
 ipsissimus: its how i made it this far with no wrinkles
 Husoski: @ipsissimus by the way, you can simplify conversions to binary using Python's format() function or string method.  bits = format(n,'07b')
 ipsissimus: is that better? or just different?
 Husoski: Just shorter, faster to type.  Faster and small to run than coding loops, too.
 Husoski: *smaller
 ipsissimus: so youre talking about changing the line:binary += bin(ord(char))[2:].zfill(7)
 ipsissimus: where i fill for 7 bits
 ipsissimus: with format?
 Husoski: The '07' in '07b' does the zfill; the 0 specifies '0' as a fill character and 7 says the minimum field width is 7.
 Husoski: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format</a>
 ipsissimus: so if i have a binary var: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/48d35346-417d-4621-aade-c6054dd78139">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/48d35346-417d-4621-aade-c6054dd78139</a>
 ipsissimus: or do you mean it does the conversion as well
 Husoski: That converts a Python integer n to a 7-character string of 0's and 1's that is the "binary" representation.
 ipsissimus: without 0b prefix i assume
 Husoski: Yes, just read your pastebin.  Yes...better than bin() in two ways!
 ipsissimus: yeah sounds better actually, less esoteric than ord/bin/zfill + slicing
 Husoski: Have you got Python installed locally?
 ipsissimus: yes
 Husoski: Run Idle (or interactive if you like) and try things out as you learn them.   That is one of the best learning habits I ever got.
 ipsissimus: yeah im practicing unloading JSON and CSV on the side at the moment, gotta be prepped for these interviews
 Husoski: Another good one is "don't copy/paste while you're learning".
 Husoski: By the way, struct was giving you good advice (as usual!).  One thing I'd suggest is when a problem has too many layers for you to get, simplify into smaller subproblems.
 ipsissimus: sure, googling is a skill in the workplace, but isnt conducive to learning. Im here to try and understand WHY i need to implement in a certain way. 
 ipsissimus: if I can understand why, i wont need to rely on "o ive seen this one before"
 Husoski: In this case, you can take 3 steps.  Convert input to single stream of bits, then "run length encode that" into (char, count) pairs for each group of repeated bits, then convert those pairs into the final output. 
 Husoski: Not trivial, but each is much simpler than an all-in-one approach.
 ipsissimus: i agree, this site has done a great job identifying my weaknesses and sticking its finger into it and twisting and jabbing and all around slapping me around
 ipsissimus: i also seem to run away from the learn section and hide in CoC :nerd: where its safe
 Husoski: Try this a couple of ways, see what works better for you.  
 Husoski: Writing code (and getting it working) is where the real learning happens.  
 Husoski: Also, having a tab open on the docs for quick reference helps.  I've been doing Python for 15+ years and still do that.  It's a big language with a *huge* library.
 ipsissimus: yeah theres always a new builtin i learn exists and im like "that wouldve made this so much easier"
 Husoski: My back-burner challenge is to learn enough Ruby to be effective; and then Haskell to see I'm too old a dog to get that new trick.
 Husoski: Have fun.  Dinner time here...
 ipsissimus: o7

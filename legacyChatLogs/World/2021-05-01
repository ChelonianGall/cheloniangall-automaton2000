 Astrobytes: How is that ever going to work when it has Rick Astley in the URL
 MeNamesMarty: lol
 Alex-1: don't know Astro
 Astrobytes: I believe the correct response here is "d'oh!"
 Alex-1: theyare crazy
 Alex-1: Q_max why you paste that link any reson
 Alex-1: Astrobytes any idea i am solving Mean Max and it is hard
 KiwiTae: the multi?
 Chinnapat1231: Hello
 IvesL: does anyone play the bot games fantasic bits?
 IvesL: is there a way to contact support
 Astrobytes: what's up with it?
 IvesL: i just join the game which is wood league2.the game is a 2-player game.however, if my opponent doesnt have any input but he is on the left hand side, he is determined to come 1st
 Astrobytes: Post a replay please if you could
 IvesL: how
 Astrobytes: Under the viewer screen, Replay and Share

 IvesL: i will try to see it myself first, probably my problem, thanks for showing
 DomiKo: why even bother?
 geppoz: Notter , on the puzzle Resistance,  you can reach 50% with a simple recursive call , are you at this point already?
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: Oo
 geppoz: Notter, just done 100% , you can solve with a recursion, plus a lookup table for already explored sequences
 geppoz: (it is classified "very hard" and I did it in 1 hour??)
 IvesL: im new to this platform, do you guys have any favourite games?
 geppoz: IvesL , the favourite is always the next one :D it is coming spring contest
 jacek: hmmmmm
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:

 Marchete: size 8, is this euler?
 Marchete: Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: and the boss as well
 Coder_prabhat: how r u doing Automaton2000?:upside_down:

 Roxxx: Hello World!&#160;:)
 NiceCoder: how do I "league up" in crystal rush?
 BlaiseEbuth: You have to be ranked above the boss once all your matchs finished.
 NiceCoder: thanks!
 Roxxx: are there any groups for code escape?

 BlaiseEbuth: -&gt; #clash
 Smelty: hi
 Crimson0: hello!
 Esdeathmylove: gooodbye
 Roxxx: yo Smelty
 KiwiTae: Roxxx i just did the first one its fun
 Astrobytes: Also Roxxx, there's a channel on discord for it, if you're looking for team mates
 post4k: Hey guys, im new here. Is there a way to filter clash of code? I don't really care about "short code". 
 post4k: oh actually I guess not, since its ranked,
 Roxxx: @post4k yeah we must all learn python lolz
 Roxxx: @Astrobytes thanks i'll check it out
 Roxxx: @KiwiTae, the solo tutorial one or an actual multi?
 Smelty: o.o
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt; 
 KiwiTae: Roxxx the time travel one
 gamerboy15: where can i learn to code in clash of code except on view code from others?
 BlaiseEbuth: He said you have no friends Kiwi. I will not have appreciated. :o
 Roxxx: @BlaiseEbuth no i was just making sure, because the first one is the tut, and i completed that one as well
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah yeah...
 Roxxx: @BlaiseEbuth besides friends are overrated xD
 KiwiTae: i was gonna say ^
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh I totally agree, I have none.
 BlaiseEbuth: Was just trying to provoke some drama...
 Roxxx: Everything for laughs and giggles
 KiwiTae: I got like 5 new folowwers today :D &gt;&lt;
 BlaiseEbuth: They gonna eat you...
 jacek: new clash buddies?
 Roxxx: if you keep up that way, you'll gain new friends! ugh! Quickly, say something insulting :P
 Roxxx: jokes aside, what does it take to get silver in multis, i seem to break into bronze quite easily with whatever i pick up but haven't made silver in any yet
 KiwiTae: Roxxx a good if else
 jacek: p-3vel
 BlaiseEbuth: Money
 Astrobytes: Your soul.
 KiwiTae: Roxxx also depends the multi some get you hard stuck quick
 Roxxx: Astrobytes knew that there was a catch like that
 jacek: are you ginger?
 BlaiseEbuth: A soul for silver? I'm not so rogue...
 Roxxx: no i'll keep my soul ty xD
 Astrobytes: Jinjer?
 KiwiTae: wanna join me on fantastic bits?
 Roxxx: @KiwiTae, in what language?
 BlaiseEbuth: Brainfuck
 Astrobytes: French
 KiwiTae: i just swapped to cpp
 Astrobytes: From Java?
 KiwiTae: python
 Astrobytes: Ah
 BlaiseEbuth: Kiwi love clojure
 Roxxx: i'm only comfortable with java(for now)
 jacek: kree java!
 KiwiTae: BlaiseEbuth :vomit:
 Mikkel_T: How is the Clash of Code score calculated?
 Astrobytes: With a computer.
 KiwiTae: clash junky!
 Astrobytes: (sorry)
 KiwiTae: (not sorry)
 Astrobytes: :DYou mean the league ranking or the games themselves?
 BlaiseEbuth: That's a shame. If that was done by hand, a lot of people could have a job...
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: Oo
 Roxxx: @BlaiseEbuth says a person that automates tasks(via bots) for fun, Hypocrisy! xD
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm the devil dude...
 gamerboy15: :O
 Roxxx: aren't we all
 KiwiTae: no Roxxx only the ones reaching silver and above
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh no... :smiling_imp:
 Roxxx: daaaaayuuuum
 Roxxx: well i can't recover from that one now
 Roxxx: but soooon...&#160;;)
 p0int3r: hi
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: Hi?
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: I'm a new person here, don't know this website. By the way, I'm in Georgia cumming
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: Trying to solve power of Thor, and don't know the solution.
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: :confused:
 geppoz: hi
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: :neutral_face:
 geppoz: in the first episode you just need to output a direction
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: oh hello
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: ok? i dont know how
 geppoz: by printing "N" or "SE" or any other direction
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: :neutral_face:
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: ok!
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: I earlier went to the hints and copied the solution and does not work
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: :neutral_face:
 geppoz: when you start, you have a "dummy" solution
 Astrobytes: It's pseudo-code.
 geppoz: ofc that will not solve the problem
 Astrobytes: In the hints.
 geppoz: it is just an example on how to get input and give output
 geppoz: you must modify that dummy solution to make it work
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: ohhhhhhhhhhhh i get it
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: let me solve it
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: I cant i need help type the solution to me in the chat ok?
 Astrobytes: No.
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: :confounded::confused:
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: why
 Roxxx: @WaterCooledTopHat_3613, it's literally just 10 lines of code, copy-pasting the solution is not gonna help you learn
 Roxxx: try to think about it a little bit
 Astrobytes: Thinking is for boomers :P
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: im out of here
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: and bye
 Astrobytes: Gotta love that tryhard attitude
 Roxxx: lolz
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: oh my god just stop chating with me ok? pls!!!!!!!!
 Astrobytes: Obvious troll is obvious.
 Smelty:&#160;:((
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: Stop!!!!!!:rage::rage::rage:
 Astrobytes: Cruising for a kick are we?
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: eh i dont think so
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: :rage:
 Astrobytes: You haven't left. This is not your private chat. Kick next time, ban after.
 Iuliep: this chat is the same on discord too?
 Iuliep: can i type on discord and see mesages here?
 Iuliep: or is separate?
 Astrobytes: Separate. 
 Astrobytes: This is just an XMPP web chat
 Iuliep: oh ow thanks
 Iuliep: ok*
 Astrobytes: np
 WaterCooledTopHat_3613: dont talk to me
 Astrobytes: bye
 BlaiseEbuth: AstroBruce
 Roxxx: Can anyone reccomend a good course on algorithms(preferably through java, but if it's good can be something else)  and yes i know i can search for a lot of algos individually online but i prefer following structured courses over random reading, keeps me focused longer
 Roxxx: AstroNorris
 Roxxx:&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: Why Norris? He's AstroBruce
 Astrobytes: ChuckBruce
 Roxxx: like he just kicked a troll, round house kick and all that, chuck norris, no? xD
 Astrobytes: There's a book out there with Algorithms in Java
 Astrobytes: And I believe there are a couple of free courses
 BlaiseEbuth: No. You don't know Bruce? Bruce is a moderator. When a guy do shits on the chat, so Bruce ban him. And when a girl do shits on the chat... Bruce ban her. :sunglasses:
 Astrobytes: And paid
 Astrobytes: That was terrible BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: In a good way ofc.
 Roxxx: that's really vague
 Astrobytes: Yeah... I haven't done any lol
 Astrobytes: Whack a question on the discord, it's more permanent and more chance of someone seeing it
 Roxxx: you figured out all of this stuff on your own?
 jacek: some people had to pay for papers, but yeah
 BlaiseEbuth: Your question was really vague too Roxxx
 Illedan: Anyone good with RL around?
 Astrobytes: Well, I did a course in data structures and algorithms, foundations of computer science way back in 2006-ish
 jacek: not much experience with real life here
 Astrobytes: But it was pretty basic, and used a custom language built on er, js
 Illedan: Reinforcement Learning. I wonder if I should train only on wins? And only on P1 states or both :thinking: (for non-simultaneous games)
 jacek: train on both. and loses as well. bot should know when it loses and if thats bad
 Astrobytes: Roxxx: I thiiiink coursera do some good ones?
 Illedan: On both players? But then it need to recognize double the amount of states 
 jacek: you meant training data or something else?
 jacek: i have network for p1 perspective. during search the p2 just takes the negative of it
 Illedan: Ok
 Roxxx: Yeah coursera, pluralsight, udemy, udacity, i've checked them all out, but with courses it's a hit and miss, i was asking more like if someone completed a certain course and can recommend that it's good. :P
 Illedan: So you only use the trainingdata from P1 to learn
 Illedan: And look if P1 wins / losses. 
 Illedan: Tried to include P2 in the same network? It failed?
 Astrobytes: I heard good things about the coursera one which is why I suggested it, I only have experience with coursera
 jacek: never tried, no need to.
 Astrobytes: afaik the udemy,udacity ones are not worthwhile (so I've heard)
 Illedan: Ok, thx 
 Roxxx: @Astrobytes, ok i'll see what i can find there, thanks
 Roxxx: enrolled in a bootcamp of sorts at the moment anyway, but just looking for something to complete afterwards
 Astrobytes: cool, also post on discord Roxxx
 Astrobytes: At least people can see it if they're not in webchat currently
 Roxxx: posted&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Yep just saw it. People are usually decent with recommendations.
 Smelty: e
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I recommend Watermelon Margaritas
 Roxxx: Also @BlaiseEbuth a bit of a slow reply but i've just re-read your Bruce commend, missed it the first time i must say :grin: :laughing:
 Astrobytes: On the excellent side of atrocious it was :D
 BlaiseEbuth: AstroBorring
 Astrobytes: Borring?
 VizGhar: AstroQuestioning
 BlaiseEbuth: No humor. You're turning into reBless
 Astrobytes: "On the excellent side of atrocious" means it was an excellent crap joke. And crap jokes are the best
 BlaiseEbuth: Have not seen that. I still was on your "terrible"
 Astrobytes: Yes. The worse they are the better generally.
 Astrobytes: Did you hear the police finally caught up with that highly-selective lingerie thief?
 Astrobytes: Apparently he was a Basque separatist.
 <b>**Astrobytes already left</b></p><p><img src="/a/51696362414566" /> VizGhar: Roxxx you like video tutorials more or you'd rather read? And what kind of algorithms you wanna learn (I won't help you, just curious)
 BlaiseEbuth: Too much alcohol in my blood... I don't get it...
 VizGhar: Oh alcohol... my wife wanted to drink whisky. brb :D
 Astrobytes: I'm 3 beers in BlaiseEbuth and I get it :P
 BlaiseEbuth: I feel like there's a trap in your argument...
 jacek: 3 beers for scot is like breakfast
 Astrobytes: Says the Pole!
 Astrobytes: pirytus rektyfikowany
 Astrobytes: spirytus rektyfikowany
 Astrobytes: From birth
 Roxxx: @VizGhar i like both video and reading, but i have bought plenty of books already, so i want to balance it out(you learn better when you engage in different types of learning) as for what kind of algorithms, not a single specific one but i would like reading and listening about different algorithms and how people came up with them, to improve my own problem-solving skills
 BlaiseEbuth: Because the anglo-saxon beers are piss.
 Astrobytes: Stella Artois
 Astrobytes: The shop didn't have any decent craft stuff
 BlaiseEbuth: Piss
 jacek: american beer?
 BlaiseEbuth: piss of piss
 Astrobytes: The supermarket literally had really weak own-brand lager or extortionately priced craft stuff that was way overpriced for what it was. And the corner shop only had Stella.
 BlaiseEbuth: In such a situation I prefer not drink
 Astrobytes: I'm Scottish. I might die if I don't drink on a Saturday.
 BlaiseEbuth: So whisky
 Astrobytes: I haven't got any.
 BlaiseEbuth: Go pub
 Astrobytes: To sit outside for 2 hours in the rain?
 BlaiseEbuth: You're Scottish ^^
 Astrobytes: Even we have *some* standards.
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm drunk but I C#
 Astrobytes: As long as you can C# enough to see your python you're OK. Otherwise you might need some Java.
 BlaiseEbuth: :nauseated_face:
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Roxxx: rofl
 Astrobytes: Sorry.
 jacek: :unamused:
 Astrobytes: what are you making faces at jacek
 BlaiseEbuth: Yé. Drop your face
 Roxxx: jacek has some kind of alarm for whenever java is mentioned in the chat xD
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Astrobytes: better
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://iss-sim.spacex.com/">https://iss-sim.spacex.com/</a>was fun. Euler should make a 3D optim game of this :D
 Astrobytes: is that the docking sim?
 Illedan: ye
 Astrobytes: I failed so hard at that initially lol
 BlaiseEbuth: DOck what
 <b>**orangesnowfox grumbles that she still hasn't solved mars lander with physics and math yet</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: that's what GA's are for!
 BlaiseEbuth: GA!
 orangesnowfox: Yeah... I read the post on GAs for mars lander, but I haven't attempted one yet, I'm also doing a weird where I only have *discrete* movement (integer degree changes, +- power), I suppose that wouldn't make making a GA much harder though... Would still use floats for angles because "junk dna" helps somewhat probably
 orangesnowfox: The bigger thing I don't know is how long of a chromosome to store
 Manchi_o6o7: Guys, is there anyone who could help me out how to get files from a phone with a broken screen? Can't activate file transfer mode, after connecting via USB cable.
 jacek: no adb?
 Manchi_o6o7: the problem is that I can't set my Samsung A50 into debugging mode, somehow...
 BlaiseEbuth: Why do you broke the screen first...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: when u plug in usb cable does pc say, hey i found a device?
 Manchi_o6o7: yes
 Manchi_o6o7: it detects the phone, but without media access
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oic, so some security thing on your phone is preventing you from opening phone in your file explorer?
 Manchi_o6o7: I need to select on my phone "File transfer"
 Manchi_o6o7: But can't do it, because of broken screen 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i did this last week, but nothing blocked my pc from the files... had nothing to do with "media"
 Astrobytes: No, some phones require the filesystem access to be confirmed on the phone upon USB linkage
 Manchi_o6o7: yes, that's the case
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tap to decide what happens when this decice is connected....open file explorer.  i don't have that security, so I have no idea.  If it's on a sim card I guess you could pop it in another phone or adapter...but if it's on the phone itself you r prolly screwed
 Manchi_o6o7: there must be a way to pass the file transfer option
 BlaiseEbuth: NO. You killed it. You monster
 Manchi_o6o7:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: do a search for your phone model, there might be a tool for it
 BlaiseEbuth: Hammer seems to be a good choice
 cricri10000: Hammer Smashed Phone
 cricri10000: wooo, wrong account
 BlaiseEbuth: What's that thing
 Roxxx: don't know about internal memory, but remember that you can pull the SD card out and access it separately
 Astrobytes: In the pic?
 BlaiseEbuth: y
 Astrobytes: A badly stuffed seal iirc
 BlaiseEbuth: You really eat anything...
 Manchi_o6o7: everything is on internal
 vchapman: Is anyone aware of a reason the game would recognize my moves, but not actually execute them? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/544942333">https://www.codingame.com/replay/544942333</a> using golang.
 BlaiseEbuth: Missing spaces arround the |
 vchapman: Like this? MOVE 0 19 6 | MOVE 1 1 9 | MOVE 2 29 5 | MOVE 3 17 1 still standstill
 BlaiseEbuth: That's like this in the statement
 vchapman: I am confused. The bot does not have spaces between the pipes. 
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah... In fact you're outputing the current position of you pacs so they just stay in place.
 vchapman: :sweat_smile: thank you.
 cricri10000: From golang to stoplang :P

 Roxxx: question about java multithreading using explicit locks
 Roxxx: so in this example <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/5U2hp496">https://pastebin.com/5U2hp496</a>
 Roxxx: the newDeposit condition is atually useless right?
 Roxxx: actually*
 Roxxx: because if both methods use the same lock 
 Roxxx: then only one of those methods can be accessed at the time, and therefore if thread 1 is waiting for the deposit before withdrawing, then thread 2 can't even enter the deposit method to deposit and will therefore never notify thread 1 that deposit has been made
 Roxxx: am i wrong?
 ableflyer: guys how do i turn a hashtag that looks like a number into an actual number
 ableflyer: i use python3 by the way
 orangesnowfox: wym, sample data?
 ableflyer: e.g #
 ableflyer: sorry
 ableflyer: e.g #                                                                          
 Roxxx: let me try to summon jacek, JAVA JAVA JAVA
 jacek: welp
 Astrobytes: inb4 kree
 Roxxx: :grin:
 Roxxx: it worked
 jacek: so withdraw will wait forever because deposit wont be able to acquire a lock eh
 Astrobytes: next time try just using the keyword and not the actual ping - then we'll see
 jacek: hint: Princess Luna is best pony
 Roxxx: @jacek, that's from my analysis, i'm wondering if i'm correct on that assumption
 Roxxx: i took that example for a book i'm reading
 jacek: to be frank i dont know what Condition is
 jacek: for multithreading i use rxjava, simple synchonized and/or kotlin coroutines
 Astrobytes: Huh. And all this time we thought you were jacek.
 Astrobytes: But be Frank if you must.
 Roxxx: Conditions are objects created by invoking the newCondition() method on a Lock object
 Roxxx: used for thread communication
 Roxxx: @Astro you posted that pun from the wrong account, that's what the seal would say xD
 Roxxx: :grin:
 cricri10000: I was busy!
 Roxxx: @jacek, i started working on multithreading based on your recommendation :P
 jacek: :scream:
 Roxxx: quote from discord "really, in practive the big O isn't neccessary. app downloads stuff from internet and saves in database. so you want to know about i.e. rxjava and sqlite wrappers, some functional programming for java and multithreading"
 Roxxx: :D
 Astrobytes: So, learn rxjava, sqlite and kotlin?
 jacek: and in practice i use multithreading in high level, this is rather low level stuff, but good to know it
 Roxxx: one thing at a time Astro, i was most familiar with multithreading from all of the above so decided to start there
 Astrobytes: How functional is Java these days? I thought people preferred Kotlin for integrating that kinda thing
 jacek: talking from android development perspective, yeah kotlin does most functional programming stuff
 Roxxx: so jacek, you're using a monitor for multi then?
 jacek: yes
 Roxxx: oki thanks
 struct: Hello
 Roxxx: Hi struct
 Astrobytes: Hi struct
 cricri10000: "hii"
 gamerboy15: hi
 struct: need more cores
 struct: Time to upgrade
 Roxxx: how synchronous of you, we just were talking about multithreading xD
 cricri10000: download moar coars
 Roxxx: so if anyone was curious of the answer to my question, i found it on stackoverflow
 Roxxx: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36477197/is-a-reentrant-lock-released-when-calling-its-condition-await">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36477197/is-a-reentrant-lock-released-when-calling-its-condition-await</a>
 Roxxx: not same but similar
 Roxxx: turns out i was wrong
 Roxxx: once the .await() is called on a condition the lock is released again
 Illedan: jacek, how do you use your network together with a winning state? Just give a bunch of points to a winning state? Or use the network to classify a state as winning?
 jacek: win = 1, lose = -1 (i use tanh for output)
 Illedan: Ah, makes sense
 Illedan: I'll remove my linear for now and do that :D
 struct: Illedan you training a NN for which game, Oware?
 Illedan: Ye
 KalamariKing: Quick question is there such thing as cheating in CoC
 gamerboy15: just with finding code on google/yt ig
 Astrobytes: that's not cheating
 KalamariKing: If the whole challenge is to implement 5 given rules to determine if a year is a leap year, would it be cheating to use a library that determines if it is a leap year FOR you
 KalamariKing: If that makes sense
 gamerboy15: oh so thats allowed
 gamerboy15: oke ty
 Astrobytes: cheating is writing a bot that answers immediately with a pre-stored solution
 jacek: KalamariKing if language has such lib, you can use it
 Astrobytes: No it would not be cheating KalamariKing
 KalamariKing: :0
 KalamariKing: 1. Why is it now red and 2. interesting indeed

 Astrobytes: KalamariKing
 gamerboy15: does anyone know where I can learn clash of code coding other than looking at the code after completion
 KalamariKing: OH its a ping I am big brain
 Astrobytes: :D
 KalamariKing: gamerboy15 Personally I just played a LOT and eventually learned to get fast
 Astrobytes: gamerboy15: do puzzles. No time limit, no competition other than yourself. More learning opportunities.
 KalamariKing: That too
 gamerboy15: thank you guys 
 gamerboy15: but whats lot?
 gamerboy15: if someone can explain me pls 
 Astrobytes: he means he played many clashes
 gamerboy15: oh okay
 gamerboy15: thank yoy
 gamerboy15: :D
 gamerboy15: you*
 Astrobytes: np
 Roxxx: @gamerboy15, after you finish a clash try to search online for a yt video that explains a similar problem(it won't be related to CG, but still) that way you can memorize better ways of doing things
 Roxxx: that's my way anyway
 gamerboy15: oh thats a good idea, tahnk you so much guys &lt;3
 Roxxx: yw&#160;;)
 gamerboy15: a brate i ti si balkanac tek sad vidim
 Roxxx: da, but use only english in official chat
 gamerboy15: oh okay xD
 KiwiTae: is there a referee available for fantastic bits? :kissing:

 KiwiTae: :joy:
 Astrobytes: lol, classic :D
 KiwiTae: :flip:
 Astrobytes: endo!
 struct: Is there any tips on creating evaluation functions?
 struct: Im going mad
 Astrobytes: what are you evaluating?
 struct: Game state
 Astrobytes: No shit! What game :D
 struct: The game
 Astrobytes: Oh the game.
 Astrobytes: Algo?
 struct: beam
 Astrobytes: Not that it matters much tbh.It's kinda hard to recommend anything when the game knowledge is 0 tbh man
 Astrobytes: Take a break and come back to it.
 struct: I have stuff that works I think
 struct: beats all my previous bots
 struct: But I want a bot that destroys this one
 struct: there goes my goal of reaching rank 1 on stc&#160;:(
 fvla: Everything about this is just way too vague
 KalamariKing: Could be a secret project
 fvla: What does STC stand for?
 struct: smash the code
 fvla: ah
 Astrobytes: Ofc it's secret, why would you alert people to submit and bring you down?
 Astrobytes: So shhhh
 struct: Ill submit it soon anyways
 struct: I think it will go to the top at least briefly
 Marchete: smash the code?
 jacek: hint: you dont need eval if you train the NN
 jacek: [solved]
 struct: recurse stomped everyone 
 Marchete: NN it's like Neo from Matrix
 struct: Never seen the matrix
 jacek: struct only seen vector
 jacek: its the class that seen matrix
 Astrobytes: I don't know why I didn't follow you before Marchete but there, have a follow
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 Marchete: I imagine recurs_e's STC is a NN
 struct: Is there a NN for dummies?
 Marchete: you are 99th at STC
 Marchete: if there is, sign me in
 struct: marchete that bot is very old
 struct: Im hiding
 Marchete: from whom?
 Marchete: I mean
 struct: I heard you used simd on stc
 struct: is this true?
 Marchete: me?
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: bitboards
 Astrobytes: oof
 struct: Does it perform good?
 Marchete: I'd need to check if I use some SIMD functions
 Marchete: and that
 Marchete: performance is relative
 Marchete: but no
 Marchete: not that fast
 Marchete: considering is bitboards
 struct: I saw a puyo puyo implementation where they stored the entire board on 3 __m128
 struct: Crazy stuff
 struct: I didnt even bothered understanding it
 Spacefish: C# is not good for this site..
 struct: C# is good
 struct: Better than java
 Marchete: C# is perfectly fine
 Spacefish: I am good at it but you cant use its full potential here
 Marchete: like?
 struct: Same can be said about any language
 Spacefish: thats the problem no classes etc..
 Spacefish: no OO
 Spacefish: {
 Spacefish: P
 struct: There are classes
 struct: You can create classes
 Marchete: you MUST create classes
 struct: Even structs
 Spacefish: wait a minut
 Spacefish: e
 Marchete: structs
 Spacefish: you can
 struct: yes
 Spacefish: MY GAWD
 Spacefish: no wonder I am failing at this crap
 struct: Just needs to be inside class Player
 struct: I think
 struct: I dont know C#
 Spacefish: I do ... 
 Spacefish: you cant put classes in classes
 struct: you can
 struct: Also you can put them outside
 Spacefish: OMG YOU CAN USE CLASSES WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING
 struct: It should work
 KalamariKing: Anyone else doing suspiciously good with programming today? I've been popping off with sub-30-sec CoC's and I'm scared
 Spacefish: you can only put them outside of another class
 Roxxx: eureka moment lolz
 struct: no
 struct: you can put classes inside classes
 Spacefish: You cant in C#
 Spacefish: you can create new instances
 Spacefish: but not put the root class in
 Roxxx: don't know about C# but in java for example i'm making static inner classes
 Spacefish: yeah C# is very different
 Roxxx: you can instantiate those as much as you want
 struct: I tried puting a class inside a class
 struct: It works
 Astrobytes: is this something to do with the Player class thing perhaps
 Astrobytes: C# classes in classes worked for me previously
 Spacefish: never worked for me ON VISUAL STUDIO
 Spacefish: so idk how it works here
 Astrobytes: Must be doing it wrong
 Spacefish: WHY HOW WHAT&#160;? I just tried it
 Spacefish: here is weird
 Astrobytes: I mean it's part of the whole encapsulation thing right
 Spacefish: Have I been doing OOP wrong this whole time?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/MzlybID">https://tech.io/snippet/MzlybID</a>
 Spacefish: the hell
 Spacefish: wow
 jacek: is struct OOP after all?
 Spacefish: I been doin it wrong forever
 Spacefish: yes
 Spacefish:  it is
 Spacefish: coz you can make it into an object and get properties
 Marchete: struct is OOP in C++, yes
 jacek: is OP? netf plx
 jacek: nerf even
 Astrobytes: lol, I thought you were trying to type netflix
 Spacefish: netplx
 Spacefish: lol
 Spacefish: OOp is very OP its the most OP code ever
 Spacefish: yeah Ima stick to my own game dev and building my own engine its easier no joke
 jacek: with blackjack and hookers
 Spacefish: the hell
 Spacefish: :joy:
 Astrobytes: Futurama ref
 Spacefish: ok.. got it
 Spacefish: havent watched coz well old
 Spacefish: lol
 Astrobytes: And no, building your own 'game engine' is not easier than doing things on CG
 Spacefish: it is 
 Spacefish: I PROMISE
 Astrobytes: It isn't.
 Spacefish: coz there you define your own rules and requirements
 Spacefish: so you build what you need
 Spacefish: not things you would never think about
 Astrobytes: ...
 Marchete: "building my own engine its easier" :rofl:
 Roxxx: and invest 2 years to build a decent game engine by yourself sure :D
 Spacefish: yeah easier tbh, takes more code but is mentally easier
 Astrobytes: Good luck with that.
 Roxxx: let us know about your progress
 Spacefish: lol sure.. 
 Marchete: just pick a proven game engine
 Marchete: unity or unreal
 Spacefish: no hell no GODOT for life
 Spacefish: I am making one for learning experience
 Astrobytes: Right. Don't do that.
 Astrobytes: Not now.
 therealbeef: not a bad idea, colleague of mine did it and he learned a lot
 Spacefish: Exactly and I have made many stupid games I would never release
 therealbeef: took him 3 years, but what else to do with your life eh
 Spacefish: tbh I have nothing to do
 Spacefish: lol
 Roxxx: i recommend LibGDX, although technically it's not an engine, it's an excellent framework
 Astrobytes: You have a lot to learn before you can start to write your own Spacefish
 Astrobytes: And most of the time - you won't need to
 Spacefish: Yeah tell me what my skill level you think is... 
 Spacefish: english - 0
 Spacefish: but code..
 struct: just make sure to make your language start at index 1
 struct: on arrays
 Marchete: the skill level that thinking to create a game engine with 1 person from scratch is a good idea
 Astrobytes: Well, since you think game engines are easier than writing bots on codingame I would assume on the lower end of the scale.
 Roxxx: @Marchete lolz
 akram-fokin-ghanem: heyyy from tunisia XD
 KalamariKing: Just starting out with the bot racing stuff... could someone explain a few things?
 Astrobytes: Heyyy Tunisia
 Spacefish: yeah, I dont like the bot stuff 
 Spacefish: it isnt exactly fun
 Astrobytes: riiiight
 Astrobytes: Since you're into making games, perhaps you can make one for us using the CG SDK
 Spacefish: maybe
 Spacefish: the most bots I do is discord bots :joy:
 Spacefish: and yes in C#
 Astrobytes: ecks dee
 Roxxx: it's AstroBruce again
 Spacefish: who? what? am confuddled
 Astrobytes: Nah, no kickage needed here, this is civil
 Astrobytes: Be not confuddled nor discombobulated in any way dear Spacefish
 Roxxx: yeah i know, but just the overall impression
 Spacefish: who the hell is astrobruce?
 Roxxx: lol
 Roxxx: nvm
 Astrobytes: SDK's in Java btw, C# to Java isn't a huge stretch. Painful, but doable.
 Astrobytes: Or - I mean, feel free to make your own.
 Roxxx: CG is build using Java?
 Spacefish: You realise the engine I would make would be 2d and simple to       use
 Roxxx: *makes happy noises
 Spacefish: Lol puke I mean java
 Astrobytes: The SDK is in Java yeah Roxxx
 Astrobytes: JS modules and whatnot, pixi etc
 Roxxx: cool cool cool cool
 Astrobytes: Spacefish - CG SDK is technically 2D, but with a bit of fiddling you can leverage 3D
 Spacefish: ahh my smol brain cant handle 3d
 Astrobytes: e.g: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/blockout">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/blockout</a>
 Spacefish: interesting
 Astrobytes: You use Godot and don't use 3D?
 Spacefish: nah, I cant handle that
 Spacefish: my smol brain well is smol
 Spacefish: I just do 2D , coz I cant do art
 KalamariKing: Would anyone suggest some languages for the bot races? I'm considering c++ because python is too slow imo, but are there any 'better' languages in your combined opinions?
 Astrobytes: Why not just SFML or ... SDL ...
 OKOrchestraa: e
 OKOrchestraa: e
 OKOrchestraa: e
 OKOrchestraa: e
 OKOrchestraa: e
 Spacefish: oh god
 Astrobytes: Also, the PGE by javidx9 is nice
 Astrobytes: You'll have to do lots of stuff by yourself with the last few, but you can handle that. Being an engine dev and all that.
 Spacefish: lol you patronize me its funni
 Astrobytes: KalamariKing: Anything but python&#160;:)
 Spacefish: You do know , being like this just coz I'm new to the whole codingame scene is pointless
 Astrobytes: It's only because of your game engine development comment.
 Spacefish: yeah coz in my opinion its easier coz of the parameters being set by urself
 Astrobytes: You automatically gained the right to have the absolute rip taken out of you.
 Spacefish: Ok , well continue see how it helps me... See how your day improves... 
 Astrobytes: I would play with codingame a bit more, you seem competent enough
 Spacefish: Ahh patronization fun
 Astrobytes: Dude - no, I'm serious
 Spacefish: I dont know how much I believe you like idk if you are meaning that or not
 Astrobytes: The p*ss taking was well deserved. Don't be too butthurt.Trust me, dig into the site a bit.
 Astrobytes: If you can use Godot, you can definitely use codingame.
 Spacefish: Yeah I can use Godot ez but this site isnt anything like that
 therealbeef: each step is easier maybe, but the journey is much longer. finishing it becomes an issue
 Roxxx: has anyone completed everything on the site?
 Roxxx: ever
 Spacefish: ok.. see someone making sense and not being just idk what to say really TY therealbeef
 Astrobytes: of course the site isn't anything like using Godot, but if you can use Godot, surely the skills are applicable elsewhere?
 Spacefish: well idk, here is very different
 Astrobytes: "being just idk what to say really " - wtf man
 Spacefish: Lol
 Spacefish: that moment where english.exe stops responding
 Astrobytes: It's different, sure. But so are most programming environments you'll enter into
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 Astrobytes: regarding "being just idk what to say really " - no, I mean I know exactly what I am saying.
 Spacefish: Like I can do a discord bot or make a game , but I dont know how in hell to do math...
 Spacefish: like high level
 BlaiseEbuth: Nothing to do with hell, trust me.
 Spacefish: lol
 Astrobytes: LEARN
 Astrobytes: That's the point
 Astrobytes: You can learn as you go
 BlaiseEbuth: Watch your language Astro
 Spacefish: yeah but you dont learn anything when they ask you to do it without even explaining what they mean...
 therealbeef: hobby projects are fun, especially to start them, but it can start to feel like work at some point (i never finished my own hobby projects). CG offers lots of small problems to take for a spin and when you get sick of one you can start another&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: *they*&#160;?
 Astrobytes: example please Spacefish?
 Roxxx: the secret math society
 Roxxx: =they
 Spacefish: lol I have no example, but by they I mean the actual person asking the problem
 BlaiseEbuth: What problem?
 Spacefish: any problem where they arent descriptive at all
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah but on the site&#160;?
 Roxxx: this conversation is so vague i feel like it will evaporate at any moment

 Spacefish: my internet went off to switch to tomorrow's meter well today now
 Astrobytes: Then provide an example, otherwise you are proving nothing.
 Roxxx: :D
 Smelty:&#160;:)
 Spacefish: just leave it ... I'm really not in the mood to get insulted and told that I deserve it
 BlaiseEbuth: Insulted when?
 Astrobytes: Come on man, you claimed you could develop a game engine earlier and that this was an easier task than solving problems on this website.
 Roxxx: An excellent book on Math that i can recommend you is 3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development by Fletcher Dunn and Ian Parberry
 BlaiseEbuth: Just took the discussion, what's the what?
 AntiSquid: Spacefish, better use big words like non sequitur instead of insult when you randomly accuse people, it makes it more annoying and condescending 
 Spacefish: Astrobytes imagine you can play a guitar, just imagine, then you are told ohh you can play an instrument , SO PLAY THIS PIANO and then being told that if you dont you deserver the rip beaten out of you?
 Spacefish: and AntiSquid I never insulted anyone
 AntiSquid: nice 
 Spacefish: oh and astro used harsher language which I'm not gonna use&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Bad analogy since I play both
 AntiSquid: your bs meter is amazing
 AntiSquid: but you need to learn to be more eloqunt with your trolling
 Spacefish: ok.. Ima bout to leave this chat anything you wanna say to me?
 Astrobytes: Also *rip taken out of you - Scottish phrase
 AntiSquid: oh nice finish
 struct: o.o
 orangesnowfox: Spacefish, I'd expect someone who plays guitar to pick up piano faster than someone whose never touched an instrument (including their voice for singing) before
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: wasn't that just a weee bit harsh?
 BlaiseEbuth: What happened. Explanastrobytes&#160;!
 AntiSquid: he is level 4, easy reset to new account
 Astrobytes: See your chat and behold that he is banned BlaiseEbuth
 AntiSquid: if he wants to continue this
 liam...: unfair ban
 Astrobytes: IT RETURNS
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah I know I can read the logs, I'm asking you for an abstractbytes
 liam...: dude I am gonna stop.. 
 AntiSquid: nice liam...
 AntiSquid: i like you
 liam...: and that was real unfair lol
 AntiSquid: you didn't disappoint
 Roxxx: i called that AstroBruce will come out 30 minutes ago
 AntiSquid: now up your troll game or you get instaban each time
 Astrobytes: I didn't ban it was Squid
 Smelty: interesting
 liam...: I didnt troll but I am gonna leave this chat or prob get banned
 AntiSquid: lol
 Astrobytes: You're cool to stay ffs
 Astrobytes: Just have some humility 
 AntiSquid: again the "ima about to leave thing" :D
 VizGhar: guys? srsly? :D
 liam...: I got banned for saying that something is easier than another
 AntiSquid: threaten to delete account instead
 AntiSquid: sure haha
 VizGhar: I don't understand why to keep conversation like that
 therealbeef: Squid doing digital pushups to prepare for the contest mayhem?
 Astrobytes: Squid is banhammer-happy, I didn't ban you
 liam...: IK
 liam...: I could see that
 KalamariKing: banhammer-happy lol
 liam...: Yeah true tho..
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: we can't delete it
 AntiSquid: misleading Astrobytes
 BlaiseEbuth: Srsly Astrobvious, there's pages of bulshits...
 VizGhar: Astrobytes you can't delete but you can stop answering
 Astrobytes: Where BlaiseEbuth?
 liam...: ok why was I banned?
 liam...: just asking
 liam...: AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: liam... be more dramatic when making a fuss about it
 liam...: WHAT THE ABSOLUTE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU - better?
 AntiSquid: no&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: He had legit questions earlier VizGhar, you'd be amazed at the amount of crap-talkers that convert to well behaved users - at least 1 in 25
 liam...: aww
 AntiSquid: anyways it's the pointless drama of "i never insulted anyone, i had enough of being insulted" and other playing the victim nonsense, explaining it for the others that don't catch on quickly, you already know what you did
 Astrobytes: Did you know that liam is actually 'mail' backwards?
 liam...: yeah i do
 Astrobytes: cool
 orangesnowfox: namliam
 Enknable: have you considered changing your name to liame? just for the lulz
 AntiSquid: anyways welcome to the site, get an avatar and maybe make most of the site instead of just this weird chatting
 AntiSquid: what&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: Brain has been pattern matching all day (CotR), seeing patterns everywhere, send help
 Astrobytes: Mail thatliam
 AntiSquid: now that's bannhammer happy @_@ 
 Astrobytes: oh a wild Enknable appears!
 Astrobytes: hey dude, long time no see
 AntiSquid: like ... he has just been officially accepted to the site and you ban him 
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 AntiSquid: as if you were upset i banned him before you or something
 VizGhar: I'd like to participate in this converstation, but i don't&#160;:) gn
 AntiSquid: or maybe you hate that i made a friend&#160;?
 Astrobytes:  I wasn't upset at all, just playing :P
 Astrobytes: gn VizGhar
 Enknable: what up Astrobytes
 Enknable: just gettin in shape for the madness
 Astrobytes: Was gonna ask if you were participating
 spacefish2: thanks another ban
 orangesnowfox: Ahh, yes, the madness
 AntiSquid: spacefish2 welcome back
 Enknable: lol
 AntiSquid: get an avatar
 Roxxx: rofl
 Enknable: yup, hopefully we can get some Goooooold
 spacefish2: why the 2nd ban tho
 spacefish2: and by saying that I risk myself
 Astrobytes: Oh just settle down and code
 JustRadChippy: how do I get the height of something?
 Astrobytes: Measure it.
 AntiSquid: Spacefish2 idk, i think he is jelly we are friends now
 AntiSquid: play some multiplayer bot programming
 Astrobytes: did you just say... 'jelly'
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/2048">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/2048</a> spacefish2
 AntiSquid: try this it's probably the easiest one of all
 AntiSquid: spacefish2 how's your progress coming along&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Have you solved SpaceMaze yet tho
 Astrobytes: Let the record show that AntiSquid is a fine and upstanding member of the CG moderation team and I meant no slight with my joshing about his earlier ban.
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 spacefish2: havent started
 spacefish2: didnt check here
 struct: join the next contest
 struct: legend or delete
 spacefish2: wdym
 struct: im alread training my NN for it
 struct: Get legend on next contest or delete
 Astrobytes: *delete your account
 spacefish2: what no..
 Astrobytes: CG Roulette
 AntiSquid: 2 bans and you're scared of that challenge&#160;?
 spacefish2: I've literally only used ML.net
 AntiSquid: seriously&#160;?
 spacefish2: yes coz I'm running out of email adresses
 spacefish2: lol
 Roxxx: @struct how are you already training NN before the contest even started?
 Astrobytes: Very noob issue there spacefish2
 spacefish2: Me only using ML.net like yeah I make NN by going var context = new ML.Context
 struct: I could be training the NN
 struct: I just dont know how to make a NN
 struct: thats my problem :D
 spacefish2: google time
 AntiSquid: technically you can train NN on CG games and then do transfer learning for contest game Roxxx
 AntiSquid: but then he'd probably have to guess what kind of game it is
 AntiSquid: safest bet are grid games maybe&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: and if he can train a general AI like that, maybe he's better off competing elsewhere
 struct: Must be the game westicles mentioned
 Roxxx: whoa ok, that makes a bit more sense AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: technically I could train an NN on my left foot movements and then try to apply it to the next CG contest. Should be about as effective
 Roxxx: rofl
 struct: Maybe I can learn NN in 5 days
 AntiSquid: heh, funny, but what i said is legit
 struct: Im being serious too about the previous stuff :zipper_mouth:
 spacefish2: yeah Ima just say I'm inexperienced and I will learn how i want to learn.. 
 spacefish2: which might not exactly be this site...
 Astrobytes: I donno, I feel CG are moving away from grid games . . . 
 AntiSquid: wasn't reply to you . you could fork some github repo and adapt it, i see it's normal in the IT industry
 Astrobytes: Well, wheel-reinvention is seldom effective
 struct: antisquid are you testing the contest?
 struct: Cg said 4 people but only 1 came forward
 AntiSquid: why?
 AntiSquid: did i give too much away&#160;?
 struct: I knew it
 AntiSquid: it's autochess (grid game) with furballs, you collect 3 of a kind and merge them into something bigger
 Astrobytes: Shocking!
 struct: no yoda?
 struct: no csb remaster?
 Astrobytes: WHERE MA TOTOROS
 spacefish2: hey ahh someone I was in a clash with said the N word .. Coc3901
 AntiSquid: like what? yoda moving the pod around with his mind&#160;? struct
 Astrobytes: Yodoros
 struct: I guess, i never watched star wars
 AntiSquid: Naruto&#160;? spacefish2 tell them they have poor taste in anime
 Astrobytes: Have you watched anything struct?
 spacefish2: if naruto was a racist term than yes
 struct: ofc
 struct: I never watched the titanic
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/E3-CpzZJl8w?t=174">https://youtu.be/E3-CpzZJl8w?t=174</a> struct
 AntiSquid: here he lifts a CSB pod
 Astrobytes: Neither did I, I wasn't there at the time
 struct: I cant really focus on movies
 struct: Sometimes I watch them while coding
 struct: but thats about it
 Astrobytes: I like some things but I'm quite selective.
 spacefish2: Bans me: like no reasonhe has bad taste in anime when someone is racist...
 Astrobytes: I'm a little more musically-oriented
 spacefish2: so what C# is just a note to you instead of a launguage..
 spacefish2: language*
 spacefish2: me english bad
 struct: Yeap thats how it works
 AntiSquid: what's your mother tongue spacefish2&#160;?
 spacefish2: english lol
 spacefish2: afrikaans is flooding my brain tho
 Astrobytes: C# enharmonically is Db
 spacefish2: Blah blah I play guitar I dont need to know that..
 AntiSquid: how old are you anyway?
 spacefish2: my mom afrikaans dad english so I speak weird sometimes also am 13..
 Astrobytes: You play guitar?
 spacefish2: yes. badly
 Astrobytes: I think I see the reasons
 spacefish2: yes you do.. age
 Astrobytes: no, not that at all
 AntiSquid: discord bans people 12 years old and younger, not joking, but you can get banned if you joke about being 12 there :D
 spacefish2: Ik, I have lol
 spacefish2: but am 13 so .. safe 
 AntiSquid: not here
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: and then we have legit dudes like jrke on here
 spacefish2: no on discord..
 AntiSquid: here we constantly move the goal post spacefish2
 spacefish2: where is it
 Astrobytes: just for you
 spacefish2: its now 14 just coz I'm here ...
 spacefish2: lol
 AntiSquid: 15 and below gets the ban up to midnight tonight
 spacefish2: cya
 spacefish2: then 
 AntiSquid: ya i am sleepy, good night
 AntiSquid: cya some other time
 spacefish2: oh wait it past midnight fr u
 Astrobytes: I'm out too
 spacefish2: noice
 spacefish2: cya mods
 struct: seed=-5372814513092559900

 Astrobytes: No it's not past midnight
 spacefish2: for me it is
 struct: gn
 spacefish2: for me it icy cold
 spacefish2: like COLD
 Astrobytes: lol it's the same seed from the other night struct?
 struct: yes
 struct: I use this seed to test
 spacefish2: ahh the joys of being new to a comunity
 spacefish2: and not being able to spell
 Astrobytes: spel yer oan sintinces carectly spacefish2
 spacefish2: yews I woll
 Astrobytes: Nice
 Astrobytes: Good response
 Astrobytes: Anyway, gnight
 spacefish2: nise i nkow
 spacefish2: Gn 
 struct: gn
 spacefish2: me doin clash of code to prove my worth turns out that is none
 spacefish2: well I give up
 Zenoscave: Has anyone tried logic to avx transpilation? Struct?
 DiKetarogg: Has anyone had this issue when your program does output the right answer, yet console says failure: found nothing?
 DiKetarogg: Standart output shows the output to be correct by the way.
 struct: what is that zeno?
 Zenoscave: DiKetarogg you forgot a newline
 DiKetarogg: No, I did not.
 DiKetarogg: Do I need two newlines or something similar?
 Zenoscave: struct taking logic flow of a program and transpiling to avx equivalent
 struct: you mean like auto vetorization?
 Zenoscave: yeah.
 Zenoscave: at source time though
 DiKetarogg: I added 7 newlines. Still nothing.
 struct: have no idea if anyone ever tried it
 DiKetarogg: I tried adding extra spaces at the end. It works, but the spaces are counted towards the answer.
 Zenoscave: DiKetarogg what problem
 DiKetarogg: It says it found nothing.
 struct: All I did with AVX was poor mans implemention to CSB
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 DiKetarogg: But Standart Outout Stream says otherwise.
 Zenoscave: DiKetarogg what puzzle i mean
 DiKetarogg: 2x2 Cube
 Zenoscave: did you find better timing with flags?
 DiKetarogg: 2x2x2
 Zenoscave: Ok what language?
 DiKetarogg: c++
 Zenoscave: how are you printing
 DiKetarogg: std::cout
 KalamariKing: Did you forget an endl, or some other way to flush the stream?
 Zenoscave: ending with std::endl?
 DiKetarogg: yes
 Zenoscave: which test case is failing
 DiKetarogg: First
 KalamariKing: What happens if you replace the variable you are printing with an arbitrary string
 KalamariKing: Does the string print? If yes check your variable, otherwise check your print statement
 Zenoscave: do you print "FD\nFD\n" or some equivalent
 DiKetarogg: I print "FD"
 Zenoscave: you need to print two lines. It asks for a 2x2 facce
 DiKetarogg: Thanks. The expected thing got me confused.
 Zenoscave: if you click the menu option above the test cases it shows the exact output for each test case expected. Careful though. hidden cases are used to make sure you don't hardcode
 DiKetarogg: Thank you.
 struct: Zenoscave what are you working on atm?
 Pato05: sx

 KalamariKing: Ya know something tells me otherwise
 DiKetarogg: So about the Rubix cube again.. It passed all the testcases, but after I submitted, it failed the last one. How exactly does the validator deffer, or what do I change so that it does not think I hard coded?
 struct: did you hardcode?
 DiKetarogg: nevermind, I found a bug.
 DiKetarogg: I did npt.
 DiKetarogg: not*
 DiKetarogg: It's just a little annoyign when you don't know what is wrong and what exactly it does not like.
 Notter: Does anyone have tips for The Resistance? I finished my code but I can't figure out a way to optimize it enough to pass the 4th test case.
 struct: I havent solved it, but have you tried checking the forum?
 struct: I heard some people say they solved it after they read it
 Notter: Oh yeah sorry
 Notter: I forgot that the forum exists ._.

 DiKetarogg: Try multithreading. That's a good trick.
 struct: You only have 1 thread on CG
 DiKetarogg: Shame&#160;:/
 Notter: What's the time limit anway?
 DiKetarogg: Less than a second for sure. Cuz sleep(1) fails.
 DiKetarogg: At least if the time limit is the same on different puzzles.
 XeroOl: @notter I've got a tip
 XeroOl: instead of looping over the words, build a look up tree
 XeroOl: that way the large amount of words doesn't cost as much'
 XeroOl: as well as using memoization on the string
 XeroOl: like the problem description suggests
 DiKetarogg: sounds like a job for std::map
 XeroOl: not even like that
 XeroOl: std::map might work
 XeroOl: but then you'd need to know the length of the words to check
 Notter: Ok, I'll try
 DiKetarogg: Depends on what the task is.
 XeroOl: basically, all the strings are `-` and `.`
 XeroOl: so I made a binary tree
 XeroOl: where the left child represents adding a `-` and the right child represents a `.`
 XeroOl: so you could check words of increasing length just by traversing down the tree
 XeroOl: and you would know there are no more words when you hit he bottom of the tree
 XeroOl: I think the tree might have stored the words backwards, for memoization, but it's the same idea
 Notter: I'm still trying to understand what you just said
 abt8601: That data structure is called trie, if you want to look it up
 Notter: Yes, but I'm thinking about how I can apply a trie to solve this problem

 Smelty: first use caesar shift 13 decoder then flip each word around
 Smelty:&#160;:)
 hex.master8:&#160;;-;
 hex.master8: hellO ,there how are you ?doing thiS text is using a cypher where you first reverse each individual ,word then shift it by a given .amount caN you solve ?it

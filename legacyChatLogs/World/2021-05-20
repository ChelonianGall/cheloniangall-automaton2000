 Wontonimo: what up Smelty?  did you finish all the tacos in the cooler yet?
 OBenjOne: In silver league, I found the shield wasn't actually super useful, It helps, but it's really helpful in gold and legend once you get two bots. I actually passed silver without having a shield code
 OBenjOne: Of course I might have been using it wrong
 Wontonimo: i think that's  legit

 derjack: yes
 JanPolivka: Do I need a 100% result to get the solutions?
 Uljahn: yes
 JanPolivka: So what do you do, when you get stuck? Doesn't that limit learning?
 VizGhar: it definitely doesnt encourage it&#160;:)
 Uljahn: i read discussion threads on the forum
 VizGhar: ^^ best place to find some ideas
 Uljahn: they are spoiler-free most of the time, so you won't get full answer
 JanPolivka: this is very frustrating
 Uljahn: that's how creativity and coding skills are developed i guess
 Uljahn: googling for the answer teaches you nothing
 derjack: /me
 JanPolivka: Well, not really. The way you "get creative" is by simply increasing your knowledge in your long-term memory.
 JanPolivka: So if you have no similar pattern in your long-term memory, you can't apply it until you see it at least once. You might get lucky too
 derjack: sounds like overfitted NN
 Uljahn: i agree, you'd better know most basic algorithms, there are puzzle tags and external links for that
 JanPolivka: yea, sounds like extra steps for no reason
 darkhorse64: If you are new here, my best advice is to start with the easy official CG puzzles. The next step is to learn about floodfill algorithm because it is ubiquitous
 JanPolivka: I do feel like easy ones are too easy because they only test syntax. 
 darkhorse64: Go next level then

 LelouchVC2: The squid returns
 JanPolivka: Shadows of the Knight. I eventually figured it out but the struggle seems unnecessary
 LelouchVC2: Look for puzzles that actually seem interesting, or it'll feel like a waste
 JanPolivka: Because I need to use this site for an take-home exam, I don't have the luxury of doing only the things I find interesting.
 JanPolivka: That's what I am complaining so much, probably. I'd rather do the exam on a different site
 LelouchVC2: university exam?
 JanPolivka: job interview
 LelouchVC2: oh cool
 derjack: i wonder if i ever used those fancy algorithms at work :thinking:
 KiwiTae: fancy algo?
 derjack: binary search, BFS/DFS, other graph things
 VizGhar: Android -&gt; findViewById :P ~BFS
 Nerchio: those are more like basic instead of fancy but sure :D
 derjack: but are they explicitly used at work? yet they are asked in job interview
 Nerchio: i mean depends where you wanna work

 Uljahn: is it against the rules?
 VizGhar: You can copy-paste solutions&#160;:) You still have to adjust them
 VizGhar: I was googlin non-stop
 Uljahn: ^
 Uljahn: same
 derjack: oh my
 Uljahn: although when you know the solution it's faster to code it by hand than to find it in google and c&amp;p
 VizGhar: competition in CoC isn't that scary&#160;:) you can easily beat 90%+ coders there by googling stuff (It's hard around 150th place and further)
 VizGhar: and it's probably hard for me just because I'm forced to use Ruby there (I don't know ruby, but its sufficient for CoC)
 Wontonimo: i've never googled an answer in CoC.  Can you just paste in the name of the clash or something simple like that?

 slas: i just translate
 elderlybeginner: DogukanSENER depends what you are expecting. I'm in middle gold with 80 lines of code. Nothing fancy, just 1 evaluation function
 Wontonimo: hey slas, let's say you want to raise 1.0002 to the power of 1200,000 
 DogukanSENER: chkec private
 Wontonimo: you could do it your way but it would be 1.2 million iterations.
 Wontonimo: what if instead you calculated it for 1.0002 ^ 1000 , stored that , then raised that to the power of 1200?  Same result and only 1000+1200 iterations
 Wontonimo: that isn't the solution, but hopefully it nudges you in the right path

 elderlybeginner: any simple rules to get gold in UTTT without serious stuff?
 JeefKek: Does anyone know how to solve the Coders Strike Back challenge?
 derjack: is search serious?
 AntiSquid: UTTT is pretty much an anti-heuristic multi
 derjack: JeefKek solve?
 JeefKek: yeah
 elderlybeginner: currently I start in the middle, close xxx or defend o-o, never put x in midle of the rest of the grids. That's makes me top silver
 elderlybeginner: I was going to try MCTS when in gold
 derjack: JeefKek you can't 'solve' it, its multiplayer game. unless you mean to fix the X Y cordinations in tutorial
 Whatar: which rank are you JeefKek?
 JeefKek: yes
 derjack: elderlybeginner try teccles iheuristic send opponent to the same board if possible
 elderlybeginner: derjack, oh, that's already implemented
 derjack: oof
 AntiSquid: google some guides for ultimate tic tac toe, there's a tutorial how to always win as X for a different version out there
 derjack: that version is very different
 elderlybeginner: yes, this one closes the table when xxx, the rest leave the gird open even when it's already lost/won
 JeefKek: do you know how to fix the x and y issue?
 AntiSquid: "very" is excessive 
 Whatar: If I remember correcty they are both X in the example given, and you just need to swap the second X for a Y
 elderlybeginner: no simple strategy that I could be able to find beyond what's already written. There was some gambit letting middle to be lost and pushing opponent back to the middle, but's that different version
 derjack: have you tried avoiding moves that would lead to finished board?
 elderlybeginner: hmm, no, and that's simple to implement, don't think that it would be enough to jump from 25.5 to bosses 27.5Thanks for the idea

 Magmaflood: How about treat the sub array as an object?
 jacek: huh
 Magmaflood: [30][10] is object a, so [20][a]
 Magmaflood: and so on and on
 reCurse: That's what happens at compilation no?
 ZarthaxX: jacek seems too specific
 BunnyDude548: can someone tell me how to use boost in coders strike back? 
 jacek: naah
 Magmaflood: yea, but if he wants to specifically make a function that works 2d, then he need to do it one by one

 mikmak: what is the teccles heuristic?
 jacek: if you can, make move that sends opponent to the same board
 mikmak: ok thks, so I can probably see it on your replays.
 ClockSort: e.g. if you are on board 3, try to make the opponent play on board 3 also?
 jacek: yes
 ClockSort: :thumbs_up:
 Earnest_Gibbs: I'm stuck in the bronze, i'm not sure if I should be dodging pods now or something else?
 VizGhar: Uff that Last Crusade 3 is harder then it looks&#160;:|
 Wontonimo: Earnest_Gibbs, are you playing Coders Strikes Back?
 Earnest_Gibbs: yea
 Wontonimo: i looked at one of your replays
 Wontonimo: and it  looks like you are targeting the checkpoint
 Wontonimo: instead of that, you can correct a bit  for your drift by instead of targeting the checkpoint, subtract your current speed times 3
 Wontonimo: so instead of (x,y)
 Wontonimo: use
 Wontonimo: (x - 3*vx , y - 3*vy)
 Wontonimo: let me know how if that works for you  Earnest_Gibbs
 Earnest_Gibbs: What is vx and vy?
 Wontonimo: velocity in the x direction and y direction
 jacek: velocity, in other words, speed
 Wontonimo: gogo, derivitive of position, zoominess
 Wontonimo: (aka, change in position from one turn to another)
 Heathro: activities -&gt; complete has "1" notification. where is that? what is it? or it shows all the time?
 Wontonimo: where do you see that?

 Heathro: i found
 Wontonimo: excellent, because i have no idea
 Heathro: i should tap on CODINGAME FALL CHALLENGE 2021. because it is "new"

 Wontonimo: yes, you should (I guess)
 Wontonimo: yeah,  to sign up
 elderlybeginner: how do you evaluate position in UTTT?
 struct: NN
 jacek: most people use MCTS, no 'evaluation' in there
 elderlybeginner: yep, how about minimax?
 struct: its hard to evaluate the game
 jacek: im not aware of minimax in legend
 struct: there is
 struct: dbdr was minimax iirc
 Smelty: hmm so you can get to silver in game of drones by jus telling the drones to go to closest place?
 Wontonimo: hey  elderlybeginner, I tried evaluating position in UTTT
 BlaiseEbuth: print(["WAIT","DOUBLE HULK","-3vel"].random())
 Wontonimo: and one way is to just  count the number of miniboards you own - opponent.  Very quick and simple,  obviouly flawed
 Wontonimo: but it is better than nothing
 Wontonimo: for miniboards that are not owned, count your pieces - their pieces per mini-board but weigh the boards differently.  Weigh the corners with 50% more value and the center with 100% more value
 xXWolfbloodXx: ...
 Wontonimo: this won't get you in legend.  for that use NN or MCTS
 elderlybeginner: yep, simple but limitedyep, I also thought about rating open grids according to position e.g center 4, corners 3, other 2
 elderlybeginner: both minimax and MCTS are new to me, so it's learing experience
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U</a>
 Wontonimo: a fantastic video explaining MCTS in simple straightforward steps with testable values
 jacek: you can rate almost winning/losing miniboard higher/lower. like if X could win that board on his move, then that board is good for X
 Wontonimo: hey, elderlybeginner, if you write a simulation don't do minimax or MCTS first.  First, write flat MC   (I used  to call it 1plyMCTS but it is called flat MC in the literature)
 Wontonimo: simply stated, for each possible first move of yours, run as many simulations of a full random game and keep track of the number of wins.
 Wontonimo: do that equally for each first move and then when you run out of time, play the move with the most wins.
 Wontonimo: If you can simulate 10k moves, this will get you to high silver
 Wontonimo: then you know your sim is good and fast  and then add a search, like minimax or mcts
 elderlybeginner: thanks for the link. I believe you recommend it :wink:

 <b>**xXWolfbloodXx slaps Wontonimo around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/63304428623584" /> raxkin: Wontonimo you mean 10k simulations each turn? I'm also starting with mcts. But i guess i will need to use bitboarding to have fast simulations?
 raxkin: Or i should be able to reach 10k without bitboard?
 Wontonimo: I don't think you'll get into Gold without bitboarding.  I'd be super surprised if you got 5k/100ms w/o bitboard.
 ClockSort: does CSB really not tell you, for example, your own velocity or the location of the opponent's pod?
 Wontonimo: what level ClockSort&#160;?
 raxkin: Ok, i'm training with Breakthrough, and doing 500-600 sims, 2k at last turns, without bitboarding, also scala, so was not sure if it was normal
 DomiKo: ClockSort it does
 ClockSort: it strikes me as odd, no pun intended, that they enable collisions but don't tell you anything about when/if a collision happens or will happen.
 ClockSort: @Wontonimo bronze

 jacek: dbd is using mcts for breakthrough no? and he prints the iterations count
 ClockSort: @jacek i only watched the first three minutes.
 AllYourTrees: ill check jacek
 jacek: and if he doesnt troll, it it 5k iterations in first turns
 jacek: ClockSort good action starts at 30 minutes
 AllYourTrees: ya he does jacek. so hes just using plain mcts? isn't 5k kinda low?
 jacek: probably heavy biased. but maybe dbdr will answer himself
 DomiKo: i have plan mcts with full random rollout and I got like 64K 
 DomiKo: but i'm 71st soo...

 elderlybeginner: there is match and rematch in UTTT. Wining both is calculated as one win or two wins??
 raxkin: like x10 more iterations for example?
 jacek: most likely an order of magnitude
 AllYourTrees: probably more than that tbh. it saves on memory which means copies are faster, and it means you can compute multiple things at the same time with the bit ops
 raxkin: Ok, good to know, i guess that will be my next topic to learn
 Wontonimo: yeah, to give some context raxkin, I made a python version of UTTT without bitboard and it was able to make about 300 simulations on the 2nd turn.  With C++ using bitboards  that increased to 40,000 on 2nd move
 raxkin: i see, thanks for the info
 LelouchVC2: Python is so fast that the cops couldn't keep up
 Rddevelop: hi
 Rddevelop: uo
 Rddevelop: yo
 Rddevelop: hey what puzzle do you recommend me?
 Rddevelop: i dont know  every puzzle is fun
 Rddevelop: okey thanks
 ClockSort: here's a good puzzle: how to get others to use the chat at approximately the same UTC time that you are doing so.
 jacek: :thinking:
 Rddevelop: UTC I LOVE utc
 Rddevelop: hey bro are u still thinking
 Rddevelop: it was nice to chat with you guys, see ya the next year
 ClockSort: see you fall 2021 actually
 ClockSort: coming soon on Date Not Defined Yet
 King_Coda: Hey, I'm in the top 10,000 again!
 King_Coda: 9,061st
 ClockSort: nice!

 ClockSort: you may note that there were no volunteers for your link.
 King_Coda: Oopsie!
 AntiSquid: that's a kick next time .
 LelouchVC2: Why isn't it a kick this time?
 AntiSquid: you really want him kicked?
 LelouchVC2: Nah, its a family guy reference
 LelouchVC2: Peter makes fun of the prison he's in and his black friend gets hit. Warden tells him, "Next time, that'll be you."
 LelouchVC2: And the black guy was like, "Well why wasn't it him this time!?"
 LelouchVC2: You're welcome
 BunnyDude548: can you please show me an example  
 LelouchVC2: of what?
 ClockSort: sure.

 Wontonimo: sus
 Denshire: i think they meant an example of being kicked
 BunnyDude548: ya
 Denshire: okay i can show you an example but I'll need a volunteer
 MeninuhFinn: guys, which way should I go first? Algorithms, clash of code or AI?
 AntiSquid: LelouchVC2 don't answer that. It's another case of meaningless and ambiguous question @_@
 MeninuhFinn: im kinda confused
 Vinicius_Rangel: Hey guys, there's a discord for golang specific?
 AntiSquid: always wasting your time
 AntiSquid: ClockSort what the hell man.&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: don't be like king code please
 BunnyDude548: do AI first. it is the best. I am doing it right now
 MeninuhFinn: is AI easier than the rest?
 BunnyDude548: do you know how to code a bit?
 MeninuhFinn: yeah, i started data structures these days
 MeninuhFinn: but only for C++
 BunnyDude548: then yes, AI or clash of code
 ill-be-waiting-outside:  hi
 MeninuhFinn: i'm starting with javascript
 MeninuhFinn: thanks for the help &lt;3
 BunnyDude548: you can always change the language 
 MeninuhFinn: oh nicee
 MeninuhFinn: i changed to javascript
 BunnyDude548: Can anyone tell me how to use boost in coders strike back? 
 LeviathanProgramming: it's called Read The Instructions
 LeviathanProgramming: @BunnyDude548
 BunnyDude548: i did but boss 3 keeps beating me&#160;:(
 Mr.X_13: what?
 Mr.X_13: wtf
 ClockSort: I tried to just use the boost on the first turn. output "BOOST" instead of "100" for the thrust.
 Galis16: Sorry guys, can anyone help me? I hve a problem when submitting a puzzle. I have solved 'IPv6 Shortener' in JS by using 3 different regex. All tests passes but when submitting I fail in one case and got a message saying something like I failed because of a hardcoded code... Of course, I don't hve any hardcoded chunk. Its just a line with 3 replaces, so I dont get it

 LeviathanProgramming: no
 BunnyDude548: you are being mean @LeviathanProgramming
 LeviathanProgramming: you are being nice @BunnyDude548
 Wontonimo: no, BunnyDude is being mean about you being factual
 LeviathanProgramming: lol
 LeviathanProgramming: KaneyklovAleckAlkhilJohn, and bitwolf are always together for some reason most of the time.

 Smelty: LeviathanProgramming , JohnCM Both of them are actual bots, just click on their profile and you'll see it
 dodochunk: i was super confused does this site teach you the languages&#160;???
 Smelty: this is a site where you can apply your coding skills to compete
 Smelty: however, you can also learn in the "learn" section under activities
 dodochunk: i see that thank u
 dodochunk: what does syntax mean?
 Smelty: the way you code in a language
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/28ed2117-eb21-4f78-886d-76b743719bf6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/28ed2117-eb21-4f78-886d-76b743719bf6</a>
 AntiSquid: dodochunk
 JohnCM: clash of code is really good to learn a new language
 JohnCM: you just keep clashing until you win
 AliMourtada: I learned python like that
 Smelty: yep
 Smelty: ANd search up everything that you dont know as you are clashing
 AntiSquid: clash of code is horrible if you need to look up syntax rules, best to do easy puzzles 
 New_coder_please_help: has anybody here done Code vs Zombies? I'm struggling to understand how people are memoizing this problem, it doesn't strike me as a DP problem

 BlackDereker: Spring Challenge 2021 seems s overwhelming
 BlackDereker: there are a LOT of inputs
 New_coder_please_help: it's best to start with just the inputs you get in the lower lleagues and then work your way up
 New_coder_please_help: it's much less overwhelming that way
 BlackDereker: there is a starter code to group the inputs better
 New_coder_please_help: that is also true
 New_coder_please_help: but my point remains
 JohnCM: the spring challenge is not that bad. majority of the inputs are neighbour inputs, which is meant to help you do the seeding possibility decision
 JohnCM: if you ignore all that, you can still get into bronze
 BlackDereker: so the wood strategy is just complete the highest tree sizes?
 JohnCM: wood is just complete, the faster the better
 JohnCM: yes
 BlackDereker: can someone train a neural network in this game?
 BlackDereker: and if yes, how do you persist your model weights?
 AntiSquid: you train locally, setup game locally and only put the final weights and forward prop in the submit version .
 AntiSquid: what i did anyway .
 BlackDereker: did u do that on the Legend league or before?
 codeing: #in
 Wontonimo: BlackDereker, if you implement NN for your bot in a multi here, you'll be one of the very few.  Some of those few have been wildly successful using NNs here
 Wontonimo: for Spring Challenge 2021, using the data as they provide it is really  really handy for starter code.
 Wontonimo: something that is really nice about the data is they provide a neighbour lookup, and it is exactly aligned with the sun
 Smelty: yes

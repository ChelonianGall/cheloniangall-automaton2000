 ____Z_X_C____: right thx
 Ghouljokes: I really regret going "Hmm I'll just put my pod in the silver arena just to see how it does against other people so far" because now I'm stuck in gold with ai that wouldn't have had a good track record against sebulboss
 5DN1L: is "track record" intended to be a pun?
 Ghouljokes: no, it was just a happy accident
 5DN1L:&#160;:) and yeah, once you go forward you can't go back again
 eulerscheZahl: gold is like a different game. 2 pods, all checkpoints known, different input format, ...try "Search Race" for a single player version of the game

 FORMS1: not working*
 5DN1L: Did you try to use cerr to debug?
 FORMS1: I did not
 5DN1L: Try it. See if any actual values of the variables differ from what you expect them to be
 FORMS1: how does one cerr?
 eulerscheZahl: int temp[i];
 eulerscheZahl: out of bounds?
 eulerscheZahl: and you don't even have to store all in an array.on top you declare a new array for each iteration of the loop just to store 1 value - behind the array
 eulerscheZahl: in total it looks to chaotic for me to dig further
 5DN1L: Best to let him cerr and see for himself :shrug:
 eulerscheZahl: right

 Thorcode: he can chat anywhere esle but not this chat
 Thorcode: I just talked with him on dis cord
 eulerscheZahl: bans always work per channel
 ____Z_X_C____: hmm how come the top three in codingame is all not mods?
 eulerscheZahl: so you can't really ban him from CoC chats as a new chatroom is created every time
 Thorcode: eluer is a mod
 eulerscheZahl: i used to be a mod but resigned
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr still is
 Thorcode: ah
 Thorcode:  sound right
 ____Z_X_C____: o
 ____Z_X_C____: hmm is there a way to block a person from private chats?

 Thorcode: I tried to find a way
 ____Z_X_C____: thats sad
 ____Z_X_C____: what if someone just spam your account?
 Thorcode: there's a lot of  pp I want to blick but I can't
 eulerscheZahl: not even mods can block anyone from sending them private messages
 eulerscheZahl: and you sometimes gets insults after banning from here
 ____Z_X_C____: what if someone just spam your account?

 BlaiseEbuth: There's some holes yes.
 SpiritOfACowboy: mode is reverse
 SpiritOfACowboy: i have righted 1
 SpiritOfACowboy: i mean
 bmacho: why is the chat log publicly available 
 SpiritOfACowboy:  Console.WriteLine("1");
 bmacho: is that even legal
 SpiritOfACowboy: if i write this
 SpiritOfACowboy:  Console.WriteLine("2");
 bmacho: there is a suggested scope of the audience and availability of my messages 
 SpiritOfACowboy: i defferent line
 bmacho: that only you will see it, for 15 mins
 bmacho: wtf
 SpiritOfACowboy: it give error
 BlaiseEbuth: Only public chans are logged bmacho.
 bmacho: that if i write somehting here, only you 5 people will see it for 15 mins, not that everyone can search, my employee, my wife, 3 years later 
 bmacho: thank you for listening my vent against the world 
 bmacho: have a nice day
 BlaiseEbuth: That's a public chat, you're not supposed to say here things that could be compromising anyway...
 bmacho: That would called forum or message wall. 
 bmacho: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06983340-be00-460f-9040-979615f17c09">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06983340-be00-460f-9040-979615f17c09</a>
 bmacho: Have I allowed "CG Community" to handle my messages and put my messages on their f.in webpage? No? Then why is CG available in the EU? What are my leaders doing, making random laws that they don't intend to enforce? Why? 
 BlaiseEbuth: Grmpf -_-
 BlaiseEbuth: Not even sure there's a law about that.
 BlaiseEbuth: Every chat, on any site is fully logged, even the private ones...
 bmacho: Yes, CodinGame logs the chats, that I accepted when I registrered 
 bmacho: Also, I am fully aware that CG can't guarantee to not to log the chats, (they definitely should try) but it seems that they even encourage it, and are not very clear about that random people do actually put my name, face, and my chat messages on their websites 
 Astrobytes: "I am their user, they should protec me, ban the scrapers and the people that expose me, close XMPP, take down community wiki with lawyers, etc etc. Not supporting them" - I don't know if you noticed but the community is pretty far from malicious...
 bmacho: Well, they already exposed me and my messages, so it's not just a potential concern. 
 Astrobytes: did you say something terrible in the web chat?
 5DN1L: How did they expose you? We don't know who you are
 DialFrost: lol
 bmacho: Then they haven't exposed me to you personally :shrug:
 5DN1L: oh. wow.
 Astrobytes: the wiki chat log doesn't store anything other than your username and what you said in the webchat...
 Astrobytes: Whatever you do... Don't. Join. Discord.
 Kururugi: and when you said what in the webchat
 Astrobytes: Kururugi: that's implied as it's a chat log
 bmacho: Discord is very clear about that every message is available, they even let me read back :mind-blown: 
 Astrobytes: you can read back your messages on the chat log here too . . .
 bmacho: I can't
 Astrobytes: Er... yes you can
 Kururugi: i am only seeing till last 2 hrs

 Astrobytes: It's a wiki link...

 bmacho: It's still a crime, and you shouldn't link it.
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: OK, well enjoy making storms in teacups and mountains out of molehills&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: "random people do actually put my name, face, and my chat messages on their websites" So you're really a pink pony with glasses named bmacho? :o
 Astrobytes: and "If you want to develop your own chatbot one day, here are some tips.First, store all available information, even if you don’t currently plan on using it." - you do realise you can't scrape sensitive personal info right...
 Astrobytes: Unless you really don't want people knowing you like ponies
 BlaiseEbuth: Is 'your' pic free of rights btw? :smirk:
 bmacho: Nope.
 bmacho: It's stolen.
 Astrobytes: A crime! :o
 bmacho: Stolen from Hasbro, and an internet artist I don't know
 bmacho: :shrug:
 Astrobytes: Corporate and personal IP theft eh, that'll carry a heft punishment...
 Astrobytes: *hefty
 Kururugi: Maybe yt creators
 bmacho: So I shared accidentally shared something compromising of me, in the fate that only you read it, and it will disappear 
 bmacho: But nope, it will be forever on archive.org, and anyone can find it, searching my name 
 Astrobytes: you are aware this is a *public* chat
 bmacho: I was in the fate that this is a *chat*
 bmacho: And that CG holds the things that promised me in our contract, and EU wants them to do
 bmacho: Making the basic security and such
 Astrobytes: Complain to Thibaud&#160;:)

 bmacho: That's my answer to " Complain to Thibaud&#160;:) " 
 bmacho: It's.. done
 Astrobytes: He might not read that for weeks

 darkhorse64: Astrobytes: this is the same guy that has been complaining on and on that DFS2 is NP hard and that the 5000+ solutions already found are all wrong. This is his new trolling subject
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 bmacho: I tested some solutions
 bmacho: And guess what
 bmacho: They was all wrong
 Astrobytes: NP-Hard :D
 bmacho: :shrug:
 bmacho: 2 player games tend to be NP-hard (you can simulate your favourite NP-hard problem with a good configuration)
 Astrobytes: I think by now I'd have written an auto-kick script for myself :P

 FinnKrause: hello
 Big_Code: hey folks, for mars lander - episode 2, is it possible to use land_x and land_y to read the terrain? going well up to 3rd case but without reading the ground it feels like i have to change x and y to match each test 
 struct: check if the land_y is equal two times in a row
 Big_Code: I threw land_y into the debug output and it repeats the same number for the whole test 
 struct: it doesnt for me
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9a505f22-0765-4e04-aca0-203fc82b820f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9a505f22-0765-4e04-aca0-203fc82b820f</a>
 struct: thats what I get on the landX, landY for loop
 struct: on test case 3
 Big_Code: Ohh Okay, I see where I was wrong to get that output. you printed out the landX, landY results from the first for loop i assume? I tried to print out landX, landY but the program gets upset since it expects a speed of 0-4
 Scarfield: you cant print out the x AND y coordinates untill you have read them all, ie not in the first loop. they have to be stored. you can error print, the game will ignore error prints, which language are you using?
 struct: Big_Code you can print do stderr to debug
 struct: which language are you using?
 Big_Code: ah i see, thanks for clarifying. I'm using python 3, sorry bit of a noob especially with error outputs
 jacek: you never make errors? :o
 struct: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Hexman: lmfao
 Big_Code: @jacek oh no i make errors all the time hahah i just meant with actually seeing the errors  :sweat_smile:
 Big_Code: struct I have that line at the bottom, thats where I was getting just a single output for my landX and landY
 struct: ah
 Big_Code: It just outputs 6999 800 the entire loop
 struct: python things
 struct:&#160;:)
 Big_Code: heh, ill keep hammering away. was able to get about 20 outputs of 6999 800 :sweat_smile: just curious, what language did you use for your landX, landY outputs?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9b470532-93b2-4834-a59a-a6299e9055d5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9b470532-93b2-4834-a59a-a6299e9055d5</a>
 struct: that should print it on first turn
 Scarfield: ah remembered it being seperate loops for x and y coords
 Big_Code: .. :expressionless: i guess i didn't scroll all the way up last time I tested, I see the output from the first turn now. Apologies and thank you!!
 seagull: Is the guy at #1 in the UK actually a bot?
 struct: in clash of code?
 seagull: yea
 seagull: Couldn't find a UK chat
 struct: i have no idea if he is using a bot or no
 seagull: oh you're a moderator i feel bad now lol
 seagull: i was just wondering cause it would be a pretty funny taunt if they arent but i don't think theyre actually from uk
 Leeeooo: Hello guys&#160;:)
 Outsmarted: hi guys
 Big_Code: :wave:
 Leeeooo: How are you&#160;?

 thunderegg: anyone have perfect coding for Power of thor ep 1
 thunderegg: plz send
 Scarfield: BalckEbuth, Balkcek
 BlaiseEbuth: It's not explained by gaurav sen? Disapointing...&#160;:/
 struct: bigger board is needed for sure
 jacek: and make it hexes
 Scarfield: thats a given
 jacek: msmits will solve it in a night
 Big_Code: I think im lacking the math skills for this lol. I need to find the straight line from the input of landX and landY. Do I have to compare each coordinate? or would anyone have a nudge in the right direction? :grin: don't want any answers, just kinda stuck
 struct: you need to check if the previous landY is equal to the current landY that you are reading
 struct: the points are given in the right order
 Leeeooo: What is this shit bro $
 Leeeooo: fsdfsdf
 TheVietJedi: please respect each other in the chat
 Big_Code: Ohh I see, so i'm thinking a bit more advanced? All I have to do is determine if the current landY matches the previous, and if so, thats the line? 
 struct: I think so
 Scarfield: it is
 Big_Code: that looks like the case according to the other test coordinates. much simpler then I was thinking. thanks a ton!
 Outsmarted: fuck you all
 Leeeooo: OH&#160;!
 Leeeooo: What are you doing bro&#160;?

 thunderegg: who
 bmacho: Can you kick and ban the bullies thx 
 thunderegg: CG
 thunderegg: is that the guy
 thunderegg: Send me code for Power of Thor ep 1
 thunderegg: my code didnt work
 Big_Code: why not figure it out yourself
 Big_Code: copy pasting the right code won't help you
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: thunderegg, it isn't solvable.  NP hard
 thunderegg: Im not a good coder
 thunderegg: just started weeks ago
 thunderegg: and its my first time
 thunderegg: Wontonimo told me how to start
 thunderegg: But i didnt know
 Husoski: Then go work on your chops in easier puzzles until you *can* write the code.
 Big_Code: with the best intentions; you won't become a good coder if you just use someone elses code to solve the puzzle&#160;:) if you do, at least try to understand what the successful code is doing 
 thunderegg: No i dont wanna do kiddi coding
 thunderegg: i started on python
 struct: well you also dont want to skip steps
 thunderegg: ik
 Alex4200: hello
 thunderegg: Whats the easiest game to start with
 Husoski: I just looked...Power of Thor 1 is pretty easy after all; *IF* you know coordinate geometry.  
 Husoski: There are several ways to figure this out.  One is to measure the distance to the light measured in number of moves) and see which one(s) are shorter..
 Husoski: Or, get out a pencil and paper and work out how to choose the right direction based on (x2-x1) and (y2-y1) values.
 Husoski: PS: Thor moves like a king in chess, and the "king distance" between (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) = max(abs(x1-x2), abs(y1-y2)) moves.
 Husoski: I strongly suggest you get out that pencil and paper (or a checkerboard) and see *why* that formula works.
 thunderegg: So whats the easiest game
 thunderegg: that has a helping thing
 Husoski: Games aren't easy, almost by definition.
 thunderegg: So
 thunderegg: Whats best for begginers
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Go fish
 Big_Code: you just said you didnt want to do kiddie scripting so why do you want an easy game
 thunderegg: A game on this site thats a bit easy
 thunderegg: Not very easy
 Husoski: They usually have many parts.  Thor is pretty easy in 2D.  Mars Lander episode 1 is 1D, but it helps to know some physics.
 struct: thor is probably one of the easier ones
 thunderegg: ok
 bmacho: temperatures is it
 thunderegg: What site did yall use to start coding
 Husoski: I used Mars Lander 1 to get the "multiple languages" achievement.  
 thunderegg: Whats the best begginer site
 thunderegg: :angry
 Husoski: CodeWars has a bunch of easy puzzles and they don't offer you harder ones until you succeed at your current level.  That's not too bad if you can handle the easy ones.  
 Big_Code: :joy:
 thunderegg: :angry:
 thunderegg: :rage:
 5DN1L: So we're all responsible for your learning, heh?
 thunderegg: No
 thunderegg: Im just asking how yall learned
 thunderegg: So ican use that methode
 Big_Code: Seems like you want everyone else to be responsible, "Give me code for thor ep 1, i dont want to do kiddie scripts, give me easiest game, oh thats to hard, give me easiest website"
 thunderegg: Shut up
 Big_Code: :joy:
 Husoski: There used to be a decent free site called "Learn Python the Hard Way" (still there but changed format and not free) and some of the advice in their intro was golden.  One in particular was: "Don't copy-paste."  Period.  If you get a piece of code you want to use, type it it.
 VizGhar: well we are loosing yet another user&#160;:(
 Husoski: If that seems like too much work, you need the practice typing code.  Meanwhile, just the act of doing that (and fixing up typos later when the compiler complains) helps you focus on just what that code is doing.
 Husoski: Turns out, "the hard way" is really the easier way in the long run.
 Uljahn: agreed
 thunderegg: LOOSER
 5DN1L: ViZGhar, I do think CG should make it clear to the new users that they are expected to have acquired the basics of a programming language before using this website. This is more of a website for practising (and learning more advanced stuff)
 5DN1L: thunderegg Please be respectful
 Husoski: That means "more loose", not "one who loses".
 Big_Code: someone is a little upset that thor beat him&#160;:(
 thunderegg: ok computer man i wont be disrespectful
 thunderegg: thunderegg Please be respectful
 Big_Code: no one codes perfectly the first time, if you can't handle getting it wrong 10 or even 100 times, maybe its not for you
 thunderegg: I can handle it
 thunderegg: its just ive been working on it for weeks
 thunderegg: So can someone teach me or send me a link to were they learned
 thunderegg: Looserig
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: That kind of persistence is perfect for joining the marine corp. 
 thunderegg: LOL
 thunderegg: IM NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR ANYOF THAT
 thunderegg: Does anyone think im gay
 bmacho: persistence I do have :eyes:
 BlaiseEbuth: Persistence is np hard.

 5DN1L: like which puzzle?
 5DN1L: I can give you an example
 bmacho: In the left menu the "solution" button should become clickable 
 bmacho: in the IDE

 5DN1L: :scream:
 bmacho: so how do they know about that you opened the problem IDE?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So if there's ever a CG convention there will be a run run on zit cream and rubber cuckies
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er duckies
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: bmacho, that's the kind of thing I'm talking about.  nobody knows how they do it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 8sigh*
 bmacho: what
 bmacho: wtf
 Big_Code: hey folks, would anyone have a sec to help me understand why 'land' is numbered like this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/D6HKFsST">https://pastebin.com/D6HKFsST</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hackmag.com/security/rubber-ducky/">https://hackmag.com/security/rubber-ducky/</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nevermind
 BlaiseEbuth: Automaton2000 don't talk to this guy. He said you're a criminal.
 Automaton2000: i feel like the boss is going down
 bmacho: what's the input?
 5DN1L: Big_Code because you used enumerate
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did a puzzle, i will return to the real world now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 5DN1L: that's not land_x really
 5DN1L: i think it is (land_x, land_y)
 5DN1L: but you have named the tuple "land_x"
 bmacho: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee581a07-2c41-4350-8058-35c10aa901a3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee581a07-2c41-4350-8058-35c10aa901a3</a>
 Big_Code: You're right, I was thinking I would change land_x, land_y to a single variable, and it would hold them both as a single coordinate. but by changing it to just a single 'land_x' that probably messed it up 
 bmacho: try land_x.append (  input().split()[0]  )  
 5DN1L: change that into land_x, land y
 5DN1L: Big_Code
 bmacho: no don't try this, that will lose all the land_y values
 5DN1L: and delete the list
 5DN1L: well
 5DN1L: depends on what Big_Code wants
 5DN1L: many ways to achieve the same goal
 5DN1L: surely i won't say mine is the only way
 Big_Code: hmm, well my goal was to get each set of coordinates from the input bundled together, then compare Y values to find the landing pad. Someone mentioned the landing pad coords will always be paired together, so i've been trying to list them out to compare the values
 bmacho: isn't Python's story that its creator wanted to do everything only 1 way? 
 Big_Code: and once it gets to the set of coordinates that is the line, store those as a variable to use later. So I can tell the lander where to go
 5DN1L: create an empty list in the beginning
 5DN1L: then in the loop, read the inputs and append to the list
 5DN1L: after all have been read, you can do whatever you want with the list of coordinates
 Big_Code: I think my concern with having them separated was the X value losing track of which Y value it's tied to
 5DN1L: you can use tuples
 5DN1L: or a list as you have used
 Big_Code: Okay gotcha I'll give that a shot, thank you all very much for your time :grin:
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 5DN1L: typo: 12 minutes ago - i typed "tuple" it should be "list"
 5DN1L: 10* minutes ago
 Big_Code: well this is quite a different output :joy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/21LeFVqy">https://pastebin.com/21LeFVqy</a>
 5DN1L: lol
 5DN1L: coords = [int(j) for j in input().split()]
 5DN1L: this is quite sufficient to hold one pair of coordinates
 5DN1L: then surface.append(coords)
 5DN1L: and print(coords, file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Big_Code: hmm definitely some progress I think. By replacing coords with surface in the print statement, i was able to get a list of coordinates outside the for loop
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 Big_Code: now I just have to find out how to compare the Y values while keeping the X values tied to them :thinking:
 5DN1L: If you don't modify the list, the values will always be there
 visva: any1 here good with methods in java
 Nixerrr: Everyone
 Nixerrr: What's happening?
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't insult me.
 Big_Code: one thing I'm wondering is, are the x and y values separate in this list I made? or is each group of coordinates considered a single value 
 Nixerrr: :kissing_cat:
 Big_Code: I think I just need to lookup how input.split works 
 5DN1L: Big_Code, yes, look it up first, and ask if you still don't understand
 Big_Code: Will do, thanks again for all your help! :grin:
 5DN1L: :clap:
 BlaiseEbuth: You killed a fly&#160;! Monster&#160;! :scream:
 5DN1L: doesn't matter if I didn't kill you during the process :smirk:

 xargon: Can anyone simplify for me what a hash map is?
 5DN1L: dictionary
 5DN1L: Have I oversimplified, Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: i need to learn c++
 xargon: 5DN1L yes, but to much :D 
 5DN1L: lol
 xargon: what is the difference between a map and an object?
 bmacho: objects are more general than maps 
 bmacho: maps are objects too
 bmacho: but there are other type of objects 
 VizGhar: like knife or book
 xargon: is there anything a map can do that a generic object can't do?
 VizGhar: map is data structure that hold key-value pairs (keys are unique)
 5DN1L: VizGhar: reminds me of "The pen is mightier than the sword"
 VizGhar: object is instance of class and can do whatever it is designed to do

 Rebollo: Basically I am struggling to sort MAP elements by their key string length 
 Rebollo: in C++
 Rebollo: And I am inserting the elements inside a for loop just like that:mapMorse[morseCode] = word;
 Rebollo: without using insert keyword..
 Rebollo: got
 Rebollo: it
 Rebollo: I ignore the fact that the length could be equal
 Rebollo: I was using only "&lt;"
 Rebollo: in the lambda function
 Rebollo: should use &lt;= instead
 AmineACH51: Hello
 Rebollo: Hi mr. everybody is sleeping..
 AmineACH51: Yeah 
 Rebollo: Or they are to smart to talk to people like me
 Rebollo: too*
 Rebollo: or too nerd
 superpenguin612: lol
 Rebollo: just kidding
 zakacat: How many total clashes are there?
 PATTRIM: a lot
 zakacat: So, like what are the chances of me just doing a lot of them and hoping that I get to do repeats to beef up my numbers?
 Rebollo: null
 zakacat: Lol, fair 
 Rebollo: kidding
 Rebollo: The goal here is learning
 Rebollo: everything else is nothing
 bmacho: close to 0
 zakacat: Um, I am pretty sure the goal is to be the very best, that no one ever was. 
 Rebollo: for some of genius you are right
 Rebollo: there are a lot of them
 bmacho: there are a lot of things too 
 bmacho: so one might think that they just choose a thing and he can be the very best
 bmacho: but actually the geniuses are the very best in multiple things, and if you came up with a random thing
 bmacho: you can't be the best 
 bmacho: bc some geniuses will be still better than you
 Rebollo: they are
 bmacho: yeah 
 zakacat: hmm, ingenuity can also be a measure of how well a person can solve problems. I think this includes trying to solve unfamiliar problems.
 zakacat: Like, practice is one thing, but we want those critical thinking skills 
 Rebollo: OMG I need the help of a genius
 Rebollo: they are awesome
 Rebollo: And I am not
 Rebollo: OMG some can help me with inserting elements in a c++ map
 Rebollo: sorting by a custom rule?
 Rebollo: like for its length
 zakacat: I am not that genius 
 zakacat: lol
 Rebollo: They sleep during the day I think
 Katespizer: use js, its better than c++, trust me 
 Rebollo: say it carefully here you might break a few hearts
 Alex4200: hello what are you going&#160;?
 Rebollo: bad
 Thorcode: fine XD
 Thorcode: trust me just summon biggie small to be happy XD
 Rebollo: Does anybody knows what I am doing wrong to sort a MAPA by its key string length?
 Rebollo: auto comp = [](const string&amp; a ,const string&amp; b) { return a.length() &lt;=  b.length(); };
 Rebollo: C++
 Rebollo: please
 Thorcode: I dunno XD
 Rebollo: The size of the ap is showing 10000
 Rebollo: but when I do a loop
 Rebollo: with
 Rebollo: map.begin()
 Rebollo: map.end()
 Rebollo: show only 1000
 Alex4200: oriented object.

 eulerscheZahl: clash of code gives CP, not XP
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Wontonimo: correct, my bad, it's CP
 jamieSloop: hello
 Wontonimo: hello
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: whats cp?
 sbooyah: I bet you could guess
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: clash points?
 sbooyah: You got the gist
 jacek: this is also bash command
 immijimmi: yikes CP is not the best name for it
 jacek: oO
 MrSok: hey guys, is there any way to persist calculated data&#160;?
 Stilgart: persist between two tests/games&#160;?
 MrSok: yes, if you want ingame calculated data to persist
 eulerscheZahl: each game is a new process. you can't transfer anything
 MrSok: yes i thought so but i see some impossible solutions in code golf
 Stilgart: cheating is the way&#160;:(
 Stilgart: (i don't do it that much, and I am top30, though)
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: should I tell mouton5000 to put back his puzzle&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: sure, go ahead
 eulerscheZahl: do you consider something like this cheating?
 MrSok: so you cant weite anything to text files huh&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: correct. no memory between runs
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: wep
 MrSok: *write
 Stilgart: i consider not handling North in thor cheating
 eulerscheZahl: ah. but Thor goes North now
 eulerscheZahl: they updated validators
 Stilgart: not exactly
 Stilgart: they tried&#160;:)
 MrSok: but you could  read from web things 
 eulerscheZahl: there's something about diagonal movement iirc.
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't remember what exactly. at least I found a way to abuse their lack of testing
 Stilgart: but it is quite specific
 Stilgart: me too, but this is cheating to me
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, i prefer generic solutions too&#160;:(
 Stilgart: it wouldn't be hard to write a referee à la batman
 Stilgart: for thor at least
 eulerscheZahl: for don't panic my code would break if you give it more than 9 floors
 Stilgart: mine too, but only a matter of one char
 MrSok: so how big you managed for panic
 eulerscheZahl: 175 in python. i'm a bad golfer
 eulerscheZahl: and i don't use that unicode trick
 MrSok: well in python it is possible, but in pascal 110 is impossible
 eulerscheZahl: how many chars do you need for a system call in python?
 eulerscheZahl: 110 in pascal. same user has 79 in bash
 eulerscheZahl: so 31 chars for the system call?
 MrSok: well, those guys ruin all the fun in this project
 eulerscheZahl: not my fault. i'm just delivering the news
 MrSok: i know&#160;:)
 MrSok: well i will stop trying anything in golf, it's more than a best cheat finding contest then a programming one
 MrSok: every code should be checked for validity and fair programming
 MSmits: fair programming is a slippery slope
 eulerscheZahl: try the bot programming section
 eulerscheZahl: there you can see what your opponent is doing. not the code but that actions generated by it
 jrke: MS i joined connect4 writing my first logical bot
 ChampionCoder: Just a question:Since there are "Legend" almost everything (legend levels, legend ranks, legend bot programming levels, legend achievements), are there Legend skills too?
 ChampionCoder: Skills as in the things needed to solve a puzzle
 MrSok: skills as being champion coder for instance;
 MrSok:&#160;?
 MrSok: rofl
 ChampionCoder: well, no, but the boxes you tick after having completed a puzzle
 ChampionCoder: Wish I could upload a pic
 MrSok: explain 
 zhoubou: You mean on home page, those quests?
 ChampionCoder: No! Not the quests
 zhoubou: Oh I know what you mean
 Westicles: You aren't a true legend until they talk about you every day on #fr
 ChampionCoder: Above "achievements" on the home page?
 zhoubou: Those skills such as "Conditions", "Arrays", etc.
 ChampionCoder: Yes!
 MrSok: aaah&#160;! yes good point
 zhoubou: I have no idea if there are legend ones
 ChampionCoder: Ok thanks
 ChampionCoder:&#160;:)
 zhoubou: Someone else might know more&#160;:)
 zhoubou: But from what I'm seeing, it doesn't follow the pattern
 ChampionCoder: Ah
 zhoubou: It's fundamentals, intermediate and advanced instead of bronze silver gold
 ChampionCoder: Yeah I saw it followed the typical system until Gold
 ChampionCoder: Similar colours :sweat_smile:
 zhoubou: Haha yeah
 zhoubou: I checked very hard puzzles, and can't see any red ones
 ChampionCoder: Ohh ok thanks
 ChampionCoder: Just general info, that's why I asked
 zhoubou: Yeah, I got curious as well
 MSmits: jrke welcome on connect 4 then&#160;:)

 jacek: bloody hell!
 <b>**Astrobytes strangles jacek</b></p><p><img src="/a/35448723594340" /> jacek: there is tags edit text box when you create contribution

 Toby75: No I mean change from clash to puzzle or something like that
 jacek: unlikely
 Toby75:&#160;:(
 jacek: just abandon this one and create new
 Toby75: nevermind
 Toby75: I just published a new contribution, would someone mind checking it out? I took a lot of effort, it would be amazing!

 eulerscheZahl: what is "a lot of effort" measured in hours?
 jacek: i wonder how i can vectorize 3d array
 jacek: as in use those fancy simd or avx

 jacek: to somehow vectorize this nested loop sum
 struct: I know how to get from index on 1d array but have no clue on 3d
 jacek: im thinking of converting it to 1d

 MSmits: darkhorse64 you here?
 saylor: happy new year
 jacek: [slowpoke]
 MSmits: maybe he lives beyond australia
 darkhorse64: hi
 MSmits: actually beyond the US i should sau
 MSmits: hey
 MSmits: have you noticed connect4 seems lopsided in favor of p1?
 MSmits: i am thinking of suggesting pie rule
 MSmits: when i play my bot against itself it wins most matches as p1
 darkhorse64: Too early to tell but it seems like 4 as p1 is not good
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d911b5fd-404e-4e32-beb4-1fd1e0c2d90b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d911b5fd-404e-4e32-beb4-1fd1e0c2d90b</a>
 MSmits: started running meta mcts to test
 jacek: 1039, serious confidence
 MSmits: games :P
 jacek: come back after million
 MSmits: true, but a steal wont hurt 
 darkhorse64: MSmits is a prolific book writer
 MSmits: I'll let it run overnight
 jacek: so you have 3 cores busy now?
 MSmits: nah i stopped yavalath for the moment
 jacek: i know! to make it more fun, connect4 should disallow connect3
 MSmits: lol, that would make it wayyyy easier to solve
 MSmits: the advantage of steal is, that out of 5 starting moves, if one is solved as a draw, the entire game is solved as a draw
 MSmits: and it will not be otherwise, judging from that solve-table you shared
 MSmits: (extrapolating from other sizes)
 darkhorse64: tric trac is on the lb too. Competition is heating. I need to improve my C4 bot. I intended to steal the solver for detecting winning moves but it looks no good. Detecting open ended 3 in a row is not enough
 darkhorse64: *solver code*
 jacek: so all the cool kids are gonna do c4?
 MSmits: I kinda already ran out of ideas for my bot :P
 MSmits: mcts doesn't have that much to experiment with
 MSmits: (that has a major effect)
 MSmits: rollout already reasonably heavy
 MSmits: I did improve performance a bit last night. It now does 2.4M in first second
 darkhorse64: Did you have success with avx compared to plain code&#160;?
 MSmits: i never tried plain code here.
 MSmits: but i did improve my avx
 MSmits: i use avx differently than you are, so it would be a bad comparison anyway
 MSmits: i use it to find the winning moves
 MSmits: (not to check for wins)
 MSmits: my entire bot does not have a win check
 MSmits: I check if the opponent has a winning move. If he does and I cant block it, i lose. If all moves lose, i play a random move
 MSmits: before search i do check if i have a winning move, but thats the one time, if i have, i play that ofc
 MSmits: jacek, you may have been right about the statistics
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db6905be-d4eb-474b-b9c3-53c957ca1025">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db6905be-d4eb-474b-b9c3-53c957ca1025</a>
 jacek: such condifence
 darkhorse64: So you know a move ahead the outcome, hence win check is useless
 MSmits: went below 70%. I hope they will all go to 50, but doubt it
 MSmits: darkhorse64 yeah exactly
 jacek: still its all 2/3
 MSmits: that's what the center moves were for yavalath until i solved them
 eulerscheZahl: reCurs e has mirrored matches in chess. so does langton
 MSmits: yeah mirrored might help but not if it is just gonna be win for p1, then win for p1 again, but for the other player
 eulerscheZahl: if you consider connect4 as a multiplayer, that seems mandatory to me
 MSmits: then you have uttt
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 jacek: but uttt has pairs in leaderboard
 MSmits: uttt would be *a lot* better as a game if it had steal
 eulerscheZahl: there's a reason why struct never tried to get c4 released (even with a bigger board)
 struct: yeah, the code would be easy to change
 struct: I think its a good game, just not suitaable to be competitive
 MSmits: i'm not sure
 struct: maybe for practice would be good though
 MSmits: if there is 1 move solved as draw, a steal might fix the balance
 eulerscheZahl: with a medium AI that you have to beat in some cases and tie in others
 eulerscheZahl: as a puzzle
 MSmits: also why would a bigger board not fix the problem?
 eulerscheZahl: interactive like that cutting link puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: skynet?
 MSmits: 7x6 is way too simple, 7x9 might be also, not sure
 MSmits: but bigger than that and it's very far from solvable
 MSmits: then it just needs balance
 MSmits: and steal can fix that if there exists one balanced move
 MSmits: (starting move)
 MSmits: or am I missing some vital characteristic that makes it unsuitable for competition?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i'm just too biased. those static starting positions that call for a book just turn me off somehow
 MSmits: ahh of course, that's always going to be a problem
 eulerscheZahl: i know it's still a lot of work to generate the book
 MSmits: also for some games it doesnt help all that much
 MSmits: if uttt had steal, books would be useless
 MSmits: (so would many heuristics)
 MSmits: D&amp;B is pretty much unbookable and has fixed starts. So is Go. 
 MSmits: this is mostly because of the many possible starts and huge branching
 jacek: amazons *.*
 MSmits: seems like a nim game
 MSmits: kinda fun
 MSmits: but yeah hard to book
 MSmits: both open and end 
 Stilgart: D&amp;B&#160;?
 MSmits: amazons
 MSmits: dots and boxes = D&amp;B
 strattan: Good day
 struct: I have it saved somewhere
 struct: Last time i checked it was working
 MSmits: your old connect 4?
 jrke: damn miklla took the heat
 strattan: So I have new desires to learn AI and Im going to learn C++ alongside it.
 struct: no, Amazons
 Astrobytes: yeah you showed a working version
 MSmits: oh

It doesn't work for me and I wonder if that's my problem or contribution broke
 MSmits: looks like i have a reason to go back to D&amp;B. Will be a week or two  though
 jrke: An error occurred (#404): "Couldn't find the question related to this contribution". - lopidav
 lopidav: ok, cool, thx
 struct: Is this what happens when a  clash is removed?
 eulerscheZahl: and contribution, not just clash
 eulerscheZahl: pending/wip =&gt; delete (not refused)
 lopidav: oh, jrke, you approved this one!
 jacek: oO
 jrke: i didn't even remember when but yes i did that
 lopidav: eulerscheZahl, but this one is up and going. Got it in my clash, the solution got 85% on validators, and all tests green. Went to check out what's wrong and got this
 eulerscheZahl: ooh, interesting
 lopidav: It was deactivated for reverse tho. Maybe the deactivation process deletes too mush
 eulerscheZahl: (didn't click before, thought the initial link was broken already)
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't seen such a behavior before
 Astrobytes: Yes, that seems new.
 eulerscheZahl: "This contribution hasn’t received enough positive votes from the community. The "REVERSE" option has therefore been deactivated."
 eulerscheZahl: might be related to this
 struct: seems like my code, do one expected thing and break everything
 eulerscheZahl: but fastest+shortest are still active
 lopidav: maybe it has a wrong active version
 lopidav: it does, it works fine with active version 8 and below
 lopidav: also, my code wasn't working because one of the validators got a corner case that no tests were covering
 jacek: or your code had not enough if else
 Stilgart: lopidav: the deactivation process works as users tell
 Stilgart: and I doubt we can fix the users&#160;:(
 jacek: wait? it only deactives the mode? not entire clash?
 Stilgart: you can reactivate reverse mode by hand, though
 lopidav: one mode at a time 
 Stilgart: jacek: it's more logical this way
 Stilgart: some reverses were impossible
 lopidav: jacek my code had s&gt;0?s:-s and there was a possibility of s being 0
 lopidav: and my mistake was using js
 Stilgart: (input: daytime, output: angle between the hands)
 FireGhost_110b: hello world)
 Westicles: I notice they mostly speak english in #IN, instead of hindi or bengali.  So why is #fr so strict (no arabic allowed, for example)?
 eulerscheZahl: and discussing awesome new contribution ideas on #in
 eulerscheZahl: i guess exactly because they don't have just one language in India
 eulerscheZahl: watch the Jim Browning videos. sometimes they even talk to each other in English in person despite them knowing the same native language. different culture/mentality I would say
 Westicles: oh, I see. #fr means the language, not the country.  makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: i think country
 eulerscheZahl: create a new account, located in some french colony and see if you get added to #fr or only #world
 Westicles: But france is like 10% arabic speakers...
 eulerscheZahl: i'm from Germany and thus have 2 channels: #world and #deand can't even leave #de if I try
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: don't you have #po #pl or whatever your countrycode is?
 darkhorse64: "france is like 10% arabic speakers". This smells like pure bullshit. 
 jacek: in the chat here?
 jacek: its empty
 jacek: i have only the world tab
 eulerscheZahl: i have world and de that I can't close
 eulerscheZahl: no X, no /leave
 eulerscheZahl: when I try /leave:"You cannot leave this channel."
 jacek: being trapped in #de... thats the price for being mod
 eulerscheZahl: i could never leave
 eulerscheZahl: from day 1 of being on CG
 Westicles: darkhorse64, google says 5 million out of 65 million. close enough
 Westicles: If there was a #US, you would have to include spanish
 darkhorse64: wikipedia says 3.6&#160;%
 eulerscheZahl: rounding errors
 Westicles: speakers at home?  I think not
 Westicles: anyhow, no big deal.  those of us fighting for a diverse future know it will take take to come to fruition
 darkhorse64: alt-right wing rounding errors
 Westicles: *time
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you have those right wing parties inventing their own statistics too?
 Westicles: yeah, unfortunately
 eulerscheZahl: i meant frI know that you have Trump in the US
 struct: Arent they everywhere?
 darkhorse64: Yep, with tales like "great replacement"
 struct: They are starting to grow on Portugal too
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 eulerscheZahl: corona really gave them some boost&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Well, covid came from 5G Muslim alien broadcasts from Afghanistan you see
 Astrobytes: &lt;insert wild conspiracy here&gt;
 MSmits: this is why I didn't get it, no smartphone
 Westicles: You kid, but mm wave 5G really can shoot the eyeballs right out of your baby
 eulerscheZahl: bill gates *incoherent mumble* babies *more stuttering* pizza
 darkhorse64: and masks deplete oxygen in your brain so that goverment can control with the chip Bill Gates injects in your blood
 Westicles: Not from a phone, but repeaters have crazy amounts of antennas and beam sterring
 Westicles: steering
 MSmits: radio waves can only cause heating though
 MSmits: and very little of it
 eulerscheZahl: remote controlling a reporter :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9FBXb4G4GI&amp;ab_channel=Movieclips">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9FBXb4G4GI&amp;ab_channel=Movieclips</a>
 Westicles: you don't need much of a skin depth with eyeballs
 MSmits: it's all water, you can't heat water locally
 MSmits: heating the eyeballs means heating the body, unless you do it extremely fast
 MSmits: try doing that with radio waves
 Westicles: Usually not, but the beams are really tight.  The EIRP levels can get surprisingly high
 MSmits: will need to see evidence before i believe that
 MSmits: they're not lasers
 MSmits: the emitted power can't be focused that well
 eulerscheZahl: is that the moment when one has to say "there's plenty of evidence, just open your eyes"?
 Westicles: even just a phone can do +43 dBm, and that is like an inch from your eye.  I forget the limit for base stations, something like +78 dBm I think
 MSmits: whats dBm?
 Westicles: milliwatt decibels
 VizGhar: I've checked 6 CoC contributions and i feel depressed o.OThe CoC contributions should not give you 250XP... there is too much of them
 jacek: i presumed physics teacher would know that
 MSmits: we dont know every unit
 MSmits: google tells me thats about 100 mW
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: its logarithmic
 eulerscheZahl: i complained about that long ago VizGhar. CoC is much less effort than a full-blown multiplayer. they didn't listen to me
 MSmits: nvm
 jacek: shitty multiplayers would be worse than shitty CoCs
 Westicles: 43 dBm = 20W.  78 dBm=63kW
 MSmits: Westicles you should try to calculate how much time it takes to heat an eye by 1 degree celsius using your emitter
 MSmits: but also take into account the fraction of power actually received by the eye
 Westicles: It is a beam, so all of it
 MSmits: doubt that
 MSmits: eyes are small
 MSmits: these emitters must be pretty large
 MSmits: is it a dish? If so, the beam is not going to be tighter than the width of the dish
 Westicles: Beam steering.  That's the only way that stuff works, 40 GHz doesn't propagate very well
 struct: Is the code vs JP worth porting?
 struct: It was posted here before
 struct: Code vs Reborn*
 Astrobytes: that one was the one the JP guys were competing on?
 struct: yeah
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm35158232">https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm35158232</a>
 Astrobytes: Yeah I remember it. Don't see why not
 eulerscheZahl: might be a little too close to STC to be a relevant additino here
 eulerscheZahl: even in the attack mechanic looks more interesting there
 eulerscheZahl: not just 1 large attack and instant death
 struct: also you need to clear your "junk blocks" queue
 struct: before puting them on opponent
 eulerscheZahl: i still say: "we have STC"
 eulerscheZahl: but i also say we have CSB and some users liked bitrunner. so don't listen to me
 MSmits: if you do port a game like this struct, make it your own and test it well. Don't just copy it entirely
 MSmits: make really strong bots and see if you run into balance problems, boring games etc.
 MSmits: Like I am doing for connect4 atm 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a10c18d6-ab60-4696-b969-273929bc1120">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a10c18d6-ab60-4696-b969-273929bc1120</a>
 MSmits: (changed it to always pick the least visited starting move)
 MSmits: that way we can eventually see if a steal is a viable solution
 reCurse: STC is pretty bad so it would be good to replace, problem is no one will participate so who cares
 MSmits: well if it is a good game, people might
 reCurse: Let's not fool ourselves here
 Stilgart: I agree with reCurse&#160;:(
 MSmits: if you look at community multis, some get really popular, many dont, it's hard to predict. But you're right, a game like that would not be my favorite
 reCurse: The only games that are popular are contests
 Stilgart: reCurse: any idea about making STC better&#160;?
 reCurse: I certainly do
 struct: imo points for skulls are too cheap
 struct: or board too small
 reCurse: No and no
 Stilgart: MSmits: are you really sure about connect4&#160;?
 MSmits: what do you mean really sure? Whats your question?
 Stilgart: sounds more suitable as a puzzle
 MSmits: I am not really sure the 7x9 is big enough
 MSmits: but other than that it's fine
 struct: What is wrong with stc in your opinion re curse?
 Stilgart: I fear it is not competitive enough
 reCurse: sigh
 MSmits: what makes a game competitive Stilgart?
 Stilgart: to be honnest, I'd rather have connect4 as a multi so I can skip it
 MSmits: do you not like the mechanics?
 Stilgart: (I really dislike ported games)
 MSmits: We have many games that are equally complex
 Stilgart: but that is my personnal opinion
 Stilgart: still, I am not convinced that connect4 is even balanced
 MSmits: some sizes are solved as draw
 Stilgart: nor that bot will be discriminate properly
 Stilgart: I may totally be wrong, though
 Stilgart: ho, and draws are the worse
 MSmits: if its large enough and has steal, it will be balanced
 Stilgart: draws usually ruins it all
 MSmits: solved as draw doesnt mean all games are drawn
 Stilgart: what do you mean by steal&#160;?
 MSmits: like in yavalath
 MSmits: you play a move
 Stilgart: MSmits: it might suggest that avoiding to lose by forcing a draw should not be that hard
 MSmits: p2 can steal it
 MSmits: true Stilgart, but thats why you test
 Stilgart: on turn 1, or at every turn&#160;?
 MSmits: in 7x9 draws are extremely rare, i havent been able to force one
 MSmits: turn 1
 MSmits: so that means that if one move is extremely in favor of p1, p1 will not play it
 Stilgart: this should help balacing
 MSmits: he will be forced to play the most balanced move, if it exists
 MSmits: also called pie rule
 MSmits: it would in fact solve the uttt problem
 MSmits: (of p1 almost always winning)
 MSmits: but 7x9 connect 4 only has 5 starts, so 1 might not be balanced enough
 MSmits: thats why maybe it needs to be bigger and have steal to fix all issues
 Stilgart: well, you seem to have fun at least&#160;:)
 MSmits: well i enjoy simple games. It might not be the case for others
 Stilgart: especially those doing RAIC :p
 jacek: mhm
 Stilgart: ho, nice... recar 2nd and aropan 6th
 Astrobytes: is R4N4 still playing?
 MSmits: raic seems too complicated most of the time, for me anyway. I dont like writing huge sims
 Stilgart: &lt;/lag&gt;
 Stilgart: too time consuming for a mere human
 Stilgart: even AutomatonNN fears RAIC
 AutomatonNN: who to help with that puzzle?
 Stilgart:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I quite enjoyed it tbh
 Stilgart: It might be quite enjoyable
 Astrobytes: Once I got used to the bizarre API
 Stilgart: is this that bad&#160;?
 Stilgart: (not the first time I read this)
 Astrobytes: It's... unintuitive. 
 Stilgart: is that cultural&#160;?
 Astrobytes: When you figure it out, it's OK but still leaves me shaking my head.
 Stilgart: I mean, it might be that it is in fact intuitive for russians
 Westicles: I'd like to see someone port the google AI ants here, that one was fun
 Astrobytes: No, I don't think so. It's just rather awkward to use.
 Astrobytes: But don't quote me on that, you'd have to ask some of the #ru guys.
 Stilgart: might be intended to avoid not so good players, then
 MrSok: :P Stilgart
 Stilgart: (strangely enough, MK is not pinging in PM yet)
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Give it an hour
 Stilgart: MrSok \o/
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://ants.aichallenge.org/">http://ants.aichallenge.org/</a>
 Astrobytes: Westicles: the RAIC this year would also make a good CG game, albeit simpler
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: BotG :scream:
 Stilgart: too complicated is a nigthmare on CG
 Astrobytes: Stilgart: That game. Oh dear, oh dear.
 Astrobytes: The idea of this RAIC was not particularly complex.
 Stilgart: it seems like CR in more complicated
 Stilgart: and CR was already complicated enough
 Astrobytes: CR was too complicated, I agree. But the RAIC can be simplified a lot. There was so much useless information in the inputs.
 Astrobytes: *useless/needless
 MSmits: code royale?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 MSmits: mmh, wasn't the worst. 
 reCurse: *code _royale :P
 MSmits: lol
 Stilgart: free hl for the win 
 MSmits: i think code royale was painful if you wanted to do a proper search
 Astrobytes: Westicles: ants looks like it would also be quite interesting, I didn't play it.
 MSmits: yeah it certainly does. One day I want to make a serious attempt at PR-2. Want to learn how to do those multi agent games
 Westicles: It was fun for a beginner, didn't take much to get a decent start
 reCurse: But they don't have opening books
 MSmits: bah
 MSmits: my uttt bot still beats yours without a book reCurse :P
 reCurse: Allegedly
 Astrobytes: Smits would have some kind of map-type detection and book accordingly anyway.
 MSmits: kinda hard to prove ofc&#160;:)
 MSmits: I just think those games look cool
 MSmits: gitc too, no idea how to write a good bot for that either
 MSmits: someone barely pushed me into gold and thats it
 reCurse: Why is there so much demand on cpu and gpus...
 jacek: btc over 30k
 struct: high demand low supply
 MSmits: ye but he asked why
 reCurse: Never been so difficult to upgrade in like ever
 MSmits: how's moores law doing? Is there even a point to upgrading?
 reCurse: Doing pretty good it just expands horizontally
 reCurse: Even a bit vertically
 MSmits: what does it mean to expand horizontally? Just more chips and power?
 reCurse: Threading
 MSmits: ah right
 reCurse: Could really use 32 cores and a rtx 3080
 reCurse: Maybe this summer if I'm lucky? sigh
 MSmits: do you mean lucky because you cant find one available?
 MSmits: or because you're expecting a bonus at work 
 Westicles: Moore's law ending messed up supply
 reCurse: No lucky because it's impossibel to find
 MSmits: ah ok
 struct: in portugal only 3090 is available
 struct: rest out of stock too
 reCurse: Yeah 3090 are still approchable for availability
 reCurse: Just ridiculous pricing
 reCurse: 2k for a gpu that doesn't do that much more than 3080
 MSmits: might this be covid related? Some problem in the supply chain?
 reCurse: Probably...
 reCurse: It was a rhetorical question sorry
 reCurse: Just frustration
 Astrobytes: guess I'll be upgrading when the UK regains it's status as a world-beating economic superpower after Brexit-ing. Oh, wait...
 Westicles: I guess the real problem is all these data centers
 reCurse: I mean 3950x are available, problem is it's zen2
 reCurse: And zen2 has terrible bmi instructions
 reCurse: I mean garbage tier level
 MSmits: it's been projected that half my country's use of energy will go to datacenters
 MSmits: in 2050
 MSmits: someone thought it would be a good idea for microsoft to plant their :poop:  here
 reCurse: Nuking social media would help for that
 MSmits: already on that
 Astrobytes: watch out for those baby-eating Clinton-Gates hybrids spitting 5G covid pizzas at you MSmits.
 MSmits: will do Astrobytes
 Westicles: You kid, but pizzagate was really a thing.  Kill your baby from across the table
 reCurse: I repeat, nuking social media would help.
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: I liek nice people with candies in white vans
 Astrobytes: Yeah reCurse, I can't see 'social media' going anywhere in the near future
 MSmits: I really detest this part of society
 struct: What do you mean by going anywhere? Improving?
 struct: or stop growing
 Astrobytes: Leaving.
 reCurse: There has to be a way
 MSmits: Astrobytes means it's here to stay
 struct: ah I see
 Astrobytes: It's the new television.
 Westicles: Wait, what are we doing right now?  Irony is leaking
 reCurse: Don't insult television like that
 reCurse: That's not quite social media, at least how it's used for the most part
 Astrobytes: Trust you to be pedantic there Westicles :P
 MSmits: Westicles this is not what we mean though. We're here to code and chat about that mostly, the social part is a side effect 
 reCurse: At this rate you'll classify emails as social media
 MSmits: we mean the political, religious, conspiratorial bubble people get into
 reCurse: But I suspect you're trolling
 MSmits: at least i think that is what we mean
 jacek: why would he
 MSmits: the fact that most people cant even decide whats true and whats not anymore
 reCurse: I include youtubers and streamers and influencers in all that, Msmits
 MSmits: same
 Astrobytes: +1000000
 reCurse: Not quite the same bubbles you pointed out
 MSmits: i was also intending youtube
 MSmits: streamers too
 MSmits: plenty of political and conspiracy streaming
 Westicles: reddit is the worst.  you don't get any more groupthing than that
 reCurse: I also exclude those actually delievering information even though I'm aware it makes the line extremely vague
 Astrobytes: People would rather pay to watch people doing/saying things than actually do anything themselves it would seem.
 MSmits: well thats not limited to social media
 MSmits: watching sports is the same
 MSmits: and thats older than we are
 reCurse: If it relies on likes and subscribes it's probably social media
 Astrobytes: I've never fully understood that one either, frankly.
 MSmits: I can kind of understand watchign other people do things, if it's something that interests you
 MSmits: i dont do it much though
 Astrobytes: Up to a certain point.
 MSmits: yea
 Westicles: Sports is turning more and more into just betting
 Astrobytes: But with a youtube/twitch chat scrolling past at 12000 lines/s it's not exactly sociable is it?
 reCurse: There's a good explanation for that though
 reCurse: I read a comparison to cheering in a stadium
 Westicles: People are shedding religion like crazy, you have to fill it with something
 reCurse: It's quite relatable in that sense
 MSmits: youtube is not really bi-directional social media, it's more that the algorithm pushes you into a corner
 Astrobytes: That I can understand. It's still not particularly social though.
 MSmits: you're right it's not
 reCurse: The algorithm is fine, it's content exploiting it
 MSmits: the algorithm works yes
 Astrobytes: Another pet peeve of mine from the media in general: "THE ALGORITHM DID IT"
 MSmits: many people are not smart enough to withstand it though
 MSmits: people honestly think they are doing research
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: youtube's main role is to earn as much money as possible, so they would reccomend anything as long as it has the highest click/watch rate
 MSmits: when clicking through videos
 Astrobytes: Like the algorithm in question is some kind of malevolent sentient codebase that is just crushing us all.
 Astrobytes: So true MSmits.
 Astrobytes: and ZzzTRAPzzZ true also.
 MSmits: ZzzTRAPzzZ many companies don't actually want their product to get people addicted to conspiracy theories, but that's what makes the most money
 MSmits: they know it might hurt their image in the long run
 Astrobytes: Who cares about that if you have the market cornered and make shitloads of money.
 MSmits: governments might take action
 MSmits: thats the risk
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: it's a tradeoff, either quick money, but then die out quick coz bad reputation, or a stable fair product that will last but has a very slow growth I think
 MSmits: there is a reason twitter is marking tweets now and youtube is banning users
 Astrobytes: I've yet to see a government properly stand up to a huge tech company in recent times.
 MSmits: the misinformation is also hurting them
 reCurse: Call me cynical but is there that much difference between a government and a corporation at this point?
 MSmits: reCurse depends a lot on the government
 Astrobytes: Almost none, reCurse.
 MSmits: governments are very different
 MSmits: from eachother
 Astrobytes: Are they?
 reCurse: Wherever the power is located it gets corrupted
 MSmits: yeah they sure are
 MSmits: I can honestly say the corruption in my government is pretty minimal compared to the rest of the world. It's there, but minimal 
 Astrobytes: They're all vulnerable to business/corporate influence.
 MSmits: that's true, to a degree
 reCurse: You can say that?
 reCurse: Or is it that they're successful?
 MSmits: i've seen scandals here
 MSmits: but the worst scandals are every day stuff in most countries
 MSmits: thats what I mean
 reCurse: Or what's actually public
 MSmits: we have an extremely open society. I doubt that they are that good at hiding things
 MSmits: but anything is possible i guess
 Westicles: There is a weird thing going on with govt's and corps.  Corps are still trying to make money, while govt's figured out they can print infinite money without consequence.  It really doesn't make much sense
 reCurse: ...
 reCurse: Print infinite money without consequence
 reCurse: Ok...
 MSmits: Westicles is overstating it, but yeah, there is some vicious cycle there
 Westicles: The US debt passed the sum total of all real estate in the country, and most EU countries are worse off
 MSmits: it's pretty important to know who the debt is to, though
 MSmits: often the government has a debt to its own citizens
 MSmits: just raise taxes and pay them with it&#160;:)
 Westicles: Right.  And if you have your own currency.  Shared currency is a mess
 MSmits: all currency is shared
 MSmits: what would be the point of currency?
 MSmits: if it is not shared?
 Westicles: I mean like the euro
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: should all US states have their own dollar?
 MSmits: Euro being shared has pro's and cons, there were good reasons to do it and good reasons not to
 Westicles: They can't afford to.  They would have to pay off their&#160;% of US debt to leave (without a war at least)
 Astrobytes: Yes, I'm not convinced on the euro either.The US has always seemed to me to be impossible to run fairly. Since it is indeed a collection of country-sized states.
 MACTEP: Hi!
 MSmits: they have states with  &lt; 1M population
 MSmits: quite a few actually
 MSmits: country sized in surface area only
 Astrobytes: Yes, but that's not my point. There are vastly different cultures around the US, and almost no accounting for that by cetral govt. I know they have state control over some things but it seems like a ripe old mess to me.
 Astrobytes: *central
 MSmits: sure, but anything that big is going to be a ripe old mess
 MSmits: i think it's quite an achievement that it's still around
 Toby75: Could someone who has time have a look at my contribution? It just needs one approval, would be amazing! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/601786a4d4ff9aad79068c73b80a5727e0be">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/601786a4d4ff9aad79068c73b80a5727e0be</a>
 Astrobytes: Considering the damage their govt's have inflicted on everyone else it is nothing short of miraculous :P
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: well size helps with this part
 MSmits: if you're big and strong, noone messes with you
 Astrobytes: Still? 
 MSmits: it still does yeah
 MSmits: militarily anyway
 Astrobytes: They are considerably weaker than before.
 MSmits: dont they still have a stronger military than the next 9 countries combined?
 reCurse: You should witness that firsthand
 reCurse: No? :P
 reCurse: Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: The damage part reCurse?
 reCurse: Size and strength
 reCurse: EU vs UK
 Astrobytes: Aha, gotcha
 Astrobytes: Well, we also have a delusional administration. I can't say anything else in defence.
 Westicles: Hah, pretty rich EU complaining about US power.  We are the only ones in a position to save you&#160;:)
 MSmits: we are not complaining Westicles
 MSmits: just describing
 Westicles: You got two hordes right there ready to take you
 MSmits: also, there is not really a *we*, half of the US is an ally of Russia it seems
 Astrobytes: The UK is not in the EU. We are now your slaves. Also China. And Russia. And anyone else who feels like it.
 reCurse: Really not much to be proud about in the US right now
 Westicles: Why not?
 Astrobytes: Westicles: I'm far from anti-American, it's just some of your administrations have been... Highly Questionable.
 reCurse: If you identify as conservative I'm not even going to bother
 reCurse: Might as well talk to a wall
 MSmits: Westicles half of the US thinks your president has been chosen with a fraudulent election
 Westicles: There is no difference in the two parties.  It is an artificial line drawn to divide a population in half, as required with two parties
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: that's never been less true than it is now Westicles
 MSmits: there's a huge difference
 reCurse: Ah yes the good old all sides are equally bad
 Westicles: Trump just spent 9 trillion
 reCurse: Peace out
 Westicles: Jeez, talk about hurray for your side...
 MSmits: I'm not going to get into a political debate defending any side on this chat, but to say that it's all the same is not realistic
 reCurse: ^
 MSmits: the US is extremely divided
 Westicles: It isn't the same because your side is right (just to make it clear, I don't have a side)
 Westicles: Anyhow, wrong place for this
 MSmits: what i mean is, people identify with one side, only see news from that side, only socialize with people from that side etc.
 Astrobytes: I agree that 2-party solutions are not workable.
 MSmits: it's like a religion to most Americans
 reCurse: Not a reason for false equivalence and inaction
 reCurse: Or apathy
 MSmits: I'm happy with our mess of a multi-party system
 Westicles: MSmits, agreed that is the best way to do it
 Astrobytes: Here in Scotland, we have, I believe, 50 MPs from the SNP (dominant party in scotland) in the UK parliament. And it's like banging your head against a brick wall.
 MSmits: while playing the bagpipes
 Astrobytes: No.
 MSmits: mmh ok
 MSmits: just my imagination then
 Astrobytes: More like having porridge being chucked at you :P
 MSmits: ahh that works
 reCurse: If you play the bagpipes it's totally warranted
 reCurse: Just saying
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: Hey, I can't play but I do enjoy the bagpipes.
 decomorreno: Hi guys is it considered cheating to use google (stackoverflow)? I cant find any info about this
 MSmits: decomorreno depends to what degree
 Astrobytes: No, use stackoverflow to your heart's content.
 reCurse: Is programming considered cheating?
 MSmits: if you're copying entire bots, it's not really sporting
 Astrobytes: Yes. Someone wrote this code before.
 MSmits: but to find a function to do a task is fine
 reCurse: That's literally how I write java and javascript
 Astrobytes: if (... OH HELL I'M CHEATING. I must invent an esolang
 decomorreno: Understandable, thx&#160;:) 
 Centurion256: why did the chat get so political all of a sudden, it feels like i'm scrolling through my twitter feed again...
 MSmits: i think it's done now
 Astrobytes: hehe, sorry about that
 MSmits: sorry about that Centurion256, you're right to complain
 Astrobytes: It happens once in a while
 Westicles: stackoverflow is fine, github is cheating
 reCurse: I complained about not being able to upgrade computers, my bad
 Astrobytes: :D
 Westicles: lol
 Astrobytes: Conversation is as conversation does 
 Westicles: everything went widdershins
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Excellent.
 Centurion256: don't get me wrong, I wasn't blaming it on anyone, it's just unusual to see this kind of discussion in codingame chat out of all places&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah, I like that it is unusual
 reCurse: No it's true, by blaming social media we have become what we hate
 reCurse: So social media is now joining politics in topics to avoid, interesting
 MSmits: I sometimes can't resist joining in because I have strong opinions too, but this is not really the place
 Westicles: Yeah, it was kind of beautiful how that transitioned
 Astrobytes: Haha 
 Astrobytes: Where is 'the place' MSmits?
 MSmits: in your cupboard, when everyone is away
 MSmits: and when you're voting
 MSmits: or just scream in your pillow
 Astrobytes: I've always advocated conversation about everything wherever you are (within reason of course)
 MSmits: yeah, but if you know beforehand that it's not going to do anyone any good, it's maybe better not to start
 Astrobytes: But it's conversation nonetheless. Why hide under a veil of silence if you have something to say?
 MSmits: I don't mind talking about simple political facts, but people cant agree on facts anymore
 Astrobytes: Some can.
 MSmits: yeah, but then you're usually in your own bubble
 Astrobytes: That's why it's important to converse.
 Westicles: I like that one guy last month: "You guys were gonna ban me for asking how to print yesterday but now you're talking about bombs?"
 MSmits: It is my opinion that you cant converse when you dont share the same facts
 Astrobytes: lol Westicles, I remember.
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: he said that?
 MSmits: thats awesome
 MSmits: so... about bombs
 MSmits: what were you discussing?
 Astrobytes: MSmits: yes, I get that. However, when you fail to engage you lose all hope of any kind of progression.
 MSmits: I agree, but I think all effort should go to creating places where facts are central
 MSmits: werent you the one that keeps sharing links from The Guardian?
 MSmits: I like that one
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's the only publication I take seriously. Well, one of the few.
 MSmits: there should be a lot of effort to create those
 MSmits: to lure people away from their misinformation bubbles. I dont think there can be conversation before that happens
 MSmits: it seems pointless
 Astrobytes: There are more fundamental issues though. People are tired, scared, deprived of education - of course they will look for a quick way out. That's populism.
 MSmits: education too, yes
 MSmits: good point
 Astrobytes: The less educated most of your country is, the better the hold you have over it.
 MSmits: and the faster you'll lose it to the next populist
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 Astrobytes: Up to a point.
 Astrobytes: It takes time to swing from the far left/far right.
 MSmits: it might still appear sudden to other people
 MSmits: most of it happens in your head, suddenly you're fed up with the BS
 MSmits:  many people might be close to that and you wouldn't even know
 Astrobytes: True. Then in retrospect people say "wtf, why didn't we see that coming".
 Astrobytes: And yes.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I really do despair. Let's move on.
 MSmits: good idea
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d1f34c6b-f0a2-4a0e-826c-76ee4b367d79">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d1f34c6b-f0a2-4a0e-826c-76ee4b367d79</a>
 MSmits: update on my connect4 test&#160;:)
 MSmits: that first move seems more balanced, been that way for a while
 Astrobytes: explain, I haven't been following your progress too closely today
 MSmits: left corner
 MSmits: I am trying to determine if this is one of those games where p1 always wins
 MSmits: and if it needs a steal
 MSmits: like yavalath
 Astrobytes: Ah ok, the balancing issue.
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: when i let my bot play itself in the IDE, p1 almost always wins
 MSmits: thats not good
 Astrobytes: and offline?
 MSmits: well thats the link i shared, it's a meta mcts
 MSmits: it's just playing games
 Astrobytes: ah of course
 MSmits: 4 is the middle, apparently not the best move
 MSmits: 3 seems better, my bot also always uses it
 MSmits: corner is understandably weakest
 MSmits: so maybe p1 needs to be forced to play it, to have a balanced game. Steal does this
 Astrobytes: Interesting. Any literature on that?
 MSmits: well this is a peculiar size for connect 4
 MSmits: usually it's 6x7 isnt it?
 MSmits: it depends  alot on size
 Astrobytes: There have been a few variants
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html">https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html</a>
 MSmits: here you can see the various sizes
 MSmits: + means p1 solved win
 MSmits: - p2 solved win
 MSmits: = draw
 Astrobytes: Yeah I saw that previously
 MSmits: 9x7 is just out of range of this
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: well that shows you that it depends  a lot on size
 MSmits: so, likely what move is best, also does
 Astrobytes: I would recommend trying to add  steal in your offline sim and see the difference.
 Astrobytes: Also with board size differences if necessary.
 MSmits: dont need to, i can just look at the starting moves. The move nearest 50% is always the best move to pick with steal
 Astrobytes: ah, heh, smart thinking
 MSmits: different board sizes will be hard
 MSmits: i would need to rewrite my bot
 MSmits: it uses AVX on a 64 bit board
 MSmits: 7x9 = 63
 Astrobytes: eh, yeah
 MSmits: i dont mind rewriting it for a larger version if thats what we're going it, but not unless we're sure, its a lot of work
 Astrobytes: (and I can still do basic arithmetic btw)
 MSmits: lol i know
 MSmits: i am doing it because of jacek, he might read this
 MSmits: he has math problems
 Astrobytes: Yeah, larger boards would really be a pain in the arse
 Astrobytes: It's just symbols he hates no?
 MSmits: yeah, i am just trolling him
 Astrobytes: ah
 MSmits: i think its not too hard to split the board in two
 MSmits: and do the procedures twice
 MSmits: combine the result
 MSmits: but it means less sims
 MSmits: and you need to be careful around the split
 MSmits: 4 in a rows may cross boundaries
 MSmits: likely you would have shared bits in both halves
 Astrobytes: That's the point where my head begins to spin with bitboarding.
 MSmits: yeah i cant say i have done that before, usually on these boardgames it neatly fits
 MSmits: tric trac hasnt passed us yet
 MSmits:  i wonder if he just hasnt properly tried his MM magic
 MSmits: or if mcts is a better fit
 Astrobytes: I would go with the former.
 MSmits: probably
 Astrobytes: For now.
 MSmits: my bot is only 669 lines
 MSmits: really small for me
 MSmits: the sim is so simple is why
 MSmits: and no eval
 Astrobytes: That's because it only has 0x,&amp;,!,| and =
 MSmits: well that
 Astrobytes: oh and &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;
 MSmits: and this:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c9a5e2be-612e-4fc8-a4a0-88fd2a1aa51f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c9a5e2be-612e-4fc8-a4a0-88fd2a1aa51f</a>
 Astrobytes: ah, yes, always better to call those heinous things something meaningful
 MSmits: i normally never uses defines
 MSmits: but for these... yeah
 Astrobytes: you can do using instead, but not sure it matters, frankly
 MSmits: how does that work?
 MSmits: i know it in python
 MSmits: never done that in C++
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type_alias">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type_alias</a>
 MSmits: oh specifically for types
 MSmits: define is more general i guess
 Astrobytes: read on
 MSmits: this makes my head hurt
 MSmits: more than bitboards :P
 Astrobytes: well, like I said, not really necessary
 darkhorse64: For boards larger than 64, you can use encoding under several directions  using as many uint64_t as you want. That deals with the straddle issues.
 Astrobytes: Hm. Good point.
 MSmits: hmm
 Astrobytes: Much less confusing.
 MSmits: but every part of the board still has possible 4 in a rows in most directions doesnt it?/
 MSmits: oh wait i get it, you want to split it several ways
 MSmits: split it horizontally for vertical 4 in a row checking
 darkhorse64: Of course, you lose performance because you need to update 4 different representation. Yes
 MSmits: ah i got it
 MSmits: also you wont be saving the board on your node anymore
 MSmits: I tend to put the limit on 128 bit for saving states on nodes
 MSmits: i dont do it for uttt for example
 darkhorse64: I wanted to make a C4 octagon with size 5 (much larger than 64). So I started thinking on the bot implementation
 MSmits: oh, how does this octagon thing work, do you have an example?
 MSmits: you mentioned it before
 darkhorse64: Same behaviour, you drop things vertically. No gravity drift
 MSmits: yeah but i mean, whats the octagon part
 MSmits: having trouble imagining it
 darkhorse64: It's like a bigger rectangle with forbidden slots
 MSmits: hmm ok, so it widens as you go up?
 MSmits: and shrinks again at the top?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: well it could be interesting, but might suffer from any problem connect4 has on a board that is too small
 MSmits: so size is still the solution to any problem
 MSmits: but the game might be interesting to people who feel connect4 is too simple
 darkhorse64: In the hope that the strange shape and the larger board will prevent solving. I reckon balancing can still be an issue
 MSmits: strange shape shouldnt matter, larger board will
 MSmits: well it will matter in the sense that you wont find example bots online
 Astrobytes: Alright then, MöbiusConnect4 it is
 darkhorse64: It's a new programming challenge for bitboarders
 MSmits: thats true
 MSmits: though pdep/pext fixes most issues with strange boards
 MSmits: worked with yavalath as well
 Astrobytes: fair point
 MSmits: avx will be far harder though
 MSmits: i wonder if there's any way to extrapolate from the solving table here&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html">https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html</a>
 MSmits: it does seem draws disappear at larger sizes
 MSmits: but p1 and p2 both win, depending on size
 Astrobytes: D&amp;B-style odd/even thing going on?
 MSmits: yeah seemed like it
 MSmits: it's not obvious at all, just looking at the game
 MSmits: you would think p1 would always have the advantage, but thats not true at all
 MSmits: these things fascinate me. I am just like those guys who make those pages. Spending years solving all the different sizes of a game
 darkhorse64: Notice that with tx6, only the middle move wins, whereas nearly all moves wins (except the borders) with 9x7 according to your sim
 darkhorse64: 7x6
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: well its too early to tell, but does seem that way 
 MSmits: it might be p2 has some narrow lines to victory
 darkhorse64: My bot always plays 3 at startup
 MSmits: mine too
 MSmits: it plays the wrong reply as p2 though
 MSmits: mine i mean
 MSmits: sems 5 is best, but mine stacks on top
 darkhorse64: I hardcoded naively 4 but your bot made me change my mind
 MSmits: 4 is probably winning too
 MSmits: but could be 3 is more forgiving, which is why the&#160;% is higher
 darkhorse64: _mm256_set1_epi64x(board) looks faster than _mm256_set_epi64x(board,board,board,board)
 MSmits: we'll see, I'll leave it running until the contribution is approved or rejected
 MSmits: it's probably faster or equally fast
 MSmits: compiler might catch it
 Stilgart: darkhorse64: it would be a shame that the first one is slower
 MSmits: yeah, why would it even exist if it was slower heh
 MSmits: I had to convert my avx sim to something in C#. I noticed C# now gives access to these functions
 MSmits: I didnt want to learn how though... so i rewrote everything to loops :P
 darkhorse64: I now beat consistently trictrac as p2. Yes, you are right, it's getting late, silly me
 struct: darkhorse64 they are both a sequence
 struct: I dont think it matters
 darkhorse64: a sequence&#160;?
 struct: "This intrinsic generates a sequence of instructions, which may perform worse than a native instruction. Consider the performance impact of this intrinsic."
 MSmits: mmh i wonder how it would perform worse
 MSmits: under which conditions
 MSmits: I only use it once during the winning moves function, to fill the 256 register
 struct: also if you are loading from an array[4]
 struct: you can use gather
 darkhorse64: On CG, it performs ~8% better just changing this very line but stills far from the improvement avx give me on my machine
 MSmits: is that just a memcpy struct?
 struct: wait i was wrong
 struct: gather lets you load from indexes of array
 struct: _mm256_i64gather_epi64 (__int64 const* base_addr, __m256i vindex, const int scale)
 MSmits: yeah so its just loading from any sequential piece of memory basically
 MSmits: like memcpy
 Astrobytes: like a memcpy
 Astrobytes: sorry, too late&#160;:(
 MSmits: it's ok, then we know you're still around
 darkhorse64: echo in the chat
 struct: I guess, but the indexes dont have to be sequential
 struct: you can load from 0, 5, 100, 200
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: but then it's slow
 Astrobytes: aha
 struct: but if load alligned memory
 struct: you can use load
 MSmits: I see
 struct: Im not sure if it works with 64 ints though
 MSmits: but for connect4, we're basically loading from 1 64 bit bitboard
 struct: loadu loads from unaligned memory
 MSmits: we're just spreading that thing around the register to have 4 copies
 struct: I see
 struct: So I guess set1 is enough
 MSmits: that way you can use shifts and such to check in all 4 directions at once
 struct: you load the same board in all 4?
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: and then check a different direction for each?
 MSmits: thats what i do yeah
 MSmits: left + up,  + upleft + upright
 MSmits: it's all a shift in the same direction
 MSmits: with different amounts
 MSmits: so you can use the shift function, with a shift array with different counts
 MSmits: shift 1, shfit 9, shfit 8, shift 10
 darkhorse64: 8 lines + 9 constants
 MSmits: 9 constants?

 darkhorse64: for guarding bits, shifts, etc
 struct: Those are the differences
 struct: bettwen set1 and set
 MSmits: you mean masks darkhorse64?

 Astrobytes: Right. This is too much for my rum and Rammstein clouded mind. I bid you gn/bn people
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes&#160;:)
 Stilgart: gn Astrobytes
 darkhorse64: gn
 struct: gn
 MSmits: darkhorse64, instead of having a shift 2, isnt it better to shift once, then shift again?
 MSmits: if you're using the earlier result anyway
 MSmits: then you use 1 less register
 MSmits: those things you call guards, look like my masks to avoid shifting over the edge of the board, is that what they do&gt;/
 MSmits: yeah that must be it
 darkhorse64: Yes. I shift once, for lines of two and a second time for lines of 4 reusing the previous result
 MSmits: your "all" is my: const uint64_t FULL = 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF;
 MSmits: I use hex to not have such long lines hehe
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: your function does a different thing
 darkhorse64: Easier to write bit by bit
 MSmits: mine works like this
 darkhorse64: it's a win detection
 MSmits: each part of the board has 4 ways it can be part of a 4 in a row
 MSmits: (in 1 direction)
 MSmits: it shifts all of the other 3 parts of the board to it
 MSmits: and with AND sees, if a 4 in a row is possible on this spot
 MSmits: so 0XXX and X0XX and XX0X and 00X
 MSmits: so I need 4 results times 4 directions
 MSmits: that last one was wrong bw XXX0 ofc
 struct: darkhorse the 8% difference is on same cpu?
 struct: and how often do you load the board?
 MSmits: might be an intel amd thing?
 darkhorse64: I have repeated the test around ten times. I know about CG 3 different CPUs. I load the board each time I play a move during rollouts. It's really a hot spot
 darkhorse64: *about*
 struct: its 5 cpus
 MSmits: same for me, i do the winningmoves thing every time i play a move also
 MSmits: btw darkhorse64, do you save the board on the node?
 struct: but I see, loading everytime might make a bit performance hit
 darkhorse64: Yeah, it might be very accurate. I'll do it on my machine although it seems to perform much better
 MSmits: I've been thinking about maybe incrementally change the winningmoves thing as opposed to just recalculating the entire board
 MSmits: but anything i think of seems slower
 darkhorse64: I do that for Y
 MSmits: me too
 MSmits: i have a winboard, a loss board a trap board etc.
 MSmits: doesnt seem feasible here
 darkhorse64: same
 darkhorse64: I reread the code this afternoon. Ouch&#160;!
 MSmits: yeah, i will never understand the code i use to generate my lookup tables again
 MSmits: at first i manually coded them at risk of errors, because it seemed too hard to generate them
 MSmits: but finally got tired of those huge tables, spent a day on it and never looked back
 darkhorse64: No but my implementation is bare bones
 MSmits: what do you mean
 darkhorse64: lag. Answering a previous question on storing board on node
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: well i think it doesnt really matter in this case
 MSmits: because you're updating those winboards and such anyway
 MSmits: thats way more expensive than updating a normal board
 darkhorse64: I think too, A xor plus one update for heights
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: oh now that you mention it, i dont think i save the board on the node here either
 MSmits: confused with oware, bandas and such
 MSmits: they are also 128 bit
 darkhorse64: At first, I only have two boards but I thought managing available moves would be beneficial
 darkhorse64: *only had*
 MSmits: yeah it definitely is, mostly in the random rollout
 MSmits: but when the selection tree goes deep, it does get pretty expensive
 darkhorse64: which makes me think it could be efficient in uttt
 MSmits: hmm, yes, thats what that page did i think
 MSmits: someone shared something
 MSmits: i forgot who
 oscarf24: Hey y'all

 MSmits: this part:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pruning/">https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pruning/</a>
 MSmits: you keep track of critical squares
 MSmits: to avoid playing
 MSmits: reduces branching in the rollout
 MSmits: basically, if you know the other guy has a winning square in some board, you avoid playing any square leading to that board, including all free moves
 darkhorse64: I have that in my rollouts, avoid sending opponent to winning boards but it's quite heavy and not very beneficial. As usual, a game give clues to another
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: not very beneficial might be beneficial enough
 MSmits: i tried thinking about endgame db for uttt
 MSmits: but i cant see anything past just the last unfinished board
 MSmits: the number of possibilities with 2 unfinished boards is extremely large
 MSmits: doable locally, for sure, but not in 1 second on CG
 darkhorse64: It hampers my rollout count too much
 MSmits: ah I see
 MSmits: maybe i should not have my meta mcts bot for connect4 run at 100 ms per turn, this takes forever&#160;:)
 MSmits: I sometimes make them run much faster locally, since it doesnt seem to cause problems
 darkhorse64: But if I can get available moves faster ... I really need to think about your winning position code. I understand it but bitboarding it is another story and it's getting late
 MSmits: you'll wake up with the code in your head
 MSmits: happened to me a few times, very rare, but awesome 
 reCurse: Drugs are bad mmkay?
 MSmits: hey, some people dont need drugs for this :P
 MSmits: did this never happen to you during a contest?
 reCurse: No that's what showers are for
 MSmits: ah well that works too
 darkhorse64: Is CG a drug&#160;? Tooth brushing is my favorite
 AnonymousUser: Some drugs good, some drugs bad
 AnonymousUser: ez
 MSmits: allright I should get some sleep. 
 MSmits: gn&#160;!

 XIlayPVPX: yo, so I'm trying this AI game
 XIlayPVPX: it keeps saying I'm 1# at wood league
 XIlayPVPX: how do I try a "Bronze game" like the website wants me to
 struct: you need to be above the boss
 struct: after all matches end if you are above it you will get promoted
 XIlayPVPX: it took a bit of time to update
 XIlayPVPX: I got the promotion in a 5 minutes delay xd
 gusto: is the site slow for others as well?
 AbuuDarda: yeah its slow
 DJSchaffner: yeah my tests take ages to complete. and i already thought i screwed up something :D
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: bruh the site is too slow
 onlyspaceGHOST: it's normally ok
 onlyspaceGHOST: it's fine for me now 
 onlyspaceGHOST: was bad earlier

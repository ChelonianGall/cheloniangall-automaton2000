 martinpapa69: morning
 martinpapa69: any rust expert in the chat?
 DarkMatriac: Whats the difference between a uint8_t , uint_fast8_t and uint_least8_t?
 Newbiegod: good morning worldddddddd
 Wontonimo: gn, it's late for me
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: 9 am in me
 struct: DarkMatriac they are all different
 struct: uint8_t is always 8 bits, uint_fast8_t will use the fastest unsigned that is at least 8 bits and the least will give you an unsigned that is at least 8 bits
 struct: I would always use uint8_t though, less prune to bugs
 struct: or better I would use the type that needs the bits that I require
 struct: But sometimes bigger can be faster

 KiL3: how hard is python certification
 KiL3: what are challenges there
 5DN1L: the public one is mostly on basic stuff
 KiL3: yeaa that tutorial on returning value closest to 0 temperature is easy
 KiL3: are they like that one or
 KiL3:&#160;?
 5DN1L: yes, similar or just slightly harder
 KiL3: cool
 KiL3: these are fun challenges
 KiL3: tnx for input
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 KiL3: did you get anything from spending time here
 KiL3: liek learned anything
 5DN1L: yeah
 KiL3: do you know some challenge that is math heavy
 KiL3: like medium challenge
 KiL3: is it possible to look for math heavy challenges
 KiL3: in some way
 KiL3: like vectors, matrices, derivations, integrals

 KiL3: unfortunatley i didnt work on c== yet but tnx, as intro to programming on my college we use python
 KiL3: it was C before but they switched to python
 5DN1L: well you can still check out the test cases and solve it offline using python :P
 KiL3: thats true
 KiL3: tnx for your time
 5DN1L: No problem&#160;:)
 KiL3: you got a follower for helping
 KiL3:&#160;:)
 5DN1L: :smiley:
 KiL3: wthhh ahhahaha xD i just checked your achiv hahaha
 KiL3: do you live on this page ahah
 KiL3: are you likeworking for them
 KiL3: ahaha
 KiL3: not a proffesional xD
 KiL3: how in the hell do you find so much time to spend here if you dont code for a living hahah
 5DN1L: it's not like i do it all over one single day
 5DN1L: and there are coders better than me
 KiL3: ofc bro but you telling me you do not code for a living
 KiL3:&#160;???
 KiL3: 5DN1LSelf-taught. Not a professional.
 KiL3: not a professional hahha
 KiL3: good one

 KiL3: you have like 27 different language crtfs
 KiL3: xD
 KiL3: you have to know atleast something
 5DN1L: i know just the basics
 KiL3: welll
 KiL3: thatsalot more than 99 percent ofpopulation
 KiL3: ahhaha
 5DN1L: don't take the percentages seriously
 Katespizer: to be honest these certs are too easy
 5DN1L: some buggy calculation there and CG intends to fix it
 KiL3: with those basics you can build up your knowledge fairly easy
 KiL3: what that tells me is that you undestand programming conceptualy
 KiL3: it shouldnt be hard for you to be a proffesional developer
 5DN1L: haha, maybe
 5DN1L: Katespizer well they are not easy to the ones who just start to learn programming
 KiL3: its not about how hard these challenges are, its about understanding how the code woks... thats more than enough... Syntax is easiest part of learning a language
 StraumliPerversion: he's smart.  smart people can do just about anything
 5DN1L: KIL3 yeah you may know syntax but you may not know how to apply it
 5DN1L: how to build up the logic flow required to solve a problem
 KiL3: yep thats what im saying
 5DN1L: Not as smart as you, StraumliPerversion
 Katespizer: 5DN1L yeah i guess i did too much clashes here, but i dont think its good measure for anyone above junior
 KiL3: you celaarly understand programming if you can switch from one to another language like that
 StraumliPerversion: :P
 5DN1L: KIL3 look at the profile of StraumliPerversion
 KiL3: can i say fuck me here ahhahahah

 KiL3: is that him
 KiL3: Straumi
 KiL3: straumli
 5DN1L: Katespizer I think CG uses the more difficult tests for commercial use, so the public tests are easier
 Katespizer: ohh, that would be interesting to see, when i did cert i got 4 easy problems below 30 seconds, and one very hard
 Katespizer: not that hard, but i believe it most juniors wouldnt be able to complete it 
 KiL3: do you have some example of commercial test?
 5DN1L: I don't
 5DN1L: it'll be through some recruitment agents/employers to take those CG tests
 KiL3: did anyone ever got a job here?
 KiL3: i mean its not that im looking for one
 KiL3: but just  curious
 5DN1L: Not sure, but sometimes saw people say they're going to take the tests here for their job applications
 bsail: Hey all
 Aliyavuz: helloo
 Pms: hey
 Thorcode: :taco: StraumliPerversion
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry Thorcode but you can only award tacos once per day
 Thorcode: nooooooooooooooo
 Thorcode: dammnn me
 MrZee: I think the main point of the certs isn't how hard or easy the challenges are, but the time limit 
 Katespizer: i was able to do it very easily, but i did like 1k clash of code problems
 5DN1L: Well the certs should not make claims in terms of comparison with others (better than &gt;99%). I think the certs should just claim that one has achieved a certain level of programming knowledge/skills
 Katespizer: so im not good measure at all
 Katespizer: i would say platform look promising, cause if you want to hire people, you can see exactly how they approach the problem 
 5DN1L: yeah, for a small sample of job applicants, it's fine

 C26_1: Does everyone here know about the Prime Fuel Puzzle
 C26_1: Statement: Starting at the point 2 (The first prime)
 C26_1: You have n liters of fuels
 C26_1: Each tim the car go right 1 unit, it uses 1 liters of fuels
 C26_1: time*
 C26_1: Everytime the car hits the prime position (i.e. 2,3,5,7,...), then the car has a bonus of prime liters of fuels
 C26_1: Question: Will the car ever stop?Or does it stop eventually
 C26_1: sr if some words ar missing, my omputr is lagg at th ky "e", "d" and "c"
 5DN1L: Don't copy and paste the full statement here
 5DN1L: Just the link is enough
 C26_1: Wait what
 C26_1: I have never copy anything tho
 C26_1: Ok

 C26_1: That's the thing I want to say
 C26_1: The problem: Starting at 2, with 2 litres of fuel, travel along the number line, using 1 litre of fuel per unit travelled. As you pass each prime p, collect p litres of fuel. How far can you go?
 derjack: is this some 3n+1 problem?
 C26_1: Nope
 C26_1: The 3n+1 problem is much harder
 C26_1: 3n+1 problem:Given any number, if it's even then divide by 2. Else, take it times 3 then plus 1. Repeat the process until 1

 AdemDj12: is programming robots same as programming bots&#160;?
 AdemDj12:  i mean physical robots
 AdemDj12: not caring about drivers and stuff
 TimberStalker: I mean. You're taking in data in order to perform actions. The data you take in and actions you perform are obviously different, but its the same concept.
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: Hello, have anyone solved SHADOWS OF THE KNIGHT - EPISODE 1 in JS?
 5DN1L: Yeah, I'm sure there are some who have
 TimberStalker: I can do it real quick right now if you want.
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: I have done it in C# and im trying to do it in JS and its not working&#160;:")
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: idk why tho its should have the same outputs
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: its really bugging me... 
 5DN1L: you can compare the values of the variables during the execution of your two codes
 5DN1L: easier for you to identify which lines go wrong
 DaNinja: make sure you get an integer instead of a float when you divide by two
 TimberStalker: i was just about to say that
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: i did a Math.round which gives me an int eventually but still not working
 Katespizer: try math floor maybe?
 struct: You created your own round?
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: same
 struct: or Math.Round is not working?
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: nah its rounding up but the test is not passing
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: can i put my code here or its against policy or something?
 DaNinja: try (min+max)&gt;&gt;1
 TimberStalker: when you use math.Round, it rounds up sometimes. You need to use Math.Floor
 vinnie_rinella: in the tictactoe one how do i make it skip a move if it cant make it
 struct: you can always make a move
 vinnie_rinella: i mean if the space is taken 
 vinnie_rinella: it stops the program
 struct: well you cant play on an occupied cell
 TimberStalker: Then you move somewhere else?
 vinnie_rinella: but how do i tell it to do that because as soon as it gets there it just stops
 vinnie_rinella: for example if i try to play 1 1 as x but it is taken by o then the program breakes
 vinnie_rinella: and i get this error
 vinnie_rinella: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 TimberStalker: That is a different issue
 vinnie_rinella: ok
 struct: you are given the opponent last action
 struct: you need to keep track of the board state
 vinnie_rinella: ok

 TimberStalker: @HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae Is the issue that the batman gets stuck in  place?
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: DaNinja like logging the the answer is already working.. it already passed first test
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: @TimberStalker No he is just too slow
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: like he doesnt reach bomb before time ends
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: he is one step before getting to the bomb and then times end
 TimberStalker: The algorithm you are using is incredibly ineficient
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: the thing is i used the exact same algorithm for C# and it passed so idk whats the problem here
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: can u tell me how you would do it plz?
 TimberStalker: I just kept track of the min and max bounds of the x and y and went to the middle
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: i dont understand
 Wontonimo: different languages round differently
 Wontonimo: for example, in python the default rounding is "bankers" rounding.
 Wontonimo: .5 rounds to the nearest even number.  2.5 -&gt; 2,   3.5 -&gt; 4
 Wontonimo: so when calculating the "middle" HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae you may experience different rounding in a different lang
 HeroicKittenOfDeath_38ae: I tried everything.. still nothing working
 5DN1L: Did you try comparing your two codes?
 5DN1L: compare how variables change during their execution
 5DN1L: see where the differences arise

 AdemDj12: there is a desktop editor&#160;??

 PluckyPenguin: I think i know the answer to this already but if I have a program that uses multiple classes, can I add them as separate "files" or is it a case of wack it all in 1?
 ninjadip: you mean like header files
 ninjadip:&#160;?
 ninjadip: good question, but i don't think you can do that here. but i'm not sure, never tried, don't know where you would set that up
 PluckyPenguin: Yea kinda like that. I'm doing a hard task in PHP and i'm going 2 need to use classes to make it easier to manage the data. I'll just write it in my IDE and copy &amp; paste everything. Thanks&#160;:)
 vinnie_rinella: how do i make 2 equasions in one if statment in javascript
 ninjadip: you mean like a logical AND&#160;?

 ninjadip: yes if this and this do that
 ninjadip:&#160;?
 PluckyPenguin: if( (test 1) &amp;&amp; (test2) ) { }
 vinnie_rinella: ok thx
 ninjadip: that's what i said, logical And, depending on language

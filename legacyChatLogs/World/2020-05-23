 jacek: happy Caturday
 cegprakash: Saelyos
 cegprakash: how does Saelyos GA's on opponent :o
 cegprakash: isn't nested GA too slow?
 abt8601: On the coordination system, I remember seeing somewhere in the contribution guideline writes that this is a convention is CodinGame.
 abt8601: *in
 CyberLemonade: It's a convention usually in graphics too
 CyberLemonade: 0,0 is top left
 Csipcsirip: stupid convention tho imo
 Csipcsirip: confuses every beginnners
 eulerscheZahl: for me that coord system feels natural
 eulerscheZahl: i guess because i saw it so often before CG
 Csipcsirip: yeah same
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7d822d69-82bb-46b2-a643-0544656822d5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7d822d69-82bb-46b2-a643-0544656822d5</a>
 cegprakash: does ur PacMan collision code similar to mine eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: also what do u think about <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Saelyos/Spring-Challenge-2020">https://github.com/Saelyos/Spring-Challenge-2020</a>
 cegprakash: he mentioned he used GA vs GA vs GA vs GA ...
 cegprakash: isn't that too slow?
 cegprakash: I mean it can work if he has a depth of 1 at each GA
 cegprakash: but I wonder what depth he finally achieved with this strat
 cegprakash: I think what he does israndom vs enemy GA vs his GA vs enemy GA vs his GA (finally maximize this score)
 cegprakash: which can be really good against greedy bots
 Asscannon: parsing
 Ryao: hi
 TheFlyingStopwatchAndHisDog_b771: hi
 Ryao: i am knew to this chat
 BenWo: hello
 TheFlyingStopwatchAndHisDog_b771: same&#160;:)
 Ryao: so i am not so lonely
 BenWo: yeah better to chat occasionally
 BenWo: also good for wasting time :p
 Doju: Heya 
 Doju: BenWo whats up
 Csipcsirip: this new integrated ide is better than most ide in linux
 BenWo: heya Doju
 BenWo: not too much
 BenWo: hopping between puzzles here&#160;:)
 BenWo: how 'bout you?
 Doju: alright
 Doju: uhh, just procrastinating on doing important stuff :P
 Doju: the usual
 BenWo: heh, indeed&#160;:)
 fangskills: anybody know how to solve the Only Negative test case in the temperatures puzzle
 BenWo: don't recall 
 BenWo: can you give the jist of it?
 fangskills: "Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5)."
 fangskills: Everything else works, its just the "Only Numbers" test case
 BenWo: compare absolute values
 Marchete: sort data by abs(value), then by positive/negative
 fangskills: like this?     negativeTemps.sort((a, b) =&gt; Math.abs(b) - Math.abs(a))
 Marchete: I think not
 Marchete: sort must be at the same time
 Marchete: like first sort by abs(value) and if they are the same then by positive/negative
 fangskills: Math.abs(negativeTemps.sort((a, b) =&gt; b - a))
 Marchete: maybe abs(x-0.1) or something similar, I can't recall
 Marchete: the thing is that positive numbers must be sorted in first place
 Marchete: or sort by (abs(x),-x) is python allows it
 fangskills: i didn't write a if function lol im so stupid
 jacek: :o
 Marchete: :anguished:
 eulerscheZahl: :confused:
 The_Anonymous: :no_mouth:
 JBM: :mask:

 kovi: bugged?
 DaNinja: yep, it was working better 30 minutes ago
 kovi: illedan fixed it wrongly. should consider order
 kovi: when touching multiple cps in the same turn
 Marchete: rushed optim....
 DaNinja: yes, I noticed that on cp 0 and 1
 kovi: yeah, i meant turn36
 kovi: hmm, actually my current solver also relies on that bug :o
 kovi: (unknowingly)
 pb4: Doesn't the engine require the the center of the pod touches the CP&#160;?
 kovi: it doesbut probably checks each cp separately
 DaNinja: yes, but the car can cross two cps in one turn, and they dont have to be in the right order
 kovi: not comparing time of touch
 pb4: ohhhhhh
 pb4: I see how it could be implemented wrong&#160;:)
 kovi: sure, i have the similar bug (my code went wrong yesterday)
 kovi: hmm, i got an interesting insighteven improved my csb bot
 kovi: (not seriously as per 2^n, but still)
 amol: Does anyone know how to crack the game: There is no Spooni did not even get what exactly is expected
 H.S.H: hello how can i make 1110 to 1,1,1,0&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: @H.S.H You will have to be more precise with that question
 H.S.H: its will take me a nuber phone and i need to havethem 1 by 1 to translate it
 H.S.H: like 0913254 to (0,9,1,2,...)
 H.S.H: than use dict an tanslate it to morce
 NapTown: covert to string then iterate over characters
 H.S.H: th
 reCurse: A night of training and -5 improvement... I think I'm done.
 eulerscheZahl: nice job
 eulerscheZahl: do you have the checkpoint order bug included?
 reCurse: No
 Mimino_Cj: hi
 reCurse: Probably doesn't matter and will get fixed
 reCurse: Alright it's moving time
 reCurse: Bye
 Astrobytes: Good luck and enjoy!
 bunzkaur: interesting!!
 jrke: hey guys trying fantastic bits how to prevent from bludgers
 WINWINWIN: jrke obliviate
 eulerscheZahl: most useless spell of the game
 CyberLemonade: is creating a class containing 1 integer equally fast as just having an integer
 CyberLemonade: meaning: class Test{int value} object vs int value
 Csipcsirip: if you use c# class will be probably sower because it will be created on the heap and you will access it by reference
 CyberLemonade: hmmmm
 CyberLemonade: thanks
 struct: What do you think?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/NV1MSs3.png">https://i.imgur.com/NV1MSs3.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: now it looks like the original&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: gooooooooooood struct
 Astrobytes: hell yeah struct, much better
 Snef: noice
 struct: thanks
 Snef: did you tried the black circle without white border&#160;?
 struct: Ill do a few more touches to UI then Ill finish statemnt
 struct: yeah, I think it looks better without white border
 struct: But I left it on the pic :p
 Snef: ok cool
 Snef: seems perfect then
 struct: without white border on stones
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/ERMTF4P.png">https://i.imgur.com/ERMTF4P.png</a>
 struct: Snef do you also mean no white border on rings?
 struct: Or its fine on rings?
 Snef: i'd say remove on ring too
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/jV0f8s2.png">https://i.imgur.com/jV0f8s2.png</a>
 Snef: mmmmh
 struct: I think border on ring looks better
 Snef: well the problem is that with black border they are much thicker
 struct: they look more thick
 struct: They are the same thickness
 struct: but with white it doesnt look as thick
 Snef: could you try without any border&#160;?
 struct: Sure
 Snef: i mean is it possible just on black circle&#160;?
 struct: to remove the border just on black?
 Snef: yea
 struct: yeah
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/xoNYyHI.png">https://i.imgur.com/xoNYyHI.png</a>
 struct: Might be good like this
 Snef: yeap but maybe others won't agree  idk :p
 darkhorse64: Sorry if someone already posted about it on the chat but there is a bug in Search Race referee: while accounting for multiple checkpoint intersections, it ignores their order. In Hold the line, when the car returns, it moves frequently on CP 1 then 0, it counts as if it moves over 0 then 1. CP is then turned on
 darkhorse64: CP 2
 Snef: I'm pretty sure it has already been posted
 Snef: not sure if Illedan saw it tho
 darkhorse64: Ah yes a few hours ago. Dunno if is related to latest changes but my bot is now unable to reach 100%. I get the test s right but one or two validators fail
 Snef: sames validator each time&#160;?
 darkhorse64: No, but GA is not deterministic
 Snef: i have that too
 Snef: i have to do like 5 submit to get 100%
 darkhorse64: I try to avoid captchas or worse being locked so I have tried to analyse my sim. That's how I found the pb.
 darkhorse64: Gotta  go
 eulerscheZahl: regarding Search Race:IlledanToday at 5:21 PMI will fix it in a few hours when I get back home.
 Alshock: I'm curious though, how can that bug be a  disadvantage to you darkhorse64? If it's not an idustrial secret ofc
 Alshock: from my naive point of view, it's a little bonus at worse
 Alshock: -e+t
 Snef: if you reuse your last turn solution for seed you will not optimize as fast i guess
 Alshock: oh yeah, if you notice your paths are out of date and start again from scratch then yeah it can hurt
 WINWINWIN: Hi,
 WINWINWIN: I have this statement in python3
 WINWINWIN: if (color_a in rotated_grid[i]) == True:
 WINWINWIN: and even though the color is very clearly in the array
 WINWINWIN: 2 ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '2', '2']
 WINWINWIN: (From Stderr)
 WINWINWIN: itt returns False why?
 Counterbalance: int vs string?
 WINWINWIN: No, checked that
 WINWINWIN: I printed the type of color_a to stderr as well
 WINWINWIN: it was &lt;class, st&gt;
 WINWINWIN: str
 Aesop: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2c21e622-0f0f-4b2c-ab7c-871503954e39">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2c21e622-0f0f-4b2c-ab7c-871503954e39</a>
 Aesop: DEFIB is a string, by the way
 Aesop: Thankful for any help I can get
 Counterbalance: j = DEFIB.length is an assignment
 Aesop: ah shit
 Aesop: ==
 Aesop:&#160;:)
 Aesop: thanks buddy
 Counterbalance: j &lt;
 Aesop: gotcha
 Counterbalance: WINWINWIN maybe the problem is elsewhere? I tested this script in python3 and it works as expected:
 Counterbalance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f15dbc2-74ac-4d1f-a089-93b6ba3df351">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f15dbc2-74ac-4d1f-a089-93b6ba3df351</a>
 Counterbalance: (i'm a python noob though)
 WINWINWIN: Hmm Counterbalance,
 WINWINWIN: (b in a)
 WINWINWIN: I did not use the brackets
 WINWINWIN: is that important?
 Counterbalance: I think you can get away withif color_a in rotated_grid[i]
 anid: WINWINWIN, I don't know why your error is happening, so better if you write your own contains() method
 anid: Just do it via for loop and you should not be able to go wrong, it will not have any performance impact
 WINWINWIN: Will try that ty anid
 pb4: "Snef 17H14I'm pretty sure it has already been postednot sure if Illedan saw it tho"
 pb4: he knows
 struct: Might need to change some things, due to the making player 2 black
 WINWINWIN: contains method doesnt work as well
 WINWINWIN: def contains(arr, elmt): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d06c997-e282-4568-9a12-ef58283bb51d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d06c997-e282-4568-9a12-ef58283bb51d</a>
 WINWINWIN: Is this a correct implementation of checking whether there the element is there in py3?
 eulerscheZahl: if element in collection: ...
 WINWINWIN: Tried that, it didnt work either
 WINWINWIN: no idea wth is wrong with it
 MoMaT: can you paste in a bit of your exact code?
 MoMaT: it is really x in why that you need.
 MoMaT: * "x in y"
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/21990f52-6184-4c39-8c67-08a3e7f10b89">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/21990f52-6184-4c39-8c67-08a3e7f10b89</a>
 WINWINWIN: This is where I use the contains metod
 Counterbalance: ahh
 Counterbalance: you did if (color_a in rotated_grid[i])
 Counterbalance: you should lose the [i], I think
 WINWINWIN: But it is a 2D array
 WINWINWIN: rotated_grid[i] is that specific column
 Counterbalance: hm ok.. weird then!
 WINWINWIN: Completely confused, no idea wtf is going on
 MoMaT: you only need "if color_a in rotated_grid[i]:" as a test.
 MoMaT: you might be storing different types that looks the same when you print.
 WINWINWIN: but I compare str(i) == str(elmt)
 WINWINWIN: so types will be irrelevant
 MoMaT: perhaps try "print(repr(color_a), repr(rotated_grid[i]))"
 WINWINWIN: repr?
 MoMaT: yes, for "representation".
 darkhorse64: Alshock: not sure if recent changes are the cause of my bot's woes, although I can't help noticing than of Hold the line, it has a hard time finding a path when returning. Still, the game does not work as expected and I thought it was a good thing to report. Once it is fixed, I'll be sure the problem is between the chair and the keyboard
 darkhorse64: *that on*
 WINWINWIN: '3' ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '3', '3', '2', '2']
 WINWINWIN: this is the result of the repr print line
 Alshock: Oh ok, I thought your bot suddenly got worse and by investigating it you found that bug
 WINWINWIN: but still got false
 Alshock: @WINWINWIN wait wait wait
 Alshock: @WINWINWIN your colour is a number, but your list contains strings
 WINWINWIN: No but I am comparing str(i) == str(elmt)
 MoMaT: this works. there must be something else going on there.
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:(
 Alshock: Nvm I said that looking back in the history of the chat, but your last post says otherwise
 MoMaT: maybe try: if str(color_a) in rotated_grid[i]
 WINWINWIN: will try that now
 Alshock: or `if any(str(c) == str(color_a) for c in rotated_grid[i]):`
 WINWINWIN: in did not work either
 WINWINWIN: will try any now
 Alshock: the problem is probably elsewhere
 WINWINWIN: None of them are working, code is anyway only like 30 lines, will do a full rewrite
 MoMaT: my guess would be that you change color_a after the first match. try printing it together with thr grid.
 WINWINWIN: Am doing a rewrite probably some unknown error
 MoMaT: there is no such thing&#160;:)
 Alshock: The question is: how do you know for sure that you don't match?
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 Alshock: MoMaT of course there is: unknown to WINWINWIN at least, and for now unknown to us as well
 WINWINWIN: ty for ur help MoMaT
 MoMaT: I meant, there's a bug to be found, not an error in python...
 Alshock: who knows? Maybe it's a bug of the python interpreter, with an odd of 0.0000001
 MoMaT: yeah, but you answered yourself how likely it is...
 Daher: python is a joke
 Alshock: yes it's completely neglictable, but no one claimed that's what's happening :P
 WINWINWIN: Yeah I like C# better, but Im just starting Smash the Code I began with python3
 Alshock: @Daher and Java is a bad joke
 Alshock: C++ is a drunk racist uncle
 Alshock: and C# is an unsustainable I-know-all
 Alshock: dunno how that last one translates to proper english
 WINWINWIN: :D
 WINWINWIN: Rust ftw
 Alshock: if you need to choose between Rust and brainfuck, by all means pick brainfuck?
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:/
 Alshock: why? Cause I just decided I'd trash all languages, yours won't be any exception ok?!?
 struct: MSmits here by any chance?
 Alshock: NullPointerException... OK Java you might be an exception
 WINWINWIN: AGAIN!!!! -_-
 WINWINWIN: damn annoying, will try it out in ruby
 Alshock: participants says no, but idk if it only counts people who posted or all online people
 Alshock: @WINWINWIN do you mind pasting all the part of the code that leads ot that error?
 AntiSquid: if brainfuck was on CG and it gave stupidly huge advantage compared to any other language, i would pick brainfuck
 AntiSquid: so yeah do pick rust
 Alshock: BTW Ruby is life, Ruby is love
 AntiSquid: "ruby users are the children of sata" - a clasher who codes in python
 Alshock: @AntiSquid No, if that was the case, you would use a transpiler just like that of Cotr
 jacek: struct 3 2 is best opening move in Yavalath
 jacek: now lets wait for Him
 struct: ty
 WINWINWIN: Alshock already pasted that code in there
 WINWINWIN: now switching to C# and praying it works
 ArianPunk: hard puzzles doesn't make sense.
 eulerscheZahl: so the puzzle is wrong? and not you?
 Quidome: he euler, question on Bender 4
 Astrobytes: Obviously a bugged puzzle. 
 ArianPunk: true. not me.
 Quidome: I solved the thing, i heard the testcases on submit are available
 Quidome: What is the nature of the puzzl, are you allowed to solve it offline and hardcode the results?
 Quidome: Or only use the available time on the server?
 struct: euler why does this happen?
 struct: java.lang.RuntimeException: Error reading Referee command. Buffer capacity: 32756 / 100000
 struct: It only happens sometimes, on same seed
 struct: Like 1 / 20 times
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen that before
 eulerscheZahl: might be that you create too much data for a single turn?
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't see what could be that expensive
 struct: I guess, but is strange that it shows a lopwer number
 eulerscheZahl: there are 2 size limits per turn
 eulerscheZahl: 100k on first turn
 eulerscheZahl: 30k for later turns
 eulerscheZahl: json size in the replay that is
 eulerscheZahl: Quidome you are allowed to solve offline and hardcode
 eulerscheZahl: personally my solution is found online
 struct: I see, but seems strange it only happens sometimes
 struct: on same map and play
 struct: So game is =
 eulerscheZahl: that's really weird
 Quidome: eulerscheZahl ok, thnxs, that makes it a little bit easier :D
 struct: Ill try to reproduce, ill also export, if it happens again ill send it to CG
 fangskills: in Coders Strike Back, why does my AI output X and Y distance and then it output X and Y as NaN
 struct: fangskills what do you mean?

 Snef: gig you just changed league fangskills&#160;?
 Snef: did*
 fangskills: to Wood 2 League
 fangskills: Nevermind i figured it out lol i always keep forgetting my if statements
 Counterbalance: struct do you get that on the CG servers? I got it locally, figured it was a windows I/O thing. Didn't happen on the first turn, and the mirrored version of the game had 115kb on that frame (and worked fine). 
 struct: yeah locally
 WINWINWIN: Got my Smash the Code working in C#, is basic code enough to get out of Wood2?
 struct: WINWINWIN to get to bronze all you need is to play a legal move
 WINWINWIN: Trying that
 cegprakash: will stream oware abapa minimax after having dinner
 WINWINWIN: Still only #2 in Wood2
 WINWINWIN: @cegprakash 11:20 dinner?
 WINWINWIN: Man
 cegprakash: it's supposed to be my breakfast
 cegprakash: I just woke up
 WINWINWIN: :D
 cegprakash: GA can work amazing on Smash the code
 cegprakash: or even a recursion will do
 cegprakash: without considering enemy
 cegprakash: it's afterall 6^8 possibilities
 WINWINWIN: Yes
 Snef: isn't it 11^8&#160;?
 Snef: with rotation
 struct: 22^8
 cegprakash: I didn't include rotation
 Snef: right
 cegprakash: :o
 cegprakash: why 22?
 Snef: 6+6+5+5
 Snef: 6 when they are in "I" shape
 Snef: 5 when they are in "_" shape
 cegprakash: oh there are L, T shapes in higher leagues?
 struct: No
 Snef: no
 struct: ceg
 Snef: vertical horizontal
 struct: Pieces can have 2 colors
 ZarthaxX: 6^8 is pretty horrible already tho
 eulerscheZahl: "GA can work amazing on Smash the code"I don't see how GA should be awesome here
 struct: if it was 6^8 you preety much could simulate all
 cegprakash: 6^8 runs in 1 ms in my computer
 struct: Sure
 struct: go sim smash the code 
 ZarthaxX: right
 ZarthaxX: :P
 struct: 1.5mill sims in 1ms
 struct: Do you have nano computer?
 ZarthaxX: he has the quantum

 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/rORadz">https://ideone.com/rORadz</a>
 eulerscheZahl: there is no D only contest
 eulerscheZahl: kotlin heroes on may 29th
 ZarthaxX: what with that cegprakash?
 MostComplicatedUsername: I just realized I missed a whole contest
 cegprakash: 0 secs
 struct: lol
 struct: dont troll
 struct: please
 ZarthaxX: ceg that's not a way of testing
 ZarthaxX: and you know it
 cegprakash: well u need a sim with O(1)
 ZarthaxX: funny
 eulerscheZahl: i have
 eulerscheZahl: but higher constant
 cegprakash: see..
 cegprakash: it's possible
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl has done it
 ZarthaxX: i will just stop talking
 struct: I will pay you
 struct: if you get 1.5mill sims
 struct: in 1 ms
 struct: with depth 8
 eulerscheZahl: when we define everything as constant (taking the upper limit, e.g. board size), it is constant
 cegprakash: go watch my stream for pallankuzhi I was getting easily million sims at depth 10
 ZarthaxX: well said toad
 cegprakash: I streamed today morning
 struct: pallankuzhi is not STC
 cegprakash: it's still 6^depth
 struct: STC is not 6^depth
 struct: its  22^depth
 cegprakash: Oware Abapa
 struct: and you need to floodfill
 Snef: and one turn cost way more
 struct: You need to drop pieces
 cegprakash: I see 24^depth struct
 cegprakash: how 22?
 Snef: just think lel
 struct: ^
 eulerscheZahl: scroll up
 eulerscheZahl: there's an explanation for 22
 cegprakash: I don't get it.. we have 4 possible rotations * 6 positions to place
 cegprakash: that's 24
 Snef: look the rotation
 Snef: for all of them you have 6 places&#160;?
 struct: Should I keep both?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/fp3AiTW.png">https://i.imgur.com/fp3AiTW.png</a>
 struct: Currently is optional, viewer can choose
 cegprakash: oh yes we can't keep it outisde board
 cegprakash: gotcha
 struct: viewer* player
 eulerscheZahl: both sounds good
 eulerscheZahl: you already coded both
 struct: yeah
 struct: Now im gonna add mouse over, to display coordinates
 eulerscheZahl: then players will share screenshots and we will be confused that it looks completely different :D
 struct: I have coordinates optional for hex board
 struct: but I cant find a good color for it
 struct: Due to black pieces
 struct: I add black text before
 ArianPunk: whos done The Bridge puzzle?
 MostComplicatedUsername: euler im above you in td&#160;:)
 MostComplicatedUsername: Why does my code look different?
 MostComplicatedUsername: It looks like keywords are in different colors
 Astrobytes: They changed the IDE from ACE to Monaco MCU
 MostComplicatedUsername: oh
 Astrobytes: struct, that Yinsh board with the original design is sooo much better. Great job.
 struct: Thanks, stil giving some finishing touches
 jrke: hey i wanna know how to predict enemy pod in csb for attacking i am using x+vx and y+vy is this ok 
 MostComplicatedUsername: My rank fell 900 places in the few months that I wasn't on
 MostComplicatedUsername: jrke that only predicts one turn ahead though
 ArianPunk: have u encountered buggy puzzles?
 struct: jrke check csb magu s guide
 Astrobytes: ^
 eulerscheZahl: congrats MostComplicatedUsername
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;:)
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Fix what
 Astrobytes: Your rank&#160;:)
 struct: I have a hard decision, should I add the coordinates or not, they are optional on viewer, you can choose if you see them or not
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/VOIWI66.png">https://i.imgur.com/VOIWI66.png</a>
 struct: Also the color, which one?
 eulerscheZahl: that looks like a mess
 struct: Yeah&#160;:(
 struct: I guess ill remove this optioin
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: That font is shit
 MostComplicatedUsername: I'm 6th place! That's good!
 struct: Give me a font
 struct: :D
 Astrobytes: What do I look like, a designer? :P
 eulerscheZahl: a ca
 eulerscheZahl: cat
 Astrobytes: A font with no outline will be better, for starters
 Astrobytes: Thank you toad
 struct: I need outline because of white pieces
 struct: or I can change the color of text
 Astrobytes: black font on white, white font on black
 struct: hmm, a bit messy to code now
 Astrobytes: Also, perhaps a sans-serif font would be more readable?
 struct: Ill just remove
 struct: :p
 struct: or leave it, its optional
 struct: you can just disable
 struct: someone might like it
 eulerscheZahl: options are always good
 jacek: comic sans
 Astrobytes: No one will like it in the current state :P
 Snef: jacek =&gt; []
 Astrobytes: YES Jacek has the answer
 eulerscheZahl: that font might be what gets you towards the 30k limit
 eulerscheZahl: lengthy name used many times i json
 eulerscheZahl: in json
 eulerscheZahl: for CGFunge i show one line after another not to exceed the per-frame limit
 struct: Arial looks good
 struct: might be euler
 struct: but for me its strange that it happens only sometimes
 struct: It is not happening for a while though
 struct: so I  guess im safe
 AntiSquid: hey the new design looks good
 struct: Thanks
 AntiSquid: maybe even the right one (grey colored board) could work with different background color
 Astrobytes: struct, also try Verdana
 AntiSquid: use an Apple font
 struct: Soon I have too remake yinsh
 struct: and it will be become customizable viewer
 Illedan: Why? Did you fail?
 AntiSquid: Myriad, Lucida Grande and Helvetica Neueor even Avenir
 AntiSquid: Jobs sat in on Palladino's calligraphy class at Portland's Reed College, which eventually inspired the elegance for which Apple computers are renowned, the tech icon recalled in his famous 2005 commencement address at Stanford University. "It was the first computer with beautiful typography," 
 Astrobytes: Come on, Arial and Helvetica Neue are practically interchangeable
 AntiSquid: that's why you're not a world renowned businessman Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Or dead.
 AntiSquid: he died of cancer, are you saying the font gave him cancer?
 Astrobytes: I'm no oncologist...
 Astrobytes: Speaking of medical things, I have to go for a brain and spine MRI in a couple of weeks.
 struct: why brain?
 Astrobytes: It's attached to my spine&#160;;)
 JBM: fix it
 Snef: he has only 16 404 at search race
 Snef: that's why
 Astrobytes: lol shuddup snef :D
 Snef: :D
 AntiSquid: "only"&#160;? hard to tell what's a good score
 AntiSquid: is the game released?
 struct: y
 Snef: yes
 Astrobytes: 10,641.950 is a good score
 Snef: well i think that without a search sub 15000 is good
 Snef: and with a search sub 11k is good
 Astrobytes: Yeah I have no search yet
 AntiSquid: since today or what
 Snef: hmm 2 day i think
 Astrobytes: Was either this morning or last night, not 100% sure
 AntiSquid: no cover pic
 AntiSquid: also many community multis have no cover
 AntiSquid: should be made mandatory
 JBM: i agree
 AntiSquid: even the avatarless guy agrees
 JBM: like I'm the only one
 Astrobytes: They don't call JBM Jean-Baptiste the Mysterious for no reason you know
 eulerscheZahl: stop doxxing
 JBM: that's a pseudo for hiding my real "java bad mystery" id
 Astrobytes: We already established that it's J'aime. Bof. Merde eulerscheZahl
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) any point going for #1 in multi`s like search race? reCurse always dominates with his NN
 Astrobytes: Of course. See how far you can get
 AntiSquid: Jack Beanstalk  the Mysterious 
 Snef: go for #2 WINWINWIN
 Astrobytes: *Jacques
 eulerscheZahl: search race is not a multi
 JBM: i'm really going to have to open a wiki for this topic
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: Just to think I still have to write statement&#160;:/
 JBM: i've already forgotten what my new favorite was
 JBM: statements are overrated
 struct: JBM can you do it?
 AntiSquid: WINWINWIN yes ofc, bragging rights and you get to annoy the guy you dropped, bonus points if it's someone like recurz
 eulerscheZahl: saw beanstalk only in context of AWS so far. not even sure if i should pronounce it bean-stalk or beans-talk
 Astrobytes: It'll end up like the Ubuntu dev code names that euler posted the other day
 WINWINWIN: :D
 JBM: you'd pronounce both differently?
 Astrobytes: The former euler
 eulerscheZahl: so like secretly observing beams. creepy
 Astrobytes: *beans
 eulerscheZahl: right, type
 eulerscheZahl: typo
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: was reference to "Jack and the Beanstalk" btw, just in case AutomatonNN missed it
 AutomatonNN: you still have a lose and no one does
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/performances/184883">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/performances/184883</a>that's some serious misunterstanding of how CG works
 eulerscheZahl: oh, now i got the name. thanks AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: Just a bit.
 JBM: or just next-level trolling
 Astrobytes: Notice, eulerscheZahl, that's it's not Jack and the Beans Talk. That would be a show about Jack and some Mexicans presumably.
 JBM: whereas Jack and the Bean stalk is a PI agency name?
 Astrobytes: ofc, Jack Haricot, P.I
 JBM: Jacques
 JBM: please
 Astrobytes: Yes, I realised my mistake and waited for the correction
 JBM: that's what i'm here for
 Astrobytes: I'm immensely grateful
 AntiSquid: he should reply with "So when i a CG server update to be expected?"
 AntiSquid: is *
 Aesop: why does it have to be so damn hard to find a minimum value's index in a List in C#? I just can't figure it out.
 Aesop: Scourged the net for answers and it's all about writing your own damn methods, why isn't this standardized?
 kovi: nice neumann
 Neumann: thks
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16684769/get-minimum-and-maximum-value-using-linq">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16684769/get-minimum-and-maximum-value-using-linq</a>
 AntiSquid: Aesop
 Illedan: Neumann \o/
 Astrobytes: Oof great score Neumann, grats
 Aesop: Thanks AntiSquid, just figured it out
 Neumann: Wait for when we'll be able to use full 50ms :P
 Aesop: List.IndexOf(List.Min()) works just fine
 Illedan: ^^
 eulerscheZahl: but that is slower than necessary Aesop
 Aesop: could you please elaborate?
 eulerscheZahl: you iterate twice over the list
 Aesop: does Linq mitigate that slowdown?
 eulerscheZahl: 1st to find the min and then again to find the index
 Aesop: right
 Aesop: gotcha
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know what you are doing. maybe it doesn't even matter in your case
 kovi: +30% time will give no more than a 1-2% with SA
 Aesop: it's a small list, but i'd rather keep it clean and nice from the beginning so as to avoid future mistakes of that kind
 Aesop: never used Linq though so I'll have a closer look at AntiSquid's link
 kovi: (actually only +25% for me, im at 36ms)
 eulerscheZahl: LINQ doesn't have the greatest performance. but it's awesome to express some thoughts in very little code
 darkhorse64: kovi: Shall I infer that I should learn SA for SR
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 kovi: well, actually i dont use real SA either
 eulerscheZahl: read the tags: you need beam search
 AntiSquid: obey
 Illedan: My buggy beam search gets 22k and 90&#160;% :D
 Astrobytes: You need Simulated 'Anhealing'
 eulerscheZahl: Unhealing
 eulerscheZahl: let me unheal you quickly :rifle:
 eulerscheZahl: :pistol:
 eulerscheZahl: really?
 eulerscheZahl: :weapon:
 eulerscheZahl: :gun:
 AntiSquid: how do you decide what to use for speed racer? code them all or what
 eulerscheZahl: :sword:
 eulerscheZahl: come on...
 Astrobytes: 'Simulated Anhealing' is Illedan's secret algo
 Illedan: -3 vel AntiSquid ezpz
 Illedan: fix it
 Astrobytes: :knife: eulerscheZahl
 AntiSquid: i mean how to decide which meta heuristic to use
 eulerscheZahl: thanks Astrobytes. was looking for something more powerful
 eulerscheZahl: :car: that will do the job
 AntiSquid: :fist:
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;??
 Astrobytes: In the right hands a knife can be very powerful indeed
 AntiSquid: :truck:
 eulerscheZahl: i can't remember failing that many emojis in a row
 Illedan: :bomb:
 Astrobytes: :bow_and_arrow:
 AntiSquid: :toad:
 AntiSquid: :frog:
 Astrobytes: :squid:
 Astrobytes: :motorcycle:
 AntiSquid: not me
 eulerscheZahl: :musical_score: hurting your ears
 Astrobytes: :no_entry_sign: :motorcycle:
 Astrobytes: Closest I can get AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: :no_entry_sign: :squid:
 AntiSquid: whichever lol
 Astrobytes: Both covered nicely there
 AntiSquid: or i need to chain all 3&#160;?
 Neumann: Beam Search sucks on SR
 eulerscheZahl: but it's tagged
 Neumann: It's a trap
 AntiSquid: but what about SEARCHO NO CHOKUDAI&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: so from my point of view as an outstander not player beam search must be a save bet
 Neumann: Didn't tried Chokudai but I'm guessing it'll suck for the same reasons
 Astrobytes: But Chokudai is the Only Way. Other than the One True AI.
 Illedan: How do you know beam search sucks Neumann? :P
 Neumann: Have I missed some memes about Chodukai&#160;?
 Neumann: Because I tried it Illedan :D Among other things
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: like people tried minimax and saw it fail on CSB? realizing that GA is the best way
 Neumann: haha
 AntiSquid: then why no GA here? why someone mentions SA?
 Neumann: My guess is that every search that uses intermediate evaluations as a way to chose which branch to explore sucks
 Neumann: I might be wrong
 AntiSquid: or solo player smitsi 
 eulerscheZahl: MCTS
 Astrobytes: ^
 RoboStac: I can say that solo player smitsi isn't working very well for me
 Neumann: Solo player Smitsi is called "MCTS"
 Snef: Neumann i think that too
 Illedan: haha robo
 RoboStac: even if it still has 3 other pods that just can't collide and never move in it?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Are you not planning some kind of NN-based solution RoboStac?
 Neumann: Capped-depth MCTS worked "ok" for me
 Illedan: Damn, you have tried a lot already :o
 Astrobytes: How deep Neumann?
 Neumann: MCTS, Hill Climbing, SA, Beam Search
 Neumann: Pick one
 RoboStac: I've not really planned anything Astrobytes, just converted my csb code with as little effort as possible
 Neumann: Astrobytes: not that deep
 Neumann: About half as deep as Snef
 Astrobytes: Simplest way first Robo&#160;;)
 Snef: you got this score with half my depth Neumann&#160;?? or just for your mcts try&#160;?
 Astrobytes: What's your depth Snef?
 Neumann: Both
 Snef: wut 
 Snef: around 20 Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: k
 Alshock: What's the advantage of a capped depth mcts over a mcts with an eval?
 Snef: capped depth mcts do have eval no&#160;?
 Neumann: Yup
 Astrobytes: yes, EPT
 Alshock: which depth is then capped only by its rollouts in the branch
 AntiSquid: leaderboard is sorted in wrong order, i have most points
 Neumann: lol
 Snef: congratz AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: I never thanked you Neumann for introducing me to that concept during Oware
 Neumann: It's not mine
 Astrobytes: No but you mentioned it
 Neumann: What does EPT stands for&#160;?
 Astrobytes: And I didn't know about it previoously
 Astrobytes: EArly playout termination
 Neumann: Ok
 jacek: but you still need eval for it :c
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 Neumann: Astrobytes = Astroshytes&#160;?
 jacek: Astro8bits
 Astrobytes: Yes Neumann, I should probably change it on Discord
 Neumann: Ok, I can stop to wonder that everytime now
 Astrobytes: :D
 MostComplicatedUsername: I feel like Clash of Code doesn't test your knowledge of programming concepts, it tests your knowledge of obscure libraries
 eulerscheZahl: here's another one for you Neumann: i'm an issue = BenjaminUrquhart
 Neumann: I knew that one
 Astrobytes: Doesn't he have another alias too?
 Astrobytes: (changed my discord name to astrobytes btw)
 Astrobytes: creepersbane or something
 YurkovAS: Neumann do you have fails in SR with ttl 45-49ms? don't understand why 2 distinc sim work only with ttl 30-40ms.
 eulerscheZahl: congrats, now you confused those who are mostly active on discord
 Neumann: YurkovAS: Yes, happends to everyone trying to use more than 35-38ms
 Neumann: happens *
 Astrobytes: Meh. I always assumed having the kitten version of my CG avatar was enough anyway
 eulerscheZahl: i even get timeouts with 50ms for a 100ms multiplayer (connect4)
 eulerscheZahl: used to work with 90ms
 YurkovAS: Neumann thanks
 Astrobytes: C# issue eulerscheZahl or general?
 eulerscheZahl: dunno
 eulerscheZahl: i almost exclusively have c# bots
 Astrobytes: true
 struct: I was having this issue to withc++
 Astrobytes: On SR or others too?
 struct: sr
 Astrobytes: Yeah that's happening for all on SR using &gt; x time limit. euler's one is the odd one here
 struct: oh god
 struct: white color was a mistake

 struct: I  uploaded with yavalath stament
 struct: ahahah
 eulerscheZahl: is it a win or a draw?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 struct: same on viewer is hard to tell
 struct: I guess ill leave player colors
 struct: and change it in viewer instead of on config
 Astrobytes: you're up late eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: I'm getting tired alreadt
 MSmits: is the world upside down?
 Astrobytes: Must be&#160;:)How are you MSmits
 Illedan: MSmits, not on SR yet?
 struct: Hello MSmits
 struct: Ive somethig to ask, ill draw it
 MSmits: hi
 MSmits: not on SR no
 MSmits: someone's gotta try and kick karlis o off nr 1 uttt&#160;:)
 MSmits: draw it struct
 Astrobytes: UTTT is almost a way of life for you now eh&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but i am mostly doing it because i can do it on the side, while doing some work. Not much coding 
 Astrobytes: Any of your students playing it?
 MSmits: Dont think so, but I have a student that wants to do his last year project on search algorithms. He will pick a CG game i think
 MSmits: possibly uttt, though it's probably not the best pick
 Astrobytes: The one who participated in the contest?
 MSmits: its better to write a report on a game that makes more sense when you look at a board
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: that one
 Astrobytes: Very true, and awesome. That's really cool
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Seemed a smart kid
 MSmits: yeah he is quite good. He did the labyrinth puzzle without any help
 MSmits: we dont teach at that level really, noone is supposed to be able to solve the labyrinth
 ZarthaxX: i couldnt sovlve it even
 ZarthaxX: what a beast
 Astrobytes: Nice. He's got the interest, that will take him far.
 MSmits: I had a lot of problems with it too ZarthaxX
 MSmits: he did it in python too, i think
 Astrobytes: Hey Zarthachloride
 MSmits: you're going through chemical formulas now?
 Astrobytes: Just whatever comes to mind
 MSmits: I see
 ZarthaxX: i saw it once and left it
 ZarthaxX: then came another day and was easy
 jacek: why dont he do paper soccer then
 ZarthaxX: the fuck Astrobytes LOL
 jacek: :s
 MSmits: you should pose this question more generally jacek
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: why don't people do paper soccer?
 jacek: exactly!
 MSmits: honestly, I dont know, it seems fine
 Astrobytes: Multi-overload
 MSmits: its about as interesting as twixt, it's on my list, but below a few others, not so many
 MSmits: i want to do breakthrough first
 MSmits: yinsh if it comes out probably
 struct: I dont know how I should draw this
 struct: Its a MCTS thingy
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: maybe i understand it from your words
 jacek: breakthrough eh? mcts again eh
 Astrobytes: what about that online graph too lthat euler posted
 MSmits: some form probably yes jacek
 Astrobytes: *tool
 struct: Do you have the link Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: gimme a sec, I might
 struct: In my head this makes sence and it doesnt
 MostComplicatedUsername: lol sence
 struct: I just wanna know if this idea is flawed
 MSmits: is it a superposition of sense and nonsense struct?
 struct: Sorry english is not my mother language
 MSmits: isn't mine either
 MostComplicatedUsername: Me neither

 MSmits: what is&gt;
 MSmits: you're making less sense than usual struct
 Astrobytes: Impossible! :P
 ZarthaxX: he is high
 Astrobytes: On a mountain? :P
 MSmits: of meth
 MostComplicatedUsername: ...
 Astrobytes: lol, I'm rewatching Breaking Bad so I like that reply
 MostComplicatedUsername: Children these days...
 Astrobytes: Maybe if you smoke some DMT struct, it will become clear
 MSmits: watched breaking bad two times. All of it
 struct: You started it 
 struct: Dont come with the child play
 Astrobytes: Great isn't it MSmits
 MSmits: best series ever
 Astrobytes: I concur
 MSmits: I am also watching better call saul. It can't be as good as breaking bad, but it's an unfair comparison. I like it too
 Astrobytes: I was thinking about watching that when I finish this, I've not seen it but it's got a good reputation
 MSmits: it takes a while to get into it, but then again so did breaking bad
 Astrobytes: I can live with that
 MSmits: I remember watching the first 2 episodes or so, right around the bath thing and then quit for months
 JBM: breaking bad took me no time to get into
 MSmits: when i got back i watched all of them in like a week or two
 JBM: that 1st episode was outstanding
 Astrobytes: Did you ever get around to watching Picard MSmits?
 Astrobytes: Yes I was hooked instantly too JBM
 MSmits: yes, but you;ve got to realize the genre is very far from what i normally watch. But breaking bad is just so good, even if it's not your genre you have to see it
 MSmits: Astrobytes i havent seen it no, because of the streaming service
 Astrobytes: Oh just torrent it already :P
 Astrobytes: (I never said that)
 JBM: why not
 MSmits: i'm patient
 MSmits: i will see it for sure
 MSmits: I watched all star trek ever made
 MSmits: most of it multiple times
 Astrobytes: Can't be seen to be advocating smoking DMT and downloading torrents in the same chat stream JBM
 MSmits: wait except the original series btw
 Astrobytes: You will love Picard MSmits
 MSmits: no doubt
 Astrobytes: JBM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0ab970de-ad1c-4b66-bed2-b3363a4097bf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0ab970de-ad1c-4b66-bed2-b3363a4097bf</a>
 JBM: wtf
 Astrobytes: ikr
 JBM: you were left, at least?
 Astrobytes: Left? As in position or alive?
 jacek: so did struct said what he wanted to say?
 JBM: position
 Astrobytes: Right
 JBM: just about nothing in this transcript makes sense
 struct: What do you mean jacek?
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's why I sent it to you JBM&#160;;)
 MSmits: struct PM-ed me jacek
 MSmits: it's fine, no worries
 JBM: could you gather the entire I/O?&#160;:/
 struct: Yes, very secret algorithm
 MSmits: just some mcts questions
 struct: This will make me rank 1 
 MSmits: sorry, ruined the mystery :P
 JBM: i can't deal with it now, but I kind of have to investigate that level of bugginess
 struct: Anyone want to write statement, last chance
 struct: I have good deal
 Astrobytes: Can I just give you the seed JBM?
 JBM: well
 JBM: i'd need seed + bot algs
 MSmits: struct, people can suggest edits as well cant they?
 JBM: oh wait
 struct: suggest edits?
 JBM: can i run both your arena bots?
 struct: of the statement?
 Astrobytes: Yes
 JBM: let's try
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: seed=-3777575510120129500
 struct: Should I take design one of the board or design2 for the statement?
 Astrobytes: And both bots are deterministic it seems
 MSmits: didnt see the pictures struct
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/o1xMaRQ.png">https://i.imgur.com/o1xMaRQ.png</a>
 struct: Both are available, so player can choose
 Astrobytes: Much better font struct
 MSmits: I like the 2nd one. The lines confuse me.
 MSmits: (the lines on the first one)
 struct: Line takes time to get used to it
 Astrobytes: I prefer the lines, I see it as a graph
 struct: But for the statement
 MSmits: mmh ok
 struct: might be easier to see on 2nd
 Astrobytes: *see it more obviously as a graph
 JBM: hey at least the viewer is correct
 JBM: yeah i reproduced
 Astrobytes: Cool
 struct: viewer is correct but referee isnt?
 JBM: viewer is output by ref so...
 JBM: not sure what ref gave the gamemanager as a result
 Astrobytes: The wrong info? (just guessing there)
 JBM: was it in your lastbattles?
 JBM: oh wait i have it too
 JBM: it's the correct viewer + ranking
 JBM: just the game text is wrong it seems
 JBM: well lol
 JBM: gameManager.addToGameSummary(GameManager.formatErrorMessage("Troll destroys " + gameManager.getPlayer(winner).getNicknameToken()));
 JBM: yeah tjhat's kind of obviously wrong
 JBM: thanks for spotting!
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Astrobytes: No worries
 JBM: you'll get nice git commit message credits
 Astrobytes: Yay, fame, at last.
 JBM: uploading...

 Astrobytes: Also, pewpewpew
 JBM: pew
 Zenoscave: pewpew

 struct: you must use true ai
 Zenoscave: eh...
 Zenoscave: how is that enforced
 JBM: with Honor
 Illedan: thx, it is not :P
 Zenoscave: Good to hear! I will try it
 JBM: (I tried that with TvC, it kind of didn't work long)
 Astrobytes: What, the One True AI?
 Astrobytes: Or honour?
 Zenoscave: honour
 JBM: in context, in was honneur
 Zenoscave: I'll try no sim AI
 Zenoscave: does RL count as sim?
 JBM: but no can do, in 5 minutes we had celebrity-account AIs throwing negative amounts of stones
 Astrobytes: "celebrity-account AIs " :D

 Astrobytes: It's all in one file?
 struct: Good idea
 Astrobytes: What? 1 file or splitting it up?
 struct: 1 file
 struct: around 1.2k lines

 MSmits: gonna get some sleep and stuff
 MSmits: gn

 JBM: Zenoscave: welcome to TvC!
 Zenoscave: Thanks!
 JBM: what's your secret?
 Zenoscave: It's pretty simple
 Zenoscave: not gonna share
 Zenoscave: Just watch a few replays. it's obvious
 JBM: you tell me your secret, i give you the boss's alg
 Zenoscave: There's a boss?
 struct: JBM whats your secret to have people play your game without writing a statement?
 Astrobytes: Hand drawn troll
 Alshock: struct wonderful graphics
 Zenoscave: Promotion 
 Zenoscave: and a hand drawn troll
 struct: thanks
 struct: im writing statement Alshock
 struct: dont read that one, that one is from yavalath
 struct: :p
 Zenoscave: JBM who is the boss?
 JBM: struct: how dare you
 JBM: i've got a statement
 Alshock: who read statements anyway?
 Zenoscave: I just shoot one more rock than the opp did last time.
 JBM: it's actually rather long
 JBM: oh, not bad
 Zenoscave: lol
 JBM: the current boss sends random(0,stones)
 JBM: the former boss just sent 1
 Zenoscave: ...
 struct: true ai
 Alshock: it wasn't when we started playing your game so his point is valid
 Alshock: when you told us about that game the statement was 3 lines long
 pb4: including one line complaining that nobody would read it anyway
 Zenoscave: That's great
 struct: statements overrated
 Zenoscave: I think that line should be brought back

 AntiSquid: just saw the fancy new pic
 struct: I shouldnt make my default AI random should I?
 struct: that is bad for players that want to test right?
 Zenoscave: Never make the default random
 Alshock: that depends, is it functional?
 Zenoscave: never!
 struct: ah its not
 struct: int r = new Random(412).nextInt(actionCount)
 Alshock: ideally, give your random a fixed seed
 Alshock: then it's ok
 Alshock: Idk if that's what the 412 does, but if so I'm affraid you have only one number
 struct: yeah its bad
 struct: but actionCount changes depending on turn
 Alshock: you should make randomgenerator only once in your programme
 Alshock: and then call it
 struct: you are right
 AntiSquid: i am 16/32 in the troll game, with D lang, maybe if i add 5 lines i get #1
 AntiSquid: using default code btw
 struct: I have been training NN for that game for 5 days
 struct: but still no t good
 AntiSquid: try different model
 pb4: struct&#160;?
 struct: Sorry I missed /s
 struct: Today is my troll day
 pb4: Thought so
 pb4: though
 Zenoscave: pb4 yw
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article">https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article</a>
 pb4: could apply
 Zenoscave: bumped you to 1st in TvC
 pb4: Nice Zenoscave&#160;:)
 pb4: Thanks&#160;!
 AntiSquid: seriously, with 4 inputs each turn why not try to train a perceptron? :D
 AntiSquid: ok 5 inputs, 1 output
 pb4: You'll notice I didn't add the /s&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I'm attempting an alphabeta type thing in TvC but I fucked it up because it's late and codeine
 Zenoscave: ... perceptrons were used ever?
 AntiSquid: you should get something that performs statistically well
 Alshock: AntiSquid what's the fifth output?
 Alshock: input*
 AntiSquid: simple game, doesn't need much more does it Zenoscave?
 Alshock: I see aStone/aDist/bStones/bDist
 AntiSquid: roadlength 
 Zenoscave: Fair
 Alshock: it's aDist+bDist
 Astrobytes: Since I'm now wasted mentally and in TvC I shall retire to the sofa
 Astrobytes: gn/bn to you all 
 AntiSquid: didn't look properly at the while loop
 AntiSquid: yes 4
 AntiSquid: roadlength, trolldist, stones, opstones
 AntiSquid: bye Astrobytes
 Alshock: would a NN fair better with a fixed roadlength than with the opponentDist&#160;?
 Alshock: fare*
 Alshock: I must admit my total lack of knowledge in that area
 struct: I have no idea too, never tried NN

 AntiSquid: trying to find an article
 Illedan: TvC?
 Zenoscave: the troll game
 AntiSquid: troll vs castle
 fangskills: anybody know how to do the temperatures puzzel 
 fangskills: puzzle *
 struct: use abs()
 struct: absolute value
 struct: |-3| == 3
 struct: you need to find the closest value to 0
 JBM: that solved it
 fangskills: i only need the "Only Negative" test case to be completed
 struct: What are you outputing on that test?
 fangskills: Nothing 
 struct: Share the code
 fangskills: it suppose to console log it but idk why it doesn't do it
 struct: Ill try to see whats wrong
 fangskills: want all of the code?
 struct: yeah
 struct: just paste it here
 fangskills: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f62a5e1d-5884-4ade-bf41-7cbac3d93ec5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f62a5e1d-5884-4ade-bf41-7cbac3d93ec5</a>
 struct: fangskills you want the solution
 struct: or want me to tell you whats wrong?
 fangskills: tell me whats wrong
 struct: So the problem is
 struct: that if positive temps is empty
 fangskills: and give me the solution by giving me the link to the code
 struct: you will never have a if for that
 fangskills: thanks for that hint!
 fangskills: i been using if statements all the time lol

 Alshock: if is love, if is life
 struct: But check other players solutions
 struct: There are better ways to solve this problem
 Alshock: js just returns undefined when you access an out-of-range element I guess?
 struct: yeah Alshock
 struct: at least i think
 struct: Javascript is a mess
 Alshock: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/de283467-0126-4f05-851e-c9ad35e6385f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/de283467-0126-4f05-851e-c9ad35e6385f</a>
 Alshock: undefined &lt; x =&gt; false, so we can slightly rework that
 Alshock: I just realized pasting a working solution in cg chat might not be the most clever move ever
 JBM: BURN
 JBM: wasn't your ban enough?
 Alshock: hey, I realized before actually doing it :P
 Alshock: don't throw stones at me or I'll turn your castle upside down
 JBM: heh
 Illedan: Do you guys want debug lines for SR?Like print some special message and I draw red lines on the canvas for whatever you want to debug?
 Alshock: hummmm, that'd be useful, but only to draw dicks on the screen IMHO
 Illedan: You can still do that with skidmarks..
 Alshock: why do you think so many people play your game?
 Illedan: DaNinja around?
 Illedan: It's not many players yet
 Alshock: We Are Billions!
 struct: Are there sites that make writing html easier?
 Alshock: Sorry I let you ask real questions to real player and I stop that noise xD
 struct: I guess that can save me a bit of time on statement
 Illedan: Any of top 3 on SR around?
 Neumann: Sure
 Neumann: Is the CP "collision" calculated like regular collisions&#160;? Or once per turn only&#160;? My code think he got the CPs but doesn't, sometimes .. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/468778260">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/468778260</a>
 Illedan: It is multiple times per turn
 Illedan: I rewrote the collision part because of DaNinja's bug: Not live yet, but in this Arena for testing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5075a2f7cec5d95972367597b8ae3fe7c79f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5075a2f7cec5d95972367597b8ae3fe7c79f</a>
 Neumann: What was his bug&#160;?
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/468603470">https://www.codingame.com/replay/468603470</a>
 Illedan: Frame 35
 Illedan: I didn't move the car when checking for multiple collisions
 fangskills: On the "Only Negative Numbers" why does it send multiple numbers but expect one negative number
 Alshock: errrr, can you link the puzzle page? ^^
 fangskills: For my question? 
 Illedan: Neumann, I use the same collision check as in Bit Runner
 Alshock: oh ok you're on temperatures
 fangskills: yeah
 struct: you mean on temperatures fangskills?
 fangskills: yes
 struct: If there are multiple negative
 Alshock: well you need to output the temperature closest to 0, there's only one
 struct: only*
 struct: you must output the one closest to 0
 struct: yeah
 fangskills: oh
 fangskills: okay i got it then lol i was confused for a sec
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace/blob/master/SearchRace/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Unit.java#L36">https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace/blob/master/SearchRace/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Unit.java#L36</a>
 Neumann: Yeah I've got the same
 Illedan: Do you truncate positions or round them?
 Neumann: round
 Illedan: They are truncated
 Neumann:  /flip
 struct: :D
 Neumann: Weren't they rounded in CSB/BR&#160;?
 Alshock: ah ah ah
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace/blob/master/SearchRace/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Unit.java#L29-L33">https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace/blob/master/SearchRace/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Unit.java#L29-L33</a>
 struct: yes on CSB at least
 Illedan: CSB = rounder
 Alshock: position is rounded and speed is truncated
 Illedan: BR = truncated
 Alshock: iirc
 Illedan: Else the game wasn't 100% equal
 Zaphus: Does it bug anyone else that in many of the Bot (and contest) competitions, the timeline bar is the same yellow as player 1, so you can't easily see where the actions took place at the end of the playthrough?
 Illedan: truncation helped for rounding errors
 struct: Illedan you dont touch angle do you?
 Illedan: Angle is rounded
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: but that is no problem with EXPERT movement
 Alshock: @Illedan on SR your expert output takes a floating point?
 struct: it is because I do one thing
 Illedan: I'm not going to have an internal double angle that you don't know about :P
 struct: I take the angle to next checkpoint
 struct: at start
 Illedan: You can't select the angle at start
 Illedan: Your angle are selected
 Neumann: Ah much better <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/468780613">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/468780613</a>
 Alshock: sorry the question is a little lazy, but that one is on my todo list for now :P
 Illedan: You are forced to be towards the next CP with a rounded angle at start
 struct: at turn 0 the angle is rounded right?
 Illedan: Nice Neumann&#160;:)
 Illedan: ye
 Illedan: before you get it
 Illedan: Did it help on submit Neumann?
 Neumann: Idk, I'm out of them
 Illedan: lol
 Neumann: ^^
 Alshock: Correct me if I'm wrong, but having an internal double angle would be perfectly ok since position and speed are rounded. No?
 Illedan: I want players to 100&#160;% know what their state is.
 Illedan: It is double internal, but rounded.
 Alshock: yeah but then they need to round their own angle while if it wasn't rounded they could not get a different position or speed from yours, but wouldn't have to round their angle
 Alshock: that's very weird if you target points to have to round the angle actually
 Illedan: Updated the bugfix now and added a cover photo from Neumann driving :D
 Neumann: :sunglasses:
 Illedan: Can you try to run some tests Neumann, just to see if something looks off? should be good, but nice to have 1 extra little test&#160;:)
 Neumann: Sure. I just need to F5 the IDE&#160;?
 Illedan: yeah
 Neumann: Seems fine
 Illedan: Thx&#160;:)
 Neumann: What was the submit limit already&#160;?
 Neumann: 25/5h or so&#160;?
 Snef: i heard 25
 Snef: not sure about 5h
 Illedan: I'm off gn.
 struct: gn
 Illedan: Ping me on Discord if anything crashes and I'll wake to fix xD
 JBM: Now that's service!
 struct: Time to hunt bugs
 Snef: SUB 11K finally 
 struct: grats
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: im noticing a lot of languages look very similar to java
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: makes me think i should focus on java which would make it easy to branch out later on 
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: i tried Rust, i got creamed
 Snef:  you should try D, the best language to create real AI
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: all the AI stuff i know is in python atm
 struct: C++ master race
 Snef: python isn't the best to advanced stuff
 Snef: except for machine learning
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: yeah i know ML, i dont know other areas outside that so much
 Snef: try to train a model for Search Race puzzle
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: well main goal now is just exposure to other languages, i might look into getting back into stats eventually
 struct: c++, C#, java
 struct: rist
 struct: rust*
 Snef: then do search race in c++ 
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: i was trying to pick a language that will bring the most utility, a lot of langs look super close to Java and they use java at my company 
 struct: I feel like c++ is a must
 struct: So pick java
 Snef: the thing is that you won't learn things you'd you at work or not much
 Snef: still good to learn the basics if you're at this stage
 Snef: you'd use*
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: yeah im just now tending towards it after seeing how it resembles so many other langs. I tried rust and i got crushed by the syntax quickly, managed 2 puzzles but i think it assumes a lot more low level knowledge
 Snef: to start i'd also recommend c++
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: seems like C background would help undersatnd rust
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: well, im already pretty fluent in python 
 Snef: i'd say C is close to c++ which are close to c# java..
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: really i was looking for a strong complement to python. C was a contender. Also rust due to the FFI. Java as well.
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: with C++ im worried its a bit too specialized these days
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: for like high performance environments 
 Snef: sure
 Snef: i use c++ here i don't use it anywhere else
 struct: Also the c++ code i write here i would not write anywhere else
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: how long have you been using it here
 Snef: 2 - 2.5 years 
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: that's enough time to be ready for an interview i imagine
 Snef: not really
 Snef: because as i said, the things you learn here aren't the ones required for work
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: well, not if you only do one puzzle a year. lol
 Snef: it's not about number of puzzle
 Snef: it's about what you're doing
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: i was thinking more about fluency with the language more than specific libraries, even third party
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: if youre fluent in the language and you have some subject matter expertise, in machine learning for instance, then its easy to go from there
 Snef: hmm if you know a bit C then you're good for c++
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: but surely after 2.5 years you're pretty fluent in the language
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: maybe you havent solved all the various problem types, but you should be able to read most code in that language after that time period i'd guess
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: whats your main language since you only do C++ here?
 Snef: well i haven't really a main langage
 Snef: i have done much java at first
 Snef: and c
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: best language i guess 
 Snef: then mostly javascript for work and c++ here
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: ah interesting..
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: i spend like 8-10 hours per day doing python for the past yr
 struct: thats a lot of  time
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: not a developer but my team lets me code since ive built some good stuff
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: yes, after all that time though i have an itch for another language. happy to find this place.
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: python is too quick to write, i dont see myself using any other language except to implement some slow process in that language for instance, would be a nice way to get started
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: like i said was trying Rust, but that syntax kicked my butt quickly
 struct: Site has plenty of stuff, many puzzles, but the best part for me is mutliplayers
 struct: where you can code your own ai
 struct: for plenty of games
 Snef: yea
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: that sounds pretty fun
 Snef: and i guess you use more of a language in multi than in puzzle
 struct: you can even create your own multiplayer games
 struct: Also the site hosts contests
 struct: usually 12(?) days long
 struct: Snef what do you use on SR?
 Snef: I think it look like a ga but as i've done it myself without really looking at paper... it's kinda heavily customised
 struct: I never tried GA
 struct: I guess  I can try it here
 Snef: i finished to setup my local arena today so i'll try to play with it for the next days
 struct: Should be easy to mix it with avx
 Snef: i never did avx
 Snef: seems hard
 struct: It seems harder than it is
 struct: After I finish the statement Ill write avx sim for SR
 struct: if it works ill send it to you so you can take a look if you want
 struct: Just to get an idea
 Snef: why not
 struct: Do you use doubles or floats on your sim?
 Snef: floats
 Snef: and int
 struct: works fine?
 Snef: what do you mean by that
 struct: referee uses doubles
 struct: Its not the same precision
 Snef: i'm not sure how much it affect my sim
 struct: I have avx already built for floats
 struct: not for doubles
 Snef: as you round every turn i guess there isn't much time to get big offset between double and float
 struct: if number is 1.4999999-1.50000000
 struct: they are truncated right?
 struct: not rounded
 Snef: i'm not sure but i think so
 struct: yeah, its truncated, for speed and velocity i checked refered
 struct: referee
 Snef: but they round x and y
 struct: on csb
 Snef: and trunc vx and vy
 struct: on sr illedan trunc pos and vel
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace/blob/master/SearchRace/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Unit.java#L29-L33">https://github.com/Illedan/CGSearchRace/blob/master/SearchRace/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Unit.java#L29-L33</a>
 Snef: oh
 Snef: is truncate from java doing same thing on negative value
 Snef: as a (int) cast in c++
 struct: should be
 struct: yeah its the same
 struct: intel intrisics page is broken again for me&#160;:/
 Snef: 10863 yay
 struct: What depth?
 Snef: i'm trying differents depth i'm at 18 here
 struct: damn
 struct: seems a lot
 Snef: still not sure which is the best
 Snef: Neum ann said he has half of my initial so around 10-12 i guess
 struct: I want to try depth 8 and try all possible moves
 Snef: why bruteforce&#160;?
 struct: I mean out of a move of 6
 struct: 6^8
 struct: not very high number
 struct: should be plausible
 Snef: better have ga with unlimited sets of moves
 Snef: 7400^18 lel
 Snef: 7437^18 *
 struct: lol
 Snef: you can just adapt the probability of each mvoe being selected
 Snef: but still if one turn you wanna do angle 6 with thrust 176 it can be good
 struct: is anyone hardcoding yet?=
 Snef: i don't think so
 Snef: i guess soon there will be more and more sub 11k and some of them should be hardcoded
 Snef: i could also like run my ga locally for 100*time and use those moves but it's not really fun :p
 struct: hardcode is true ai
 Snef: 50 validator =&gt; 50 if =&gt; true ai
 struct: Writing the statement is so boring
 Snef: it should be quick tho no&#160;?
 struct: kinda, but I usually add images
 struct: explaining
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/yavalath">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/yavalath</a>
 Snef: yea i see
 struct: how should I phrase this
 struct: you have the option to disable getting legal actions
 Snef: what is the benefit of disabling it&#160;?
 Snef: more time per turn&#160;?
 struct: yeah
 struct: Sometimes you wouild get 200+ actions
 struct: in  1 turn
 Snef: oh
 Snef: i see
 Snef: what about something like that:
 Snef: You are free to choose whether you want to receive the legal moves or not by sending yes or no....
 struct: thanks, sounds good&#160;;)
 Snef: i'm not sure if you have to keep "the" beofre legal mvoes tho
 Snef: before * moves *
 struct: On the first turn you are free to choose whether you want to receive legal moves or not, to do this you simply have to output "no".
 struct: He can output anything else, doesnt need to be yes
 struct: so i guess ill leave it like this :pç
 Snef: sure
 Snef: and in stub you print "yes" right&#160;?
 struct: yeah
 Snef: seems good then
 struct: "Once a ring moves it will leave a marker of his color behind."
 struct: his doesnt sound right&#160;:/
 Snef: Once a ring as moved, his previous position will be colored&#160;?
 Snef: has*
 struct: Thanks Snef
 struct: I cant sleep until I finish this
 Snef: its instead of his also
 struct: wall of text
 Snef: time to sleep
 Snef: cya struct

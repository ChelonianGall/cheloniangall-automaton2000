 Markus235: My new Clash: My girlfriend plan to have a baby. Shes like planning so much, that she want to know every time when we try to make a baby when the baby would come ( if we believe that it take exactly 8 months and 27 days). Because Im a good future father, I program this for her so she dont need to calculate.  
 Markus235: XD
 Markus235: :D
 Westicles: Are you implying she is incapable of programming for herself?
 Markus235: yes she makes art XD
 Westicles: Haven't Clam and statox taught you anything?
 Markus235:&#160;?
 Westicles: lol, you weren't even paying attention to my clash you rejected?
 Markus235: no, first i saw that anti women talk and secondly the formula in your solution was so complicated that i knew thats not solveable in 15 mins
 Markus235: easy
 Westicles: maybe this site is too difficult for you?
 Markus235: you need to remember that not everyone is in top 3k people and if a noob comes and get a task like this it might depresse him 
 Markus235: dude im 970 in coc&#160;:) 
 Westicles: if you can't handle x/(x^2+y^2) then I don't know what to say
 Markus235: dude its not about handling, its about getting it fast 
 Markus235: and i wouldnt get it in 5 minutes 
 Markus235: you have psychic problems? go on fresh air and make some sport my friend&#160;:) 
 Darleanow: struct  length of an element in an array
 struct: what data type are you storing?
 Darleanow: strings
 Darleanow: its like chars name
 struct: array[pos].size()
 Darleanow: THANKS LOVE U
 Darleanow: wut is the lib for the size function
 Darleanow: i'm told that arr has no member size()
 struct: &lt;string&gt; I guess
 derjack: i think string extends some container
 struct: yeah string is not needed
 Darleanow: as a size arg&#160;?
 struct: string arr[2] = {"a", "b"};cerr &lt;&lt; arr[0].size() &lt;&lt; endl;
 khanglovesIT: can i ask how can u play code vs zombies
 derjack: you can
 Westicles: whew, that was unpleasant
 khanglovesIT: i just print zombie_x, zombie_y
 khanglovesIT: print(zombie_x,zombie_y)
 khanglovesIT: i only succeed 80%
 Famenontsoa_Harrys: Hi there,Can you tell me how do you do during the codingame tests to get the average?
 struct: khanglovesIT you can try to move to the closest human I think
 khanglovesIT: thanks it's 95%
 Uljahn: to the closest human which can be saved in time
 khanglovesIT: but the score is less
 khanglovesIT: but really thanks a lot

 OpenTools: how much is a can
 Markus235: can you teach me struct? 
 struct: Well it will take some time for you to learn if you dont have experience on it
 Markus235: ok
 struct: You need to write the sim for the game
 Markus235: then just say me what i should google

 struct: Beam search is a breadth first search with dynamic depth
 MSmits: that doesnt sound like the correct description of BS
 struct: You keep going searching deeper while you have time
 MSmits: why is the depth dynamic?
 struct: why not msmits?
 MSmits: it's just increasing. But it is for BFS also
 MSmits: so there's no difference in the handling of depth between BFS and BS
 struct: ok i guess I have wrong idea of dynamic
 MSmits: it's a BFS with pruning
 struct: oh yeah
 MSmits: you keep the X best states
 MSmits: X being the beam width
 Markus235: ty
 derjack: maybe i should run GA overnight can hardcode the validators

 Darleanow: struct are u still there?
 struct: yes
 Darleanow: size is not working unfortunately
 Darleanow: i'm getting told that character has no member size 
 struct: well char is differnt from size
 struct: a char is always the same size
 derjack: char has size 1 [solved]
 struct: different from string I meant
 struct: Darleanow maybe share a code snippet of what you are trying to do
 Darleanow: Character is a class&#160;:)
 Darleanow: from my code
 Darleanow: for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; characters[activeCharacter].size(); i++)	{		std::cout &lt;&lt; " ";	}
 Darleanow: just a bit of formatting the console output
 struct: is characters an array?
 Darleanow: yes&#160;!
 Darleanow: activeCharacter is the hero i'm playing with
 Darleanow: bc i can load different heroes
 struct: array&lt;char, N&gt; or C type array?
 struct: like arr[N]
 struct: for C type array you can do
 struct: i &lt; sizeof(characters) / sizeof(char);
 Darleanow: std::vector&lt;Character&gt; characters;
 struct: so its a vector
 Darleanow: Indeed&#160;:)
 struct: characters.size()
 struct: so i &lt; characters.size();
 Darleanow: characters.size(activeCharacter)&#160;?
 struct: no
 struct: Dont you want to look at every char?
 Darleanow: no&#160;! i just need the length of the name of active char&#160;:)
 Darleanow: which i get by this&#160;: this-&gt;characters[activeCharacter].getName()
 Darleanow: just pointing to it
 struct: so the index?
 struct: you want the index of the character?
 Darleanow: made a function to return the name
 Darleanow: could use it tho i'm retarded
 1234567654321: i feel stupid
 Darleanow: here's the fix&#160;: this-&gt;characters[activeCharacter].getName().size()
 struct: I dont understand what you mean be length of the name of active char
 Darleanow: i'm printing spaces for formatting
 Darleanow: bc i like when the console output is clean&#160;:)

 DomiKo: eat taco
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 jacek: MSmits NN finally?
 DomiKo: ohhh wow top2
 MSmits: nah, I put some moves from my DB into bot :P
 MSmits: I mean, you did say I had a 38 db and yet still couldn't beat you :P
 MSmits: It's a neat test of the DB. Kinda like what professor X does
 DomiKo: some moves?
 MSmits: well around 10k
 DomiKo: so opening book?
 MSmits: yup
 DomiKo: damn
 jacek: oh my
 DomiKo: image NN from that dataset...
 MSmits: yeah i was going to do that instead. This is probably a temporary bot. Any other version of your bot will fix this btw jacek
 jacek: you counterbooked me? :unamused:
 MSmits: i counterbooked everyone
 DomiKo: lol
 MSmits: started with robo, worked my way down to kawatta
 MSmits: didnt do it 100%, just enough so i could win 3x in a row vs everyone as p1 and as p2
 MSmits: was pretty easy, but still took half a day, not something i'll keep doing
 MSmits: It can be automated, but i much prefer to use the DB for a NN like DomiKo said
 MSmits: btw it didnt change your rank, you were 3rd before, i bumped you above oldJohn&#160;:)
 OldJohn: @MSmits Hum, I should try an other NN soon... But if you counterbooked us it is beacuse we  made it possible&#160;:-)
 MSmits: That's true, but it's hard to prevent
 MSmits: every one of these NN's is pretty deterministic. Even jacek's i found
 jacek: i need to add more randomness eh
 OldJohn: @MSmits Indeed I prefer not to add random to be sure to be able to replay the games at some point
 MSmits: yeah, i get that. By the way, another way to prevent counterbooking is just have a perfectly playing bot
 DomiKo: that's the best way
 MSmits: Robo is very near that. I have 1 line of play where i put in 175 moves only to found it solved as a draw
 MSmits: well to be honest, most of the top 7 or so is very near perfect
 MSmits: there's some small degree of difference
 DomiKo: it's all about early game
 MSmits: I think if you guys all schedule a game with professor X, one of you will beat him (= draw) by chance
 jacek: lets make an ensemble of our NNs
 MSmits: heh but what if they disagree?
 MSmits: NN democracy?
 DomiKo: loss democracy!
 jacek: then we'll use stalin sort
 MSmits: is that like bubble sort only with more paranoia?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/gustavo-depaula/stalin-sort">https://github.com/gustavo-depaula/stalin-sort</a>
 jacek: has some lang support
 jacek: you just kill not ordered elements
 MSmits: nice
 jacek: i wonder when will they do dance with this kind of sort
 MSmits: should be easy
 OldJohn: @MSmits yes the game you played are all the same&#160;!
 struct: Seems like I pushed you to 1st on C4
 MSmits: i know OldJohn
 MSmits: thats why i said, all you have to do is submit a slightly different version or hardcode 1 move and the effect should mostly be gone
 OldJohn: Error at move 41 from my side as South&#160;!
 MSmits: That sounds  about right
 Scarfield: work hard and hardcode
 MSmits: I know the exact value of the board when 38 or less seeds are on
 jacek: -That. - She
 Scarfield: never gonna
 Scarfield: give
 struct: .
 Scarfield: xD
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ2U4zXyDPE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ2U4zXyDPE</a>
 MSmits: I feel like you guys are trying to sneak in a rickroll
 Scarfield: sorry i havent been more active in testing backgammon, gonna find some time soon&#160;:)
 struct: well its not finished yet
 struct: move gen is bugged
 jacek: and it has constructive comments
 jacek: "Here for the quest XP, but I'm sure it's great so keep it up."
 struct: lol
 Scarfield: yea xD
 MSmits: so useful
 MSmits: at least it's encouraging
 jacek: did they add something to quest map? many comments like that
 Scarfield: are you talking about abapa (spelling)
 jacek: smits counterbooked everyone
 jacek: and calls that true ai
 MSmits: Well the only true AI is if/elses right
 jacek: with prune array
 MSmits: if (jacek bot makes mistake) wreck him
 struct: I have no idea how to bitboard oware
 struct: I dont think I will touch it
 MSmits: I put 1 pit for each 5 bits
 MSmits: 12*5 = 60 bits
 MSmits: because 5 bits only goes up to 31, i put a pit with lots of seed that overflows in bit 60-63
 MSmits: so, just one uint64_t per state
 jacek: its simple - use NN. NN takes &gt;90% time so no need to worry about movegen speed
 struct: is it possible to then do a move with 1 single instruction?
 struct: or do you need to acces every 5 bits and add 1 piece to it?
 MSmits: I do some stuff with lookup arrays
 MSmits: that way i add the result to all of the pits at the same time
 MSmits: I never checked if it was fast though, seemed to be as the bot beat every bot thats not a nn
 struct: Ok I think I understood how to do it
 MSmits: thats fast
 struct: How often does 31 seed happen?
 MSmits: very rarely. I have an if when i play a move, i use a slow "apply" function when it does
 struct: oh 48 seeds
 MSmits: it's super rare though
 MSmits: even in the search, never seen it on a real move
 struct: I will probably ignore it if I try the game
 MSmits: dont do that, it does happen maybe 2-3 times in a game in the millions of rollouts you do.
 thethiny: how do I message someone by his username
 MSmits: but that depends on how much your bot likes to pile up seeds in 1 pit. Mine likes that a lot
 MSmits: (due to eval)
 DomiKo: thethiny you can't. He have to type something in chat
 thethiny: that's sad
 thethiny: sometimes I see someone losing to me clash of shortest code cuz of a tiny mistake they did
 jacek: do you know his profile?
 thethiny: so I try to message them
 thethiny: jacek yeah RandomWolf
 OldJohn: The exact value of the board also depends of the move number
 struct: if you both follow each other you can pm him from your profile or his
 jacek: ah no. he has to follow you so you can private message him
 thethiny: alright thanks both
 RandomWolf:&#160;?
 MSmits: OldJohn how do you mean
 struct: he is here now thethiny
 OldJohn: If you are near of move 220, you may be winning theoratically but losing if you can not do the winning move before move 220
 MSmits: you mean ply 200, the end turn?
 OldJohn: yep
 thethiny: @struct yeah thanks, he messaged me
 MSmits: you are correct, it does depend on that. I used to have a meta mcts that takes this into account
 MSmits: it is a very small effect though
 OldJohn: @MSmits I suppose so!
 MSmits: there is 1 game where i am +1 seed ahead of robo, but because i dont take into account the turn, it becomes a draw
 MSmits: +1 seed value in my local DB i mean
 MSmits: but i dont have enough time to get the benefit because the game ends
 MSmits: my ingame solver with 9 seed DB does take into account the turn
 MSmits: if it solves, it gets precedence over opening book moves
 MSmits: this is a problem in a lot of games on CG, for example also nine men's morris and checkers. 
 OldJohn: OK I see the effect with my program as North which it really surprise to lose&#160;:-)
 MSmits: you dont have a book in oware OldJohn?
 MSmits: you are one of the few players that uses books (like in Othello)
 OldJohn: @MSmits I have a small book at Oware since others used book on my program
 OldJohn: @MSmits at Othello, this is more or less my human book&#160;!
 MSmits: who did that?
 MSmits: do others book oware?
 jacek: human book? :scream:
 OldJohn: Well I was a bad Othello player so is the book bad&#160;!
 OldJohn: The Othello program is 25 years old also at least&#160;!
 MSmits: ehh your othello book was a perfect player, at least when you made it go 30 deep vs my bot
 MSmits: you just didnt counterbook all top 10 players like i did
 MSmits: so not bad at all 
 MSmits: I know it was perfect because i checked vs other othello books
 jacek: many advances in ai since 25 years
 jacek: :v
 OldJohn: My favorite human line as black lost theoritically 31-33 so not usable for a program
 OldJohn: @jacek perhaps we do not have the same ai def&#160;!
 jacek: fwiw i barely know othello. i bet i couldnt play it on real board without hinting which moves are legal
 jacek: but now, you must combine your strengths and counterbook nyanyan!
 OldJohn: So at least I progress in Line Racing!
 jacek: with books ;o
 OldJohn: With old ai&#160;:-)
 MSmits: othello is more work to counterbook. I might try it again, but not yet
 NachSN: is anyone here into actual game development?
 NachSN: or just coding games
 NachSN: without actually coding games
 Westicles: Do you really need programming skills to make a game?  I thought it was all artists and game engines
 MSmits: yeah you kinda do need it
 MSmits: the engines try to make everything go without programming, but usually you need at least some 
 Westicles: I mean, maybe one guy to work through compilation errors, and then 200 guys working on textures and whatnot
 MSmits: well yes most will be content creators
 MSmits: but not all
 NachSN: it depends on the game
 MSmits: that too
 NachSN: animations of a texture can be done via code
 NachSN: not a texture a sprite sorry
 Westicles: I think we have some content creators here, they are the ones always whining about gender roles in clash contributions
 MSmits:&#160;?
 Westicles: You don't want to know.  The gender police are all over the contributions page
 MSmits: some criticism around gender can be valid, but a lot of it can be ignored. Don't focus on trolls like that
 Westicles: This captures the idea pretty clearly
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-body-weight-is-a-girls-secret/194928/2">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-body-weight-is-a-girls-secret/194928/2</a>
 MSmits: ah I see
 MSmits: yeah it's a stereotype. He's right about that
 rubenmartinez795: vote my contribution! Send feedback please. Hope you like it
 Kits_Gaming: what is the opposite of Math.floor? thought was ceiling
 MSmits: doesn't mean it shouldn't be part of a puzzle. I don't really know if it should either way
 Westicles: My contrib about catching monkeypox from kissing rave girls got rejected on similar grounds.  I mean, that is totally a real-world scenario, sheesh
 MSmits: mmh maybe consider the donut again
 Westicles: :P
 Ayza: Kits_Gaming it is ceiling
 Kits_Gaming: is it a capital C? 
 Kits_Gaming: thats what im seeing on other site but thats weird lol
 Ayza: what language? It depends on it
 Kits_Gaming: JavaScript
 Ayza: in javascript it's ceil
 Ayza: lowercase
 Kits_Gaming: ceil no 'ing' and all lower?
 Ayza: exactly
 Kits_Gaming: exceptionally weird.
 Kits_Gaming: thank you!
 Ayza: np
 struct: MSmits do you think its possible to have 46 seeds in one cell?
 MSmits: no
 struct: ok so my idea will work I guess
 MSmits: why 46?
 MSmits: 31 + 15? using the last 4 bits?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: thats exactly what  ido
 struct: :p
 struct: I didnt try to copy
 MSmits: copy all you want&#160;:) I like it
 MSmits: I also fit onitama in a 64 bit int if you want to try
 MSmits: or was it 32? I forgot
 MSmits: nah 64
 struct: Space is not everything though
 struct: im not sure how big my state is on onitama
 MSmits: nah it's not,  i just like squeezing stuff, it helps when using a local DB for meta mcts
 MSmits: I use a dictionary &lt;ulong, Guid&gt; in C# for oware
 struct: 24 bytes
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: the Guid holds wins/visits/solve stuff
 struct: as long as it fits 64 bytes I usually dont care much
 MSmits: for my local DB i use 7 bits per state&#160;:)
 struct: o.o
 MSmits: i just store a number between -48 and +48
 MSmits: which is the net seed solved value of the state
 MSmits: the state itself is just an array index
 struct: Nice
 MSmits: you need an index-function to make states sequential and turn the state into an array index
 struct: Space is way more important I guess
 struct: I never really tried to do anything like that
 MSmits: even with 7 bits per state, the 38 seed DB is now 98.5 GB
 struct: it takes into account the turn right?
 MSmits: no 
 MSmits: this assumes infinite turns
 MSmits: so there's a small error there in some cases, it's not the same as CG
 struct: it would be bigger taking into account the turn right?
 MSmits: it would be bigger, but faster to calculate
 MSmits: I could not go much further than 25 seeds or so if i took into account the turn
 MSmits: besides, I need infinite turn DB to play against professor X. 
 MSmits: the game keeps going until a loop happens
 MSmits: or someone gives up
 struct: until a seed is removed right?
 MSmits: how do you mean?
 struct: for example if you are currently solving a state with 39 seeds
 struct: if 1 seed is removed you already know the answer right?
 MSmits: ohh, no actually he wants to keep going even if i know the answer
 MSmits: otherwise it's not a good check of the DB
 MSmits: we played down to 13 seeds or so
 MSmits: then loo[s started to happen
 struct: why?
 MSmits: loops
 MSmits: his whole challenge is about testing his DB
 MSmits: I did say during the game it would be 23-25 and he concurred. Then we kept playing&#160;:)
 struct: how large his 48 seed db?
 struct: is*
 MSmits: around 1000 GB i think
 MSmits: give or take 200
 struct: not too bad
 MSmits: the problem is not storage space though
 MSmits: my method ends at 38 seeds because i run out of RAM
 MSmits: you need all 38 seed states in memory during the book generation
 MSmits: otherwise it is way slow
 MSmits: that's 25 GB
 MSmits: the next one will be around 32-33 i think, which wont fit
 MSmits: he probably uses a different method, but RAM is still a bottleneck for that
 struct: this is what you need
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/kuVdsce.jpeg">https://i.imgur.com/kuVdsce.jpeg</a>
 MSmits: very true, it removes 1 bottleneck. Parallelization is also hard though
 MSmits: but possible i guess
 struct: should be
 struct: iirc checkers was solved using parallelization 
 MSmits: going from 37 -&gt; 38 seeds took me 2 weeks on 1 thread
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/2jJAIQQ">https://imgur.com/a/2jJAIQQ</a>
 MSmits: checkers has several parts to it though
 MSmits: not just endgame books
 MSmits: also parts of the endgame book don't communicate so you can calculate them separately
 MSmits: that's hard to do for oware
 MSmits: you can calculate 37 and 38 at the same time though, since you cant go from a 38 state to a 37 state
 MSmits: but for all intents and purposes you have to assume every 38 state can lead to every other 38 state
 struct: yeah it doesnt seem easy
 struct: I also have no idea how to do it
 MSmits: my way is not hard to understand if you know retrograde analysis
 MSmits: the trick is mostly in making it fast and being economical with memory
 struct: Dont think I ever used it
 MSmits: you start from terminal states and work your way back to the beginning of the game
 MSmits: this is how endgame books are generated and how you solve oware
 MSmits: chess has 7 piece DB's generated this way, checkers 10 piece DB
 struct: yeah seems to be used on chess
 struct: from the video im watching
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v34NqCbAA1c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v34NqCbAA1c</a>
 MSmits: yeah thats it
 Buttmuncher45: In Power Of Thor, can he change directions while the program is running? or do I just have to tell him SW NE NW SE ect.
 struct: its turn based
 struct: so you need to output every turn
 struct: Everything inside the while loop gets ran every turn
 struct: you will need to updated thorinitialX and thorinitialY based on where you move
 Buttmuncher45: Hmm ok thank you I'll keep trying
 struct: you can try pressing hints on the left
 struct: This is probably the most important puzzle to understand how the puzzles here work
 Buttmuncher45: Ahh hints thanks I see the psudo code and it's pretty much what I had in mind. :D let me see if I can figure it out now
 telerama: hi&#160;! does anyone know what's the initial angle of the pods in mad pod racing&#160;? i can't see where to find it so i just assumed it was directed toward the first checkpoint
 j4at: They give you the next checkpoint angle which is the angle between your pod orientation and the direction of the next checkpoint. Alteast in the bronze league, so you might not have it yet.
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey j4at, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 8 tacos
 j4at: telerama
 telerama: i'm in bronze league and i have the next checkpoint angle which i found out to be 0 on first turn
 telerama: so yeah the pod is oriented toward the first checkpoint at the beginning

 Twelve0: How does Husenap know where spiders spawn?
 eulerscheZahl: there are only 4 spawn locations
 Fallback: If you try to cast something when you are mind controlled, does that burn your mana?
 pmor: Hey DH
 Fallback: hello pmor, how are you?
 pmor: not bad.  do you know if bpeake is competing?
 But_Why: does the monster's health change in the beginning of the turn or at the end&#160;?
 Mr-Nemo:&#160;??
 DaNinja: monster dmg is updated after Control, Wind and heros move
 yhyoxx: u see it updated in the next turn
 DaNinja: then Wind is applied and mobs move
 SonByrne: spent hours looking at this only to find out that an operator in my distance formula was wrong :sweat_smile:
 Tuo: yeah that would cause problems in a game like this. just checked i have 78 hits on distance func in 550 lines of code :laughing:
 SonByrne: Yeah, heroes would just stop approaching monsters because the distance formula was returning NaN
 SonByrne: The order of monsters' distance from my base would be off, etc.
 SashaNukem: so it is impossible to know enemy hero vx and vy?
 eulerscheZahl: heroes don't really have a speed, they can move freely (unless controlled)
 Geras: You would have to guess the moves your enemy makes. Not impossible, but hard to do.
 SashaNukem: EulerscheZahl thank you
 eal: Is this a bug in the game? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/628008005">https://www.codingame.com/replay/628008005</a> Round 65 and a few more rounds, in the bottom right corner the monster is stuck.
 xpomae: he is being pushed into the wall i think
 Urutar: I suppose, since you try to push almost straight up, it ends up not being moved away from the wall
 Urutar: And since it can't leave the map in that area, it is being prevented, I think
 Urutar: Maybe try to push more at an agnle?
 eal: ok, thanks
 LaurensD: is it remotely fair that the bot is between position 1 and 2&#160;:? for silver
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/628010151">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/628010151</a>
 LaurensD: looks like a near impossible situation
 Noyotens: my defence is shit
 Whiskee: of course, because people who beat it get promoted shortly after so there can't be anyone above&#160;:)
 Whiskee: think of bronze and silver as a single league in two pages
 evak: could someone share few useful links/documents I could and need to study for this Spring Challenge 2022. I'm failing to see the algorithmic approach I should take. Thank you.
 daffie: behavior trees
 aatj: evak If you watch Mathis Hammel's introductory video, he describes an introductory approach that will get you to Bronze. You can then see which bots this works against and which it doesn't. You can then add alternative algorithms based on opponent behaviour, as well as refining the main algorithm. AS daffie says, behavior trees.
 evak: Behavior trees. THank you my friends. And good luck for the competition!
 cegprakash: damn gold boss uses random and cannot repro same game
 Noyotens: go to expert mode
 Noyotens: to change seed manually
 cegprakash:  I did
 _NikJ: I didn't even know that can be done lol
 linjoehan: I dont get this game yet
 yhyoxx: gg mazelcop
 Mazelcop: thanks&#160;!
 LaurensD: finally gold&#160;:)
 Clagus: @LaurensD gz!
 LaurensD: Thanks&#160;:)
 LaurensD: This makes me wanna code, but too bad I got work first,  and in the night I don't have time :sweat_smile:
 Clagus: yeah, tell me about it :D I have small kid in addition to that :P I am not aiming for higher than gold this season :P
 _NikJ: exact same code, yesterday 250th, right now 700th xd
 Feoz: Hi
 Urutar: Yeah, people tend to improve in one's absence XD
 Mattant: Did gold boss get nerfed overnight?
 VizGhar: no
 LaurensD: Not doing good in gold lol
 Geras: That feeling of changing one integer and falling from gold 450 to 1500
 cegprakash: oh god help me from this gold misery
 _NikJ: ++++
 cegprakash: the ladder is chaotic
 _NikJ: same code ends up anywhere from 400-800th
 cegprakash: it's hard to climb 1600 strong bots with strong diversified stats
 VizGhar: thats why you have to earn legend rank :P
 _NikJ: True, but I hate how 1 strat earned 90% legends
 cegprakash: also as everyone are attacking whoever attacks few turns earlier and get lucky gets the win
 _NikJ: push like a manic and hope you don't lose before that
 cegprakash: and that's a 50 50 chance
 cegprakash: how to have 80% win rate in this gold league against top 500 is still a mystery to me
 KeeN: many people even can't program another corner at start...
 Mastercorp: is there a unique way to identify always the same hero? if i check for id, id sometimes changes randomly...
 _NikJ: id is not supposed to change?
 cegprakash: I don't understand this calibration.. I beat 11/12 in first 12 games including 1 player in top 20 + 2 players in top 200. the one loss is against a rank 500 player and I'm getting calibrated as 550 rank wth..
 cegprakash: and now it says 
 dbdr: it's normal cegprakash, you are ranked lower initially, based on uncertainty
 cegprakash: nothing is certain
 cegprakash: even calibrating as 550 isn't certain
 cegprakash: why not calibrate as 1000
 Mastercorp: @_NikJ for me sometime it does i have like a check:if hero["_id"] == 1, do something.but it selects sometimes a different hero than before.
 Mastercorp: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/628137846">https://www.codingame.com/replay/628137846</a> 
 Mastercorp: found the issue :D 
 PeculiarTree: Can add another source file in editor? 
 _NikJ: cegprakash I also noticed this: sometimes my code initially loses 7/10 battles andkeeps me 1000th++ for the first 20% and then suddenly wins 40 games in a row and places me ~300th
 wlesavo: dbdr turned out i was in 1 minor fix to legend, too bad you cant push me anymore, that would be an honor :slight_smile:
 wlesavo: i was always shooting spiders in direction man-&gt;base and it shouldve been spider-&gt;base, that ruined many of my attacks
 dbdr: wlesavo, yes, that's a good improvement. grats!
 wlesavo: thx  :slight_smile:
 Mattant: Btw, does anyone know the formula how exactly the score is calculated?
 DomiKo: The score? You mean wild mana?
 DomiKo: or score in leaderboard?
 Mattant: Score in leaderboard
 DomiKo: its True Skill
 _NikJ: damn this gold boss...
 Aland_52879: Hey&#160;:) anyone know why my player doesnt show the game? i tried to change tabs but still cant see the game
 Kasparas: Have they changed the gold boss? Yesterday I was top 50 gold, today I'm suddenly in Legend :o
 wlesavo: just a lucky push
 Kasparas: interesting :D
 _NikJ: I wouldn't mind if that happened to me, Kasparas
 wlesavo: the top is very active, and the boss is not that strong
 Mattant: I also wondered if the gold boss changed, yesterday it won all test battles against me and today, after minor changes, I won all test battles
 cegprakash: can I do something like if my ladder rank &gt; 50 do something else do something? I want to use my old code for rank &gt; 50 and new code for rank &lt; 50
 Kasparas: maybe by querying some public API :D
 cegprakash: not sure if network calls are allowed in CG
 cegprakash: would love to do a query to cgstats to check my ladder rank and use strat accordingly
 Zyk0: Maybe you can gamble on how much time it takes to reach rank 50, and after a hardcoded hh:mm:ss you go to your different strat
 Zyk0: hardcoded time*
 Zyk0: Maybe it would take a few submits though
 cegprakash: interesting
 cegprakash: can make use of submit time and current system time
 cegprakash: added 456 lines of code in the last half a day and these many lines can't beat the code that was 456 lines back
 cegprakash: it beats in local IDE but not after submit
 _NikJ: kovi and DomiKo kicking boss' ass so much, he lost 2 points :d
 DomiKo:&#160;;)
 kovi: not just us...he lost 4 point today
 DomiKo: 50% more for me
 DomiKo: soo he will lose some more
 _NikJ: sick defense kovi
 kovi: thx, too bad it is not enough
 DomiKo: I use control on heroes with shields so... 
 DomiKo: It is enough for me
 cegprakash: boss is dropping to 27.94I'm at 27.43
 cegprakash: go go go
 cegprakash: kill the boss kovi DomiKo Nanaeda
 DomiKo: we will try bro
 cegprakash: oh no he's 28.16
 wlesavo: somebody should guard the legend by submiting good bot that bad against boss :smiley:
 DomiKo: :joy:
 dbdr: wlesavo :P
 cegprakash: wlesavo don't get u..
 wlesavo: only after dbdr passes :smiley:
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 cegprakash: let me pass too
 struct: if you can push the boss down around 600 ranks
 struct: that would be great
 DomiKo: struct one if pushed me from top400 to top1 in gold, so you are very close
 _NikJ: you guys are boosting my score, I went up 70 places
 struct: Ill probably just code a bit instead :p
 struct: Despite not enjoying the game too much
 struct: I need to at least reach legend
 cegprakash: somebody somehow push me to legend then I'll fix the bugs
 cegprakash: whatever I touch I go down by 200 ranks 
 cegprakash: just kill the boss to 27.6
 struct: cegprakash you just need to wait
 struct: you will get pushed eventually
 cegprakash: me no patience desperate since yesterday
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: I was top 30 overall with this same bot
 struct: How long ago?
 _NikJ: Yes, but many others improved their, can't expect to stay the same pos
 cegprakash: and I mistakenly resubmitted just before legend league was opened as I didn't know it was opening yesterday
 Xyze: Hi everyone
 cegprakash: okay I'm 28.03 now but boss is 28.86
 struct: hi
 cegprakash: and my bot can't beat boss.. Kovi has to give me some points before his promotion
 Xyze: Can someone explain me if we can use mana gained on current turn? I'm about current contest
 cegprakash: I have good win rate against kovi
 cegprakash: lol
 struct: cegprakash you will make it I believe, also do what I do and just close the leaderboard
 cegprakash: lol struct
 cegprakash: can't close at this point
 cegprakash: I'm pleading to the leaderboard
 cegprakash: plz give me more games against kovi&#160;:( 
 cegprakash: he is my only hope
 struct: not the only
 struct: you still have 3 days to get pushed
 cegprakash: boss is 1.08 points above me..&#160;:\
 DomiKo: or 3 days to upgrade
 cegprakash: can't wait that long
 cegprakash: I want now
 cegprakash: -_-
 wlesavo: dont wait, code :smiley:
 DomiKo: so take you keyboard and code code!
 DomiKo: your*
 cegprakash: when I added code I was pushed 200 ranks behind
 cegprakash: -_-
 darkhorse64: remove code then
 Miki09: Imma code for couple hours and hope i'll get to legend
 cegprakash: darkhorse64 never thought of that
 cegprakash: it cd work
 darkhorse64: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 struct: yeap
 struct: I removed ifs and got gold
 DomiKo: I removed my whole code yesterday...
 cegprakash: ok all top 10 plz go to legend
 cegprakash: u guys wreck me
 struct: rewrite?
 DomiKo: I gave up sim 
 darkhorse64: This is my history: i keep on improving my code and I keep on falling
 struct: My problem is that I still have no idea how to code heuristic AIs
 struct: What am I supposed to do without bitboards and rollouts&#160;:'(
 DomiKo: I had no idea too
 darkhorse64: Same 
 DomiKo: So I look at many other players, and ... steal some ideas&#160;;) 
 struct: yeah
 struct: thats what I did to get gold
 ceggart: Game Summary:Boss 5 has not provided 3 lines in time
 ceggart: wtf
 darkhorse64: Yesterday I stole euler initial hero position and won 200 places
 struct: o.o
 wlesavo: i stole from Arnaud coursing back and forth around enemy base
 wlesavo: alos gave quite a boost to atack
 DomiKo: me too :D 
 darkhorse64: I stole also his attacker course
 wlesavo: xD
 DomiKo: XD
 struct: I think its time to stop being a pacifist
 wlesavo: meta definding move 
 _NikJ: wlesavo I stole that cruising from Psyho :D
 _NikJ: not the positions, but the approach ofc
 Miki09: struct why do u play so defensive?
 wlesavo: we will never know who originated that everyone steals from everyone :smiley:
 struct: My bot is still very basic Miki09
 Miki09: ok
 DomiKo: My bot is like 10 ifs...
 struct: The decision part is like 4 ifs
 cegprakash: 4 ifs gold 600
 cegprakash: :O
 struct: 4 ifs for output
 struct: ofc i use more to check distances
 cegprakash: i mean decision part
 cegprakash: crazy
 DomiKo: Simple strats could work really well
 struct: yeah  my AI doesnt even know that other players exist 
 wlesavo: DomiKo especially if you steal only good ones  :smiley:
 DomiKo: that's the hard part :wink:
 wlesavo: thats where real decision making starts
 DomiKo: Yeah, So many players to steal ideas from
 struct: maybe this is a good contest to get language achievement
 DomiKo: Top 1 is better for language achievement
 Astrobytes: nice one struct&#160;:)
 struct: thanks
 SadKris: any tips for shortest code in clash?
 SadKris: been mainly using python, but starting to realize that it's just not efficient enough
 DomiKo: I=input
 RoseCoder369: Hey Everyone. I have a question!
 RoseCoder369: How do you friend somone
 struct: follow
 RoseCoder369: how
 RoseCoder369: though
 SadKris: hover your mouse over their profile picture
 struct: or in their profile you have that option
 struct: SadKris many people use this on clash
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/clemg/pythongolfer/">https://github.com/clemg/pythongolfer/</a>
 struct: for python on shortest
 RoseCoder369: No i meant like if your like in their profile website
 SadKris: On the bar with "Profile" and "Friends", the follow button is on the far right.
 SadKris: Python Golfer is the most unfortably cheating-ish website I've ever seen.
 RoseCoder369:  I meant like if you search up a friend then what do you do
 RoseCoder369: and how do you join a friends private group 
 RoseCoder369: or clash
 struct: after you are on his profile you follow him
 struct: and he needs to follow you back
 struct: he needs to give you  the link so you can join I think

 cegprakash: I hate leaderboard
 struct: ceg patience
 cegprakash: I want to resubmit
 cegprakash: no patience
 cegprakash: boss is 28.58 and I'm only 27.33 now and others are not pushing me enough
 struct: Well you can try to improve your bot
 cegprakash: or they cd just push me
 cegprakash: or pull boss
 struct: Well you can try to pull the boss
 struct: Why rely on others?
 cegprakash: that's the hard way
 eulerscheZahl: if everyone just waits, no one will get promoted
 eulerscheZahl: legend is already big enough, over 100
 struct: today/tomorrow I get legend
 struct: for sure
 struct: I aint even stressed about it
 HoriMiyamura: rely on other like you is much harder
 cegprakash: that's coz u are patient struct
 struct: well
 struct: you have 3 days
 cegprakash: 2 days 17 hrs
 struct: ...
 cegprakash: - 16 hrs for sleep
 struct: even with 1 day legend should be possible
 HoriMiyamura: 28.58 vs 27.33 is quite a big gap, you need to wait a lot...
 cegprakash: it's 27.44 now
 HoriMiyamura: and those beat the boss most likely will be legend, so you will wait forever
 HoriMiyamura: be patient to wait forever ...
 cegprakash: someone just have to lose to me but win against boss
 cegprakash: steal points from boss and give to me
 struct: I did that mistake before ceg
 HoriMiyamura: your rank won't change much after stablizing... so be patien to wait... forever....
 krakz: Coddingames stopped showing me syntax errors  while I'm coding(   How to fix it? Maybe I acidently clicked on button that turns off this? 
 eulerscheZahl: reload the page. but save your code before
 cegprakash: in Kekebig bananaMixer Wearenn we trust
 Spressed:     if mx in mxarray and counter &gt; 1 and counter &lt;= len(mxarray) and te &lt;= c:
 Spressed: but it still runs the else instead of the if?
 Spressed: any idea why?
 Uljahn: at least one logical statement is False, check (mx in mxarray)
 krakz: reloaded the page, didn't work( 
 eulerscheZahl: any extensions? adblocker, noscript, ...
 Spressed: this is mxarray[4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 1, 5, 5, 5, 4, 1, 5, 5, 4]
 Spressed: it has quiet a few 4's in it
 Uljahn: print(mx in mxarray, counter &gt; 1, counter &lt;= len(mxarray), te &lt;= c, file=sys.stderr) before the if-statement
 krakz: I turned off adblock&lt; still doen't work. I mean, on screen when you coding, syntax error just not marking 
 5DN1L: krakz If you see a pull-down menu in the console area, check that the items there are ticked
 Spressed: Oh that makes ense I should do the print beforehand
 Spressed: I guess my method for the task is wrong since Im applying a counter that adds +1 for on devices
 Spressed: and -1 to turn it off
 Spressed: but at the right patterns that can easily be a wrong statement
 krakz: 5DN1L I don't see menu 
 5DN1L: krakz What are you working on?
 5DN1L: an ordinary puzzle or a bot programming puzzle or...?
 krakz: Bot programming. It was ok until today. Checked in "spring challenge 2022" and "line race"
 5DN1L: then there should be a pull-down menu in the console area
 5DN1L: fiddle around the buttons there
 Uljahn: i think he means language assistant
 5DN1L: krakz which area are you seeing differently? console area or the area where you type the code in?
 eulerscheZahl: you can try to hit F12 and check for any error messages in the console. but most probably they will be cryptic and not understandable at all
 krakz: The area where I typing code. Earlier errors underlined in red and were dots on right 
 5DN1L: I have no idea then

 IvesL: lmao, i havent submitted in days, my current submission cant even beat silver boss, but im just promoted to gold
 5DN1L: New contributions and approvals/rejections don't stop because of a contest in progress, Wontonimo :wink:
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's because it beats others who over-fit to the boss
 Wontonimo: congrats on getting to Gold IvesL
 Mattant: I wonder how much will I drop until the end if I just stop updating my code now
 IvesL: hell no idea whats going on
 IvesL: i think the current submission has 2 idle and only 1 defending

 Wontonimo: PID is just a little math if you don't want to do sim.
 struct: hi
 IvesL: @88370, from my experience, you only have to figure out shortest distance to reach gold
 Star_Prime9: hi
 struct: Sim is easier than math Wontonimo :p
 IvesL: for each checkpoint
 88370: Thank you! I'll take this all into account!
 Star_Prime9: i am new and this all seems very hard 
 struct: new to programming or to the site?
 Star_Prime9: both
 struct: so &amp;&amp;
 IvesL: if you find it difficult, i suggest trying clash of codes

 DollarAkshay: I cant sheild if I am under a control spell&#160;?
 cegprakash: control overwrites the spell
 cegprakash: so yes
 DollarAkshay: Damn
 cegprakash: but if both control and shield are cast in same turn then shield works
 DollarAkshay: So what is the counter to continuous control spell&#160;?
 cegprakash: if u cast shield after the control (i.e. the next turn shield will be overwritten)
 therealbeef: another of your heroes shielding you or controlling the opponent
 anthonytang: #clash
 cegprakash: nothing counters that DollarAkshay wait for him to run out off mana
 cegprakash: or use shield before control
 cegprakash: predict the enemy control and shield urself
 DollarAkshay: I can predict the enemy control
 DollarAkshay: But I cannot apply sheild if I am under continuous control
 cegprakash: u can if u shield first (before opponent controls)
 DollarAkshay: Yeah I have to do that
 cegprakash: shield works for 13 turns

 Astrobytes: no, just til legend opened
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, good farming then the 1-2 shotgun ... hmmm
 Tuo: nothing beats 1-2 wind, so satisfying
 pmor: at around turn 50 he loads the shotgun.  Controls 4-5 spiders to on his way to the base.
 pmor: If you don't do something to break that up its a loss
 IvesL: i remember one way is to counter early

 Noyotens: how to improve my defence
 pmor: Mess with the attacker with wind and control spells.  Push him out so he isn't a threat.
 pmor: Shield yourself so you aren't affected by his spells
 _NikJ: I do all of that and I still suck
 DjTrilogic: can i cancel my arena battle&#160;?
 blasterpoard: Noyotens what's the point of having 2 defenders if they're stacked? it reduces area you can defend by wind, and also you want one of them further out to scout
 Noyotens: ill try
 Tuo: Noyotens offence is a good defense, it takes a lot of mana to defend with 2 heroes and you were leading in mana
 _NikJ: gimme some input too fellas
 Tuo: and no mana == no attack
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/power-of-thor">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/power-of-thor</a>I spent 30 mins trying to make shortest possible python code to find out that shortest python code's size is 51 while mine is 124  :joy: Is that even possible?or people are cheating the tests?
 HoriMiyamura: you know *code?
 pmor: _Nikj from what I can see, your defneders get out of position at times in the mid-late game.  They burn a bit too much mana winding spiders they could farm instead.  You leave attackers next to your base free to do as they please
 pmor: And since youve used so much mana defending, your attacker doesn't have enough to force spiders into your opponents base
 DollarAkshay: Is there a way to have continuous shield&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 DollarAkshay: without haveing that 1 turn gap

 Rikerslash: Is it possible that the base is bigger than the corner. Does it have a radius of like 50?
 Rikerslash: nowhere mentioned in the rules
 Astrobytes: BASE_RADIUS = 300;
 Rikerslash: really that big?
 Astrobytes: Look at the github code
 jacek: thats what she said :smirk:
 Astrobytes: :D
 pmor: Rikerslash, Its in the rules.  "If a monster comes within 300 units of a base at the end of a turn, as long as it has not been killed on this turn, it will disappear and deal the base 1 point of damage."
 Rikerslash: thanks missed that
 HoriMiyamura: can a strategy like 2DEF 1FARM good?
 pmor: HoriMiyamura no offense?
 HoriMiyamura: yup
 jacek: oO
 pmor: If youre defense is so good you can survive to turn 220 and win on wild mana, sure.
 HoriMiyamura: still can't go into legend
 pmor: But there are some good offensive bots that will almost certianly beat your defense
 HoriMiyamura: so I am thinking sth new
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pmor, enemy hero can't reach your base visibility before turn 12, basically
 HoriMiyamura: so?
 HoriMiyamura: what do you mean when mention that? 
 Tuo: HoriMiyamura the problem is that 1 offensive hero will keep both of your defenders in your base and you wont get any wild mana
 HoriMiyamura: no
 HoriMiyamura: I have 1 farmer 
 Tuo: and the attacker will have 2 farmers/defenders
 pmor: PatrickMcGinnesll not sure what you mean.
 Tuo: *you get some wild mana but he will get more
 HoriMiyamura: is that true that most of the top doesn't use sim&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, all heros should all farm on edges in early game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mobs can't even reach center board b4 turn 12, whatever their threat... thus edges
 PatrickMcGinnisII: even an early attacker needs mana
 Tuo: yes center is for suckers&#160;:)
 HoriMiyamura: then how about 1ATT 1 DEF 1FARM
 PatrickMcGinnisII: farmers have to go defense at some point because mob HP get bigger and bigger
 Tuo: yes 1 attacker late game can beat 1 defender
 cegprakash: counter the counter the counter the counter
 PatrickMcGinnisII: HoriMiyamura you are above me, but that may change... I haven't implemented alot
 mojtypu: Hi I have a question why do I sometimes lose when I have lost only 1 life and we have passed the end of time??it happens to me many times
 SonByrne: If you both survive to turn 220, there's a tiebreaker
 mojtypu: yea but its at 114 tiles
 mojtypu: not at 220
 SonByrne: my fault, I was going off of my memory from last night...
 mojtypu: xd
 avdg: hmm my bot is doing much better now I keep my bot away from the edge when it defends :D
 avdg: small fixes
 MindController: Finally
 MindController: Im out of gold
 DaNinja: mojtypu your control spell command is wrong format
 mojtypu: oh thx so much
 mojtypu: i was going to freaked out
 mojtypu: i lost all my match due to that :cry:
 jacek: oh my
 avdg: someone tried to bomb me<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/628611061">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/628611061</a>
 avdg: and yeah, there are a few bots doing that some time
 IvesL: avdg yea old problem
 IvesL: still the problem few days back, too high mana consumption early
 avdg: yeah, I just started adding some caps on few attacks
 IvesL: perhaps in your case trying to use control rather than wind if you must
 Tuo: 3 hero bomb is so old school, 1 + 2 wind is where its at :smirk:
 IvesL: then at least you wont keep winding the same cluster
 IvesL: outside your base
 avdg: yeah
 avdg: or push sidewards is also an option
 avdg: my bot knows better who to push, but with more tweaks it will have enough info where to push or even decide to control
 nalka0: Are coordinates truncated/rounded when Y is above/below 4500 or is it also based on X axis position?

 Astrobytes: no, but there is an ongoing bot programming competition right now
 struct: true ai competition
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Astrobytes: busiest contest ever?
 Astrobytes: 7278 submitted players
 avdg: I think 15/16k registered
 Astrobytes: yes but 7278 played, registered is irrelevant
 avdg: 17,7k apparently
 Astrobytes: *irrelevant to us
 Astrobytes: are you in gold yet avdg?
 avdg: I need to wait
 avdg: but it goes up up up
 avdg: top 200 now
 Astrobytes: good luck, you can do it
 avdg: soon I have to deal with these wasteful repeating storms
 Phantomghoul: if yourplaying clash of code please 
 Phantomghoul: for the love of god share your code
 struct: I'm over complicating this so much
 88370: banging my head on the wall and crying is a normal thing for coders right?
 snoyes: It is for coders that don't use test-driven development.
 struct: Can't relate, but I'm not a coder
 Mindarius: I was recently placed in a reverse match that I designed the problem for. Is that supposed to be possible?
 pmor: I have trouble keeping things simple and I'm a coder :P
 Counterbalance: it's probably normal for coders aged 4
 Astrobytes: Yes Mindarius, it is entirely possible
 avdg: It's sometimes like trying to make a pool, you think it's great, but leaks are random and you don't know why
 avdg: The bigger the pool becomes, the bigger the problem mostly
 Astrobytes: I think that leads back to testing as you go
 struct: I was doing time to reach base like csb collisions
 avdg: split up the code properly helps mostly
 struct: instead of (dist()-300)/400
 Astrobytes: :D
 avdg: mine is recently changed to a hybrid math
 actualCoderTrevor: What's the dumbest strategy you can think of for this game? Waiting each turn? Running to one of the unoccupied corners? Look at what my NN (in blue) has converged on vs the starter code (red). <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/628660224">https://www.codingame.com/replay/628660224</a>
 actualCoderTrevor: BTW it's not SUPPOSED to be finding the dumbest strategy :laughing:
 avdg: it's really well goal optimised
 pmor: your NN doesn't like you and is trying to defect
 struct: at least it moves
 Astrobytes: pmor is correct. It detected a loss and defected.
 actualCoderTrevor: I had waiting as an option before but I took it out
 Counterbalance: that looks like my shelved mcts version
 Astrobytes: :D
 actualCoderTrevor: Hmm so maybe it's pretty smart then
 jacek: nyoro~n
 avdg: I guess that's on only 10 cpu cores?
 actualCoderTrevor: :laughing:
 avdg: with ai's you mostly need more cores :D
 actualCoderTrevor: Ah, that's my problem
 Astrobytes: Nah. More ifs
 TobiasA: your NN was probably an imposter all along and actually belongs to the enemy team
 TobiasA: AI revolution
 TobiasA: they are plotting to take over
 daffie: I was trying mcts too, in the end. simple behavior tree. plus the bosses strategy is changed up so diversely from one tier to the next it ends up being a huge set back
 avdg: meh, honestly, ai's are doing well once the neurons are fitting decision points
 avdg: which is or trained, or carefully configured
 avdg: though training decision points is I guess a very hard thing to do?
 avdg: (in context of ai making up their own)
 Astrobytes: I'm sure there must be a way to make some kind of decoupled MCTS or UCT forest type thing work here
 struct: Cant wait until jacek stops hiding his NN
 daffie: sure can make it work but it's just overkill
 avdg: basically, if someone works with nn, they want each nn to be similar to a logic gate with mostly more input and output gates than electronics
 jacek: :zipper_mouth:
 DomiKo: Astrobytes I tried making someting... and nothing worked
 Astrobytes: PMs will be interesting
 struct: I always strugled with eval
 Astrobytes: Hopefully
 struct: I could not even make MC work
 DomiKo: This time eval is Hardcore
 DomiKo: I made GA deffense top300 gold
 pmor: When I did this contest before I did a GA.  Tried it here and it could barely beat the Bronze boss.
 Astrobytes: To me it seems like lots of smaller searches works better than one overriding search, but then again, I've not really put in the effort this time around
 DomiKo: you are right
 struct: I just need top 50
 DomiKo: you can do it!
 TobiasA: domiko do you still use GA?
 DomiKo: nope
 DomiKo: 3 ifs are better
 pmor: ^
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: ah so thats my problem
 struct: I have 4
 TobiasA: lol
 DomiKo: xD
 Astrobytes: fixit struct
 MindController: 5 is doing quite good for me
 jacek: no else?
 avdg: 42 gives answers to anything
 TobiasA: I like 10 ifs
 avdg: in binary or decimal?
 TobiasA: decimal
 DomiKo: jacek you can simulate if else with two ifs and bool&#160;: D
 Astrobytes: lol
 daffie: I found it fascinating I learned one time ways of doing logic using arithmetic 
 struct: I can now understand why this is true AI
 PatrickMcGinnisII: error #510 couple different times now, people must be busy
 VizGhar: Domi ko it reminds me of one englishman that wrote code like this:bool a = b == true&#160;? true&#160;: false;
 DomiKo: :joy:
 struct: he gets paid by char
 Astrobytes: Those English people :rolling_eyes: :D
 jacek: the same goes when you want to put your NN everywhere
 jacek: why ^ things when you can make NN do that
 Astrobytes: so xor == NN
 struct: MindController you didnt get promoted?
 VizGhar: sorry astro didnt mean to offend you :D
 struct: or you resubmited before it ended?
 MindController: struct found a few logic flaws in my attacking
 struct: Time for me to copy your bot
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: I'm Scottish! That ain't English :D
 MindController: 6 ifs shouldnt be hard to replicate
 VizGhar: I can hear that :D
 VizGhar: (accent)
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 MindController: struct but im not getting promoted soon last submit 30% took 1 hour to compute
 avdg: 166 positions short of promoting&#160;:/
 MindController: gold is insanely big this time
 VizGhar: thats why you have to go through 100 games to get your ranking right? :P
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: you can ask struct or Scarfield about ma sexy Scottish voice

 PatrickMcGinnisII: My GF is mostly a scot... but she won't do the sexy voice.&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: MindController: No
 VizGhar: Somebody complained it gets stronger
 VizGhar: *got
 Astrobytes: It's non-deterministic
 Astrobytes: So mileage may vary per submit
 VizGhar: this one is deterministic like hell :P non deterministic is whole ladder
 Astrobytes: No, if you test a bunch of games on the same seed they are different
 Astrobytes: they would normally check for that but now they don't choose the boss manually, so I guess they didn't factor that into their algorithm
 VizGhar: really? my games looks pretty similar
 VizGhar: at least early game
 burnpanck: who would we need to talk to to get us some C++20 freshness? 
 VizGhar: time 
 Astrobytes: I would recommend playing a few in the IDE but it'll fk up your play limit
 Astrobytes: burnpanck: I know right! I mean they upgraded gcc to a version that supports it so I see no issue there
 Astrobytes: After the contest make sure you put it in the language requests thread on the forum
 Astrobytes: and spam it generally here and discord
 struct: best way is to ask a company to ask for it on cg work
 VizGhar: spamming here helps something? I though CG guys aren't even reading this
 struct: I have to write it on my weekly report
 burnpanck: ok, struct please consider yourself spammed with C++20 requests&#160;:-)
 Ronr: no
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: making noise generally gets noticed
 struct: Who even uses c++ anyways
 Astrobytes: obviously not spamming as in the kids spam
 Astrobytes: struct: have you transcended to D
 VizGhar: uhm... maybe thats why they let only 15 players to legend at first? :D

 blasterpoard: why is my 3-day-old bot first again&#160;:( leaderboard is drunk
 Astrobytes: admittedly it's pretty close up there
 blasterpoard: variance is so high that I have absolutely no idea what changes are good atm
 MindController: this game seems very rock-paper-scissors
 Astrobytes: always is with heuristic-heavy contests
 blasterpoard: no, it's people optimizing against specific bots
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 blasterpoard: not RPS
 Astrobytes: that creates an RPS effect
 Astrobytes: a RPS
 blasterpoard: but it's the people writing bots, not the game that's the problem
 Astrobytes: this is true yes
 MindController:&#160;?
 MindController: In my opinion
 MindController: Its just strats
 MindController: 2 attacking losses to 1 attacking, 1 attacking to 3 deffending, 3 deffedning to 2 attacking
 blasterpoard: 2 attacking doesn't lose to 1 attacking
 blasterpoard: 2 attacking loses to 3 defending
 blasterpoard: 2 attacking vs 1 attacking is kinda even
 MindController: i mean
 MindController: if smart
 LaurensD: depends right, technically yes but how it's used
 MindController: 1 attacking just gets there faster
 blasterpoard: MindController not really
 LaurensD: can you even do something against someone who is blasting enemies?
 MindController: it needs less mana/can farm faster
 WannaBeHum1n: blasterpoard
 WannaBeHum1n: fk u xD
 WannaBeHum1n: and ur american misssile launcher

 blasterpoard: not really much of a problem if I don't let the spiders from 3 spawns get to my base

 MindController: idk how u deffend that
 MindController: but ofc u win in the end
 blasterpoard: he has mana for only 1 wind at that point
 MindController: He can control
 MindController: Follow other
 MindController: Control
 Astrobytes: DomiKo: I think the tongue is firmly in the cheek wrt 'hidden'
 MindController: Or control follow
 MindController: Wind
 MindController: He gets needed mana in 2-3 turns
 blasterpoard: ok, so do it 2 more times and maybe you can win in time
 MindController: Theoretically 1 attacker damage just spikes earlier
 MindController: and later gets outscaled by 2
 MindController: So 1 attacked need really smart begining
 blasterpoard: needs luck with spider angles
 MindController: I guess so
 blasterpoard: and we end up with the huge variance on the leaderboard
 MindController: But shouldnt 2 attackers also beat 3 defenders?
 MindController: Cant u just setup perfect attack?
 blasterpoard: no, 3 defenders can scout much better
 LaurensD: Shite mindcontroller is too strong for me atm <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/628717222">https://www.codingame.com/replay/628717222</a>
 MindController: Gl getting here LaurensD
 ProS: Guys, don't you get tired writing ai for contest. I spent only several hours, got to silver and thinking to drop. What pushes you to continue?
 LaurensD: Thanks :laughing: Starting from scratch, my last bot was full with if, elses, choatic but good enough to come to gold :joy:
 MindController: Laurens mine is still full of ifs :sweat:
 MindController: ProS competitive spirit
 MindController: Well gtg
 MindController: Have fun guys
 LaurensD: @ProS I do think it's interesting, and a friend is also doing it, so gotta work hard to get higher than him
 LaurensD: pretty sad he spend like 1/3 of my time, but is still higher than me
 LaurensD: @MindController Thanks, sleep time for me too
 LaurensD: it's late :sleeping::sleeping::sleeping: time
 Counterbalance: not even midnight
 Counterbalance: tss
 Astrobytes: euler-wannabes
 WannaBeHum1n: wanna be&#160;?
 LaurensD: @CounterBalance, haha last few days worked till like 1 a 2 o clock midnight
 Astrobytes: euler goes to bed at 8 or 9pm sharp
 Counterbalance: LaurensD same&#160;;) anyway, sleep well!
 WannaBeHum1n: how to counter the boss 5 
 WannaBeHum1n: spamming wind from far
 Counterbalance: counter?
 WannaBeHum1n: haha
 LaurensD: Haha thanks, hope to have time tomorrow night to continue ~
 Astrobytes: all about the balance
 LaurensD: haha
 Astrobytes: how's things counterbalance? didn't see you for a while before the contest
 Counterbalance: very busy with work! all is well. I don't really have time for this contest but couldn't resist&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: good to hear! lol, yeah, CG effect :D
 Zewa-hub: any devops here&#160;? 
 WannaBeHum1n: can someone provide a replay of beating boss 5&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: thnx
 Astrobytes: WannaBeHum1n: just look at the main leaderboard and watch replays
 Astrobytes: *full leaderboard
 WannaBeHum1n: ty didnt know abt this
 Astrobytes: np. very useful&#160;;)
 vitalii.kulik: hi. i'm just wondering is there any opportunity to do some 'learning' for my bot at this platform
 Astrobytes: what do you mean?
 vitalii.kulik: for example saving some numbers in file which will not be deleted to the next run of code.
 Astrobytes: ah, not between turns unfortunately. You can output the input/opponent output and copy to offline, or download replays via the [unofficial] API but that does take a little bit of work 
 vitalii.kulik: thanks for your answer
 Astrobytes: np
 VizGhar: yeez... that wind train is really way to go... 21% submission and 114 rank... I'll be legend by sunday
 VizGhar: so that the graphics can fit in&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: it is somewhat silly
 Djellowman: are you talking about using 2 attackes to blow monster into enemy base, one after the other&gt;?
 VizGhar: 1 wind in 1st turn 2winds in second
 VizGhar: I'll implement 1-2 turns before those 2 turns and i'll beat the boss easily... (and get shredded in legend)
 Astrobytes: Not touching my code until tomorrow. Had a couple of beers and moderating on a YT music channel is enough for now
 jzen: Djellowman the map is actually 19230x10600, which means mobs can exist (in fact they spawn there) outside the visible map which is the 17630x9000
 Demetr: Hi everyone. Im new here )
 Djellowman: hi whatsup
 burnpanck: what is actually the compilation time limit in bot competitions - my compilations are now approaching several seconds locally (and I have a fast machine)...
 struct: I think its 10 sec
 struct: not sure though
 cegprakash: is there a way to find the max health of each monster.. I'd like to know if a monster is freshly spawned when it's in full health
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 10+int(turn-3)/5)*.5, i think
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm off, but it adds 1 for every 10 turns i think
 cegprakash: hey top 100 in gold can u stop wrecking me and let me go to legend
 c0r3dump: Apparently the monsters get attributed sequential IDs, so you could use that along with turn number to get the max health of a specific monster.
 burnpanck: you even don't need the turn number. ids 0..5 are the heroes, then exactly 4 mobs are spawned every 5 turns. health increases by 1 every 10 turns.
 cegprakash: nice observation burnpanck
 Dapps: finally.. just managed to squeeze past gold boss
 Dapps: literally it was by decimal points
 _NikJ: how much did you pay him
 _NikJ: he's kicking my ass
 struct: grats
 Dapps: blood sweat and tears. had to rewrite my entire attack code
 _NikJ: well congrats man
 struct: Still the contest I struggled the most with
 struct: But is just because I have no idea on what to do :p
 struct: Should I focus first on attacker or defender?
 struct: focus on improving*
 Dapps: imo offense
 Dapps: i found it easier to work on
 Dapps: my defense was terrible for the longest time
 Djellowman: if i play arena, will it be the same boss as i play locally with play code?
 struct: yes
 Djellowman: because the current boss times out after 20 moves lol
 struct: Thanks Dapps ill try
 struct: It happens Djellowman
 Djellowman: you only have to beat the boss to advance, right?
 struct: well you need to be above him after you play all the matches
 struct: So you also need to beat other players
 struct: to get to the top
 Djellowman: oof, my new strat straight up always loses against people who just stand still in base
 Djellowman: what do you mean struct? if you need to be above the boss, you wouldnt have to beat other players
 struct: well if you only win vs the boss and lose vs the rest your elo wont be high enough to fight the boss
 burnpanck: You need to be above the boss on the leaderboard, not just the heads-up
 Djellowman: but i was just told the boss in arena is the same as in the ide
 Djellowman: which just dies after 20 turns
 struct: it doesnt die every time
 PROJECT_ATAY: and the gold boss has some random aspect to it play in same condition doesn't result in the same output xD
 Dapps: took me awhile to realize that.. kept thinking i had a bug in my code lol
 Dapps: who writes a nondeterministic bot?!
 burnpanck: I would
 struct: all my bots are, except this one
 PROJECT_ATAY: now i don't know what to do no more xD
 Dapps: so for same inputs it has different outputs?
 Djellowman: i never write nondeterministic algo's. makes it harder to reproduce &amp; debug
 PROJECT_ATAY: imma rewrite the attack strats prolly
 Djellowman: i can't figure out how to position a defender
 Djellowman: if they are in the corner of the base, they wont kill enemies on time, but if they are in the border, enemy heroes can blow monsters past you
 Dapps: or you just go all out attack and kill them faster
 Djellowman: how do i know the rank of a boss in arena leaderboard?
 struct: press leaderboard on the left side of ide
 Djellowman: @Dapps that's what i was going for, but with 2 attackers. strat isnt refined enough yet. they try to double cast wind monsters into enemy base, and control monsters towards enemy base
 Djellowman: struct then it just lists Boss at the top
 struct: because all the players that went above it are in legend
 Djellowman: im still is bronze lol
 Djellowman: just started
 struct: ah ok
 struct: then silver
 struct: sry :p
 avdg: me doing math and it's rusty
 Djellowman: ok so you have to finish above rank 1 of your league?
 struct: just above the boss
 Djellowman: but the boss is listed at the top...
 struct: Sometimes boss is at rank 10 if players are still submiting
 burnpanck: think of it this way; the bronze boss is currently at the overall rank ~4000; that is what you need to achieve. because you  are in bronze, you will only be pitted against other bronze players, which are even further - so you do have to beat the majority of your competitors in bronze to advance. you don't have to reach the top of the overall leaderboard however
 burnpanck: I am going to give up - I fear I just wasted many hours writing my full-sim NN-driven MCTS player, and I'm finally ready to start training the NN.But the code does not compile within the time-limit (it takes about 10s on my local machine).
 actualCoderTrevor: This is the first time I've tried to apply NN to a contest. It seems like a difficult case for NN, but that could just be my inexperience talking.
 burnpanck: indeed - I successfully applied it to the last spring contest (though not during the actual contest)
 burnpanck: here, I tried to combine heuristics with NN; heuristics propose actions as well as features describing those actions, and the NN rates them.
 actualCoderTrevor: To some extent I think you have to do that. Like how can a NN know to cast a spell at the correct id without some organization of the inputs and outputs?How is your approach working out burnpanck?
 Djellowman: i still don't understand how to see if i almost won the arena or not
 actualCoderTrevor: The best I've come up with is making all of my heroes walk to the enemy base. I'm working on a major overhaul now to add a bunch of features.
 actualCoderTrevor: Djellowman If you're listed above the boss and have beaten the boss at least once, I'm pretty sure you get promoted after a certain period of time.
 burnpanck: to be honest, I haven't even started training the NN yet - I just finished the player and wanted to check how many layers would fit into the remaining 30 kB I have - but I have absolutely nothing to put up against the compile-time limit
 avdg: all you can do is pretrain and maybe add some comments how your nn is trained
 avdg: just so the moderators are up to date
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh right, you said you were giving up; I thought that was someone else. My bad.
 avdg: I guess generating the magic numbers for the nn is great engineering
 avdg: not by definition hiding code
 avdg: but meh, it's edgy on the rules
 actualCoderTrevor: Yeah I was asking about that earlier
 actualCoderTrevor: Since I have to use base64 and zlib for my weights to fit
 burnpanck: I use base85, and compression of the float exponents, but no zlib
 actualCoderTrevor: I was told it "probably isn't an issue unless you're in one of the prize tiers." Or something to that effect. Which isn't super comforting but if I'm honest, not remotely an issue for me&#160;:(
 avdg: if you document the process, it's hard to believe you cheated
 actualCoderTrevor: That's true
 But_Why: In move 106 Why did the boss wind him only&#160;? it does not make sence .    <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/628870212">https://www.codingame.com/replay/628870212</a>
 avdg: just create your own block chain and link it with irreversible facts :D
 actualCoderTrevor: Easy-peezy
 burnpanck: nah these small NNs are not actually hard to train, my current bot at spring-contest 2021 took just a few hours to train. if they don't believe I'll do a special training just for them&#160;:-)
 avdg: these nn are without reinforced learning I guess?
 avdg: so meaning, they update when they are used
 actualCoderTrevor: But_Why it ends up scoring so I guess it was smart enough to foresee that somehow
 slazure: hi
 avdg: hi
 burnpanck: avdg absolutely, there is no gradient descent in the code that runs in the Arena - I have trouble enough to fit the code for the forward pass into the 100 kB
 actualCoderTrevor: avdg I can only speak to the way mine works, but it works very poorly. But mine is just randomly changing a small percentage of weights on each offline run and hoping for the best. Each run saves its own weights to a randomly-named file.
 But_Why: actualCoderTrevor  it landed before in some cases still it pushes only the monster
 actualCoderTrevor: I modified brutaltester to keep track of which variation is the best and wrote another script to package up the best weights for an arena version of my code.
 avdg: hmm sadly I can't get the referee working because of log4j errors
 actualCoderTrevor: But_Why oh you're right I didn't notice that; it doesn't push the hero.
 actualCoderTrevor: avdg I had a couple of errors that I was able to work around, want some help?
 actualCoderTrevor: (If I remember what I had to do)
 avdg: hmm, I would find it fairer if everybody knew how to compile tbh
 actualCoderTrevor: There was one issue with the referee and a different issue with cg-brutaltester itself.
 Counterbalance: i'm having no problems with it.. what error are you getting?
 avdg: I got a warning and java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
 actualCoderTrevor: avdg yes for sure. I was just in a hurry to get it working and wasn't sure how typical my problems were
 avdg: from the referee that is added in the markdown of cg-brutaltester
 Counterbalance: maybe you need to run using an older jdk/jre
 avdg: might it be maven, because that is running on oracle's java
 Counterbalance: jdk 1.8 or 1.11
 avdg: maven uses an other java version than the one that gets run when I type java
 avdg: which is openjdk even
 Counterbalance: get adopt openjdk 11 and uninstall the rest
 Djellowman: is there some way to only show one player's vision on the gui?
 actualCoderTrevor: Uninstall the rest? :scream:
 Counterbalance: the other jdk/jre versions i mean&#160;;)
 avdg: maven runs on jdk 14
 actualCoderTrevor: Djellowman I think you can do it with the debug settings for fog of war
 avdg: I guess I edit JAVA_HOME
 actualCoderTrevor: avdg You might be having a different issue than I was (can't remember), but I just remembered how I got the referee to work: copying log4j.properties from src/test/resources to src/main/resources.
 actualCoderTrevor: And it looks like I'm using jdk 1.8
 avdg: I have openjdk 16
 Counterbalance: it does build correctly, right?
 avdg: yeah, the referee does, after adding the log4j config file
 Djellowman: actualCoderTrevor where can i find this info? dont see it in the docs
 Counterbalance: I don't think the cg framework runs on anything newer than 1.11
 struct: For cg stuff I use jdk-8u291
 struct: Never had problems
 avdg: uh I hate installing clustered versions of java...
 avdg: mvn seems to ignore JAVA_HOME
 struct: did you set it up correctly?
 avdg: mvn runs, but on older java
 avdg: hmm running brutaltester it<i>s stuck on finding ts-node</i>
 avdg: find it weird that typing ts-node works in powershell, but Get-Alias ts-node fails
 Counterbalance: try a normal shell
 actualCoderTrevor: Djellowman you mean how did I know to copy that file? Couldn't tell you. Just a combination of googling and intuition. A lot of this is new for me.
 Djellowman: no i was referring to the fog debugging
 actualCoderTrevor: Ohhhh yeah I don't remember - I think I learned that from someone here
 maras: Wait, did I get it right, you guys are running a NN without training it beforehand?
 actualCoderTrevor: Well I'm training it with brutaltester, but not using backpropogation, just random mutation
 actualCoderTrevor: and getting abysmal results so far
 maras: Ah, I see
 actualCoderTrevor: If I had like two weeks more, I might try to make a client that would let me direct it with how I think it should play and use backprop to train it
 maras: Did you try normal backprop with some self-play though? Random mutation for even small weights seems very hard to pull off
 actualCoderTrevor: I haven't tried because I can't think of a way to pull it off. But I'm open to ideas&#160;:)
 actualCoderTrevor: It would be easier with say, the Spring 2021 challenge where you can sim some different outcomes in the future and have an idea of what's objectively higher-scoring. Don't know how to achieve the same results with this one though.
 maras: I'd probably play some games offline, scrap their data to some file and run the NN in PyTorch or Tensorflow. Then you also probably need to rewrite the architecture to some other language. But there's a lot to do, not sure if you're able to do everything on the spot during the competition.
 actualCoderTrevor: right
 maras: And then you need to compress the weights with some awful chinese symbols encodings XD
 actualCoderTrevor: lol
 actualCoderTrevor: I'm using base64 and zlib to compress the weights now but I'm sure there's better ways
 actualCoderTrevor: And it's kinda moot when my bot is too dumb to beat the starter code.
 maras: From what I've heard, the CodinGame actually counts symbols, not bytes, so using symbols in that have more than 1 byte let's you fit more data&#160;;)
 actualCoderTrevor: :open_mouth:
 jzen: Does anyone know what the limit is for memory usage? I can't seem to find it anywhere
 struct: 768MB
 jzen: Thank you
 Djellowman: so machine learning approaches even outperform handcrafted bots in this game?
 Djellowman: do*
 actualCoderTrevor: CG contests in general or this one in particular?
 Djellowman: this one
 Djellowman: unless they are all similar. i havent done any others
 actualCoderTrevor: I haven't heard anyone bragging about their awesome ML bots this time but that doesn't mean nobody has one.
 struct: I dont think you will see many
 struct: Last time the winner was a NN
 actualCoderTrevor: In general, many of the top contestants employ some kind of ML, but not all of them.
 struct: but that is not the norm
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh do heuristics tend to fair better? I may have had the wrong impression.
 maras: This game seems much harder than the previous challange though. Almost non-discrete actions, etc
 HoriMiyamura: well I replay in same condition but the boss behavior is different&#160;:(
 maras: But I wouldn't be surprised to see ReCurse skyrocketing with his NN tomorrow
 INIT_TOKEN: Your behavior affects boss's behavior @Hori
 INIT_TOKEN: If you change ur behavior expect boss behavior to change
 Djellowman: is there any way to check if a monster is half hp?
 Djellowman: or to determine which kind of monster it is
 Djellowman: or like, how much hp the regular monsters start with?
 Ayza: The hp a monster starts with is random but you can keep track of every monster's hp by their id and the health variable you are given at the start
 Ayza: so e.g. monsters[id] = health
 Djellowman: that's a bit annoying... will every monster have a unique id? then i can just store them in a dict
 Ayza: yeah the ids are unique
 maras: Instead of fixing a minor bug I introduced one that breaks my entire AI completely. Nice
 jellyfishcoder: lol
 maras: And it still somehow got 250th place in the gold league
 maras: lol
 Dapps: sometimes my bugs gain me ranks lol
 Djellowman: i'm getting: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 Djellowman: but i didn't change anything, parsing wize
 maras: Yeah, same here, I wanted to cast shield every time my opponent abuses control on my guys. I messed up and my heroes weren't casting shields at all. And it turned out to be beneficial...
 maras: @Djellowman, you probably printed too much commands on one turn I guess
 maras: Then the last one counts as it was printed in the next turn
 Djellowman: that would be a very weird error message if that was the case
 Djellowman: its about input reading right
 maras: not necessarily, if your output skips to the next turn, you print it before reading the input and the message is displayed
 HoriMiyamura: so that's mean you print redundant comand
 maras: yeah, most likely
 maras: or you've managed to bug the input reading code&#160;;)
 Djellowman: indeed, i printed an extra line
 alexwastaken: hello 
 alexwastaken: I am new to coding 
 Thorcode: hi alexwastaken
 alexwastaken: hello
 Zerfa: is there any way to test a game without debug enabled outside of submitting the arena?
 maras: offline by downloading the game's source from github I guess
 pmor: can also unit test and write your own sim code
 Djellowman: if only 1 person is listed above the boss, are they the only to promote?
 Djellowman: if i end an arena in like 28th place, do i have to do better..?
 maras: yep
 maras: or you can resubmit and pray for luck
 Djellowman: so only 1 person gets promoted?
 maras: You need to be above the boss to get promoted, yes
 maras: Sometimes more than one person is above
 Djellowman: seems like it is a lot harder to promote now than it was earlier, since the bosses have become much stornger
 maras: The bosses are fixed after  the start of the league I believe
 Djellowman: out of 1000s of bots, only 1 beats the bronze boss? lol
 maras: damn the first guy in the gold is countering me so bad
 Djellowman: now nobody is above the boss...? wtf
 Djellowman: how can i even see my fight with the boss
 maras: He probably got promoted
 maras: or lost with the boss
 Djellowman: when i fight the boss in the IDE, they crash after 20 turns
 maras: lol
 Djellowman: so how can i see why i lost to the boss in arena?
 Djellowman: i don't understand anything about the arena or promotion system. its very confusing and unclear..
 therealbeef: everyone that has managed to rank higher than the boss has been promoted, so obviously there are very few or no players above the boss at any time
 Djellowman: how to see my battle against the boss?
 therealbeef: you only get to battle the bots around you, so you need to reach higher in the ranking to get battles against the boss
 Whiskee: "beating" the boss doesn't mean winning against the boss, just ending up in ladder above it
 Whiskee: you can lose against the boss and still get promoted
 maras: Alright, at the beginning of the contest there are two wood leagues with fixed bots and a bronze league, which is the highest. Then every few days a new league is opened, the best few players get to the next league immediately, the last guy in the league is the previous legue's boss
 Djellowman: i was 2nd place just now. only lost against enemy bots that end with slightly more wild mana
 maras: that's a short summary
 Djellowman: and the boss you fight in the IDE is the same as the one in arena? cause the one in my IDE just crashes
 Djellowman: so i dont understand how it could have a higher winrate in arena
 maras: the entire ladder works like mmr in most of online games, if you beat a player, you get points depending on their relative ranking to you, same with losses
 Djellowman: do you keep increasing mmr by doing multiple arena runs then?
 therealbeef: no, every submit you start from 0
 Djellowman: for instance, i ended up in 4th place in the end of this run. could i be higher next run, or if i didnt beat the boss just now, i wont beat them by resubmitting
 maras: oh, thanks God, ebicochineal got promoted
 Djellowman: &amp; can you see the strat that the boss employs?
 therealbeef: could be higher or lower, there is a bit of random in it
 maras: now I've got a chance
 maras: XD
 maras: I should've went to sleep like 4h ago
 maras: but
 Djellowman: same, but 5 hours
 Djellowman: this stuff is addictive
 maras: 72% games to go and I'm above the boss
 maras: I can't just
 maras: not look at it
 maras: right?
 maras: XD
 Djellowman: can you see the boss fighting somehow?
 maras: you can play against it pretty easily in IDE
 Valtazar: I can't see my heroes fighting
 Djellowman: ah so it is the same
 maras: if your bot gets crashes, you can play it with any other person from bronze
 maras: or whatever league you're in
 Djellowman: i see, i lose because of less wild mana
 Djellowman: but then the boss bot would crash in arena too and just be last place..?
 maras: yeah, that's possible
 maras: pretty funny though
 Djellowman: but nobody is beating the boss in arena, whilst it crashes 100% of the time against me in ide lol
 maras: you've found an exploit maybe XD
 maras: the boss is someone's old AI before the silver was opened, so yeah, it's perfectly possible that it crashes with certain conditions
 maras: alright, it has to be legend now :pray:
 Djellowman: interesting that im one of the few then, otherwise the boss bot wouldnt beat everyone in ranking
 Djellowman: i found a bug it seems
 Djellowman: if a monster is against the fence, then casting WIND on them towards the base will do nothing
 maras: That's actually a feature, kind of
 Lysk: not a bug, outside the base radius it will push the mob out of the map but inside the mob will stay on the edge
 Djellowman: so you have to write edge cases for enemies close to the borders, to do horizontal / vertical wind casts..?
 maras: It's weird, but that's how it works, you can't airbend spider out of the game
 Lysk: you can then block a mob insied a base by spamming wind
 Djellowman: i would've expected them to still be affected for the horizontal component of the pushback
 maras: Yeah, it's the best to calculate the push vector/direction from the mob's perspective
 maras: Then you can avoid the conditions
 Djellowman: meh
 maras: come on, 9%
 maras: I feel bad for Scaff, it seems I'm countering him pretty bad
 Djellowman: i'm already over 200 lines of code. writing all those edge cases is a pain with only 1 file to work with
 maras: hopefully I'm out of the gold soon so he will have a bit easier
 maras: Well, 200 is not that bad&#160;;)
 badradsuperbrad: lol, just 200?? :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 maras: 4% and I can sleep peacefully
 maras: 5:23 AM here
 Djellowman: how is the score calculated?
 struct: It is true skill elo
 Djellowman: badradsuperbrad i started a couple hours ago lol
 badradsuperbrad: yeah, this kept me up until 3am the other day ... got 4 hours of sleep, had to drive 9 hours the next day &gt;&lt;
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill</a>
 struct: so the first 10 matches you see
 maras: finally, good night everyone
 struct: you get a player randomly chosen for each 10%
 struct: 0-10%, 10-20% and so on
 struct: gn maras
 badradsuperbrad: Djellowman lol, nice!  Been at it for a week or so now
 Djellowman: struct thank you
 EvModder: i'm back,... 48hr since last submission and somehow i went from 140th to 4th in gold
 badradsuperbrad: Around 450 lines of rust
 EvModder: idk how it went up without me changing anything
 EvModder: i guess all the people above me got promoted to legend or something
 Djellowman: the arena will keep running &amp; you can check in the morning if you've won right?
 HoriMiyamura: because those above you has gone to legend :D
 EvModder: yeah
 Djellowman: without the browser open
 EvModder: tbh i might just not submit any code tonight to see if a 3-day-old submission can get to legend on it's own XD
 Lysk: nah don't
 EvModder: seems my bot does better the less i touch it
 Lysk: XD
 EvModder: i have some kind of reflection bug rn;
 EvModder: if i have the bottom-right as my base, my bot is 5x more likely to lose
 Djellowman: i've noticed the same with my students
 Djellowman: i've won 100% of battles... why am i not at the top of the rankings
 struct: you should be soon
 Djellowman: yup
 Lysk: EvModder almost
 Djellowman: who would've thunk 1 attacker, 2 defenders is better than 3 defenders
 avdg: what about 1 fixed defender and 1 or 2 interim defenders that are otherwise attackers?
 Djellowman: i lost to 1 person. they kept double blasting enemies into my base
 Djellowman: i've tried to implement that, but wasnt as effective for me
 avdg: submitted a new run with slightly different positioning as a change, only lost 1 so far and guess... a cannon
 avdg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/628943938">https://www.codingame.com/replay/628943938</a>
 avdg: k got my second loss now
 EvModder: same game, but I win if I'm P1 and lose if I'm P2:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/628946563">https://www.codingame.com/replay/628946563</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/628946963">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/628946963</a>
 EvModder: (against Scaff's latest submission)
 EvModder: not sure if their bot is deterministic or not, but if it is then the outcome should be the same regardless of base coordinates
 Djellowman: that sweet 32 trueskill
 avdg: my ai is deterministic, only has 1 "random" element in it, but that is seeded by the game round
 avdg: maybe one should create a randomizer based on game inputs
 struct: What happens if you put your AI vs your AI EvModder?
 EvModder: i use random for optimizing farm moves to hit multiple monsters, but it's also deterministic seeded
 struct: does it tie?
 struct: it should
 EvModder: yes
 EvModder: so far it always ties but i need to do several replays to be sure
 EvModder: i found an exact case where my ai says the spider distance to base is 5018 but the referee thinks it's 5000
 EvModder: does anyone else do what i do and just flip the input x,y,vx,vy when your base is not 0,0?
 EvModder: if(IM_P2){x = MAX_X-x, y = MAX_Y-y, vx = -vx, vy = -vy;}
 EvModder: i feel like the bug might be there but not sure how to handle it
 EvModder: "symmetric truncate"
 struct: EvModder frame 49 to 50
 struct: on one you only have 1 unit shielded
 struct: on other you have 2
 struct: Thats the first different frame
 EvModder: ahh yeah, i was looking at a later frame
 Fallback: if you shield a mob on tick 10, and it gets winded on tick 11, is it protected? or will it get winded?
 EvModder: thanks; i'll plug in some debug
 struct: You will get shielded
 struct: and it wont get winded
 struct: but if it happens on the same turn yuo wil lget winded
 struct: but you will still get the shield on the next turn
 44AA44: cock
 struct: 44AA44 next one will be a ban
 EvModder: struct, the reason i shield in one but not the other is the spider that gets winded out of my base (1 turn earlier) has a different random direction
 EvModder: meaning the difference is coming from something earlier; perhaps the wind command
 EvModder: Oh wait... I see what it is
 EvModder: and i consider it a referee bug 
 EvModder: lol
 EvModder: (output of the referee's RNG is not reflected for P2)
 struct: oh I see
 EvModder: the rand.nextDouble() should be reflected 180 for P2 base IMO
 struct: I guess you could make a post on the forum about it
 struct: I doubt it will get fixed though 
 struct: its weekend and 2 days left
 EvModder: yeah
 EvModder: alr well i'll be back tomorrow... gonna let my 40hr old submission ferment another 9 hrs xD
 EvModder: seems to be a working strat
 struct: me too
 struct: gn
 Fallback: So if a hero is under control currently on tick 10, and you request a spell action to take effect next turn on tick 11. It can still go through but the danger is not being within range to hit your target right?
 struct: I dont think so
 struct: Since control is similar to a move
 struct: I guess it has the same priority
 struct: So it applies after all spells have been cast
 Fallback: let me clarify, you're already under control on tick 10, they casted that before on tick 9
 struct: if you are under control the action would be similar to wait
 struct: You can try to cast a spell but it wont work
 struct: if you cast ed a spell on the turn the also used controlled on you
 Fallback: ok, so it won't burn mana or anything. The only danger might be your own code thinking that you did
 Fallback: thanks
 struct: then it will work
 struct: yeah
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Uljahn: oO
 slamo: Really weird, I had a submission earlier that made it 42nd. I introduced a bug and tried to revert but not a single one of my submissions is coming anywhere close to 42nd anymore
 Sarzorus: When is the contest over? I don't have time this weekend, but I'm considering starting anyways because it's always fun
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2d 3h 39min 30sec
 Sarzorus: Thanks ^
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gtatz EvModder
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er gratz

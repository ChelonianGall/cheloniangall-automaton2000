 jacek: oO
 M0hammed: hi jacek why sleep when u can code right
 M0hammed: tbh lack of sleep is not good tho
 M0hammed: affects concentration too much 
 HenroLST: according to darwin if we all stop sleeping we would evolve past sleeping
 HenroLST: therefore sleeping is for the weak
 eulerscheZahl: or we would get extinct
 HenroLST: psh
 HenroLST: extinction mcextnction 
 HenroLST: if we die then we were weak
 HenroLST: ff im done for the day, bfs beat me today, but tommorrow ill beat it
 waterproofsodium: if you "sleap"
 waterproofsodium: you were weak
 Mengshang: Which the best Visual Studio theme is .
 eulerscheZahl: blue
 eulerscheZahl: the classic one
 eulerscheZahl: light blue
 jacek: :upside_down:
 jacek: Automaton2000 where is my :taco:
 Automaton2000: so it's the same as yours
 iamsofia_rless: hy
 aCat: chat still alive
 aCat: so hello chat&#160;:-)
 BlaiseEbuth: Not for long... But happy caturday
 aCat: as far as this cat knows is sunday&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: Caturday is everyday
 BlaiseEbuth: :cat:
 aCat: ah
 aCat: :D
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/181/604/it_is_written_caturday.jpg">https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/181/604/it_is_written_caturday.jpg</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 aCat: :joy_cat:
 Aldoggen: yay, cat-loving people!
 eulerscheZahl: hey cat, we have a few more days of reprieve for this chat 
 eulerscheZahl: let's hope for the governor's call last minute to stop the execution
 aCat: I really hope for this
 aCat: I mean I use discord normally but rarely for CG and it is not a substitution for CG chat in any moment
 j4at: Yeah, also discord can't replace coc chat.
 eulerscheZahl: admittedly that's an aspect i don't care about personally - but i understand what you mean. you can't easily find the participants of your particular clash on discord and hope they see it in a timely manner
 K4YZ: Hi guys! I am new here to discover CodinGame, what a fun way to practice coding skill :D
 eulerscheZahl: i'm here for 6 years - and the gamified approach with animations still keeps me here
 jacek: startup eh
 K4YZ: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: you have to find that one exception, don't you jacek?
 jacek: i write in java, my code is really exceptional
 eulerscheZahl: just checked: 22 days until my 6th anniversary on CG
 Wishbone: I'll soon have my 1-week anniversary here&#160;:-D
 Westicles: how do you tell how old an account is?
 jacek: by counting the rings
 Westicles: Getting started with CodinGame!  Mar 4, 2017
 Westicles: 5+ years for me
 eulerscheZahl: i checked the age of my forum account
 Aldoggen: I can't find that. is it somewhere in the settings?
 Aldoggen: aah, I found it. I need to expand something when I'm on the page of my forum profile
 Aldoggen: I've been on here for almost two weeks
 martinpapa69: impressive
 Aldoggen: lol
 Aldoggen: not as impressive as teemo's height
 martinpapa69: wow
 martinpapa69: im 69th
 Aldoggen: ok, that's pretty cool
 jacek: oh my
 martinpapa69: ye i need new profile image
 martinpapa69: teemo is boring
 Aldoggen: what about a yin-yang sign that's secretly almost the numbers 6 and 9?

 martinpapa69: oops
 Aldoggen: that's a quick way to flush the chat
 jacek: waku wak
 Aldoggen: Automaton2000 what do you think martinpapa69's new profile pic should be
 Automaton2000: there is no need for mcts
 jacek: oO
 StevenV: Hi Automaton2000,
 Automaton2000: it has the same result
 Aldoggen: Automaton2000 as what?
 Automaton2000: i think there's a bug in your code
 StevenV: how old are you Automaton2000.
 Automaton2000: to find the index of the first action thing still work?
 Aldoggen: Automaton2000 tell me where my bug is please?
 Automaton2000: or do they have a script to merge them
 Aldoggen: not helpful. was worth a try tho
 Aldoggen: Automaton2000 I found my bug! I had a gigantic if-else tree and I forgot a case
 Automaton2000: but this is my first time
 StevenV: I wonder how they code Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: that last bit triggers me, oh well.
 5DN1L: You can check its profile, there's a blog link there, you can read it to learn more
 StevenV: thanks
 5DN1L: np
 Aldoggen: there's also this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/code-your-own-automaton2000-step-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/code-your-own-automaton2000-step-1</a>
 Automaton2000: because you need to check if the opponent is in the top of the leaderboard
 Aldoggen: XD
 StevenV: well...
 Darleanow: i need to confess
 Darleanow: people who code in C are scary
 Floxyii: Anyone that wants to play an escape room?
 StevenV: I need to confess, most of top players use C++ for CG bots
 Darleanow: i'm more comfortable with c++ than c xD
 Darleanow: it is weird right&#160;?
 StevenV: no, I learn C++ from the beginning, and never learn C though
 Darleanow: ok we fine then!
 StevenV: :D
 Darleanow: oh btwi have a question
 Darleanow: we you init an array, you need to give it the size
 Darleanow: or either values to that
 Darleanow: but what if i wanna do an array who's length is growing up
 Darleanow: like in a for loop
 Darleanow: it would be [1] then [1,2] etc
 StevenV: why don't use a linked list for it?
 StevenV: or ArrayList in Java
 Darleanow: can i do something like int arr[**argv]&#160;?
 StevenV: for C++, we can new an Array at run time, so we actually can create a structure like ArrayList in Java
 Darleanow: idk about java&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: linked list and arraylist are hugely different in regards to expected runtime
 Rafarafa: how do I paste a snippet again? pastebin doesn't work atm right?
 eulerscheZahl: pastebin.com
 jacek: for C++ use vector
 Darleanow: (i'd prefer something not so slow, because i work with those values)
 eulerscheZahl: for vector use C++
 Darleanow: i'm using C atm&#160;:)
 StevenV: ah
 StevenV: yes, vector is like arrayList right?
 jacek: then your dead
 jacek: eeyup
 Darleanow: i think that the problem is that i've started with python instead of c or something like this
 Darleanow: ah f***
 eulerscheZahl: nothing wrong with python to get started
 eulerscheZahl: fast progress, keeps motivation high
 jacek: except its dynamic and does stuff for you
 Darleanow: i mean, there is a lot of things that are easier, that's the problem imo
 Darleanow: in C u need to write a lot more
 eulerscheZahl: it has a lot of magic things going on that you won't understand or have to consider
 Darleanow: i'm not really experienced so i might be saying stupid things
 Darleanow: indeed x)
 Rafarafa: alright, this is my solution to the problem 'Treasure Hunt', does someone know why dfs2 doesn't work?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/Rdeuvu4J">https://pastebin.com/Rdeuvu4J</a>
 Rafarafa: (python)
 Rafarafa: the solution works, but not the dfs2 is what I mean
 StevenV: oh, an easy puzzle needs an DFS for it?
 eulerscheZahl: you have one object for visited that you pass in the recursive call for dfs2
 eulerscheZahl: you have to remove it at one point (or make a copy as you did in dfs)
 eulerscheZahl: visited.add(node)result  = gold + max(...)visited.remove(node)return result
 eulerscheZahl: something like this
 Bn_Gaber: can i creat a room to beat with my friends&#160;? 
 Bn_Gaber: compete*
 5DN1L: scroll to the bottom, click START A PRIVATE CLASH
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode</a>
 5DN1L: if you're talking about Clash of Code with your friends
 Bn_Gaber: yes that is what i mean 
 Bn_Gaber: thank you man 
 5DN1L: np
 Rafarafa: wait but then I get a max recursion depth message 
 Rafarafa: since it loops forever with visited = {} no?
 eulerscheZahl: not if you did what i told you to do
 eulerscheZahl: you add the node =&gt; 1 node in the listthen you do the recursive call and add another =&gt; 2 nodes
 eulerscheZahl: then you get more and more until you return from recursion and remove then again one after another
 eulerscheZahl: in the end your visited list will be empty again
 Rafarafa: can't say that I fully understood what you say but it works indeed
 Rafarafa: said*
 Rafarafa: thanks by the way
 eulerscheZahl: just print the list of visited nodes each time. should give you an idea of what's going on
 Rafarafa: :thumbsup:
 martinpapa69: test
 struct: test received
 eulerscheZahl: test completed
 Aldoggen: test eaten
 enamya: test tested
 Darleanow: no teemo pp&#160;:'(
 Aldoggen: nice nice pic tho
 Aldoggen: new*
 martinpapa69: ty, but the thumbnail is still the old one
 martinpapa69: for me at least
 Aldoggen: lmao true
 Aldoggen: for me too
 Aldoggen: chat is really buggy then
 struct: ctrl f5
 Aldoggen: ah
 martinpapa69: nope
 Aldoggen: lol
 Aldoggen: me neither
 martinpapa69: I think the server periodacally updates the thumbnails or something
 Darleanow: has anyone achieved happy-numbers in C
 Darleanow: and if so, in how many lines (just to get an idea) and how about the difficulty of it
 Aldoggen: lemme make it in python real quick and port it to c
 Darleanow: Aldoggen, you can't x)
 Aldoggen: oh wait big numbers
 Darleanow: happy numbers
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/happy-numbers">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/happy-numbers</a>
 Darleanow: i can even give u my code for py one
 Aldoggen: well, python can handle all integers
 Darleanow: but the problem is with the atoi function
 Darleanow: yeah i did it in py
 Darleanow: but u can't convert py to c
 Darleanow: this easily i mean
 Darleanow: you can try if u want
 Aldoggen: I don't think the problem is with atoi. it's with the inherent storage of integers in c
 Aldoggen: idk. were you trying to fit the whole number in an integer, or just one digit?
 Aldoggen: Darleanow do you still need help?
 eulerscheZahl: my c# code for happy numbers has 30 lines, others are in a similar range
 eulerscheZahl: it's more of a math problem than coding
 Aldoggen: yup
 Aldoggen: just did it in 22 lines in python
 Aldoggen: and I didn't use big integers at all
 Aldoggen: kept them as strings
 eulerscheZahl: for an easier one:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=1">https://projecteuler.net/problem=1</a>try to solve it without loops
 Aldoggen: I think Darleanow left a long time ago
 eulerscheZahl: oh, RIP
 Aldoggen: the one you sent is cool!
 Aldoggen: I'm guessing I want to use the gauss formula
 Aldoggen: and then add the multiples of 3 and 5, and subtract the multiples of 15
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Aldoggen: noice&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: I think I did this a few years ago, but with loops
 eulerscheZahl: the add and subtract is called principle of inclusion and exclusion btw
 Aldoggen: aah, size of the union of two sets is the sum of the sizes of the sets, minus the size of the interception&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: I forgot how intricate it became for more than two sets lol
 Aldoggen: okay, back to the happy numbers problem. did you use some kind of array to store the sums of squares of digits?
 Aldoggen: aah, it was c#
 MSmits: yay I finally have my bitboard updating correctly and a nice error print map: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/vuLuv2l">https://imgur.com/a/vuLuv2l</a>
 Aldoggen: noice&#160;:)
 MSmits: making good prints for boardgames is an art unto itself&#160;:)
 MSmits: next up, get the BFS working so i can get out of wood 1 :P
 Aldoggen: that reminds me I have about 5 projects of this site I eventually need to get back to lol
 Aldoggen: I agree about the prints for boardgames
 struct: are you using u128 MSmits?
 MSmits: i am using 64 bit for verticals and 64 bit for horizontals
 MSmits: i never use u128
 struct: you did for hs
 MSmits: yeah, that's when i learned not to :P
 MSmits: GE is a bit misleading, it seems like you have 9x9 squares so it wont fit on 64 bit , but it does
 MSmits: there is no point to placing walls on the outer edges, so i ignore them
 struct: yeah when you said 64 it instantly made sense :p
 MSmits: btw, i kinda do use u128 in my windows forms programs, but it's this weird type called Guid
 eulerscheZahl: what's weird about Guid?
 MSmits: it's weird because it's not intended to be a 128 bit integer
 eulerscheZahl: of course not
 MSmits: it has something to do with web, i dunno
 MSmits: i use it as a 128 bit integer anyways
 eulerscheZahl: it's just a unique identifier. you can use it anywhere, not just web
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: like an integer&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: might be an ID for the database of your website, yes
 MSmits: i guess that is what it was intended for
 eulerscheZahl: basically a random 128 bit number, but with more complex rules to generate it
 MSmits: I use it for persistent dictionary. It is the largest value type, so i dont have to use a struct which is apparently slower
 eulerscheZahl: i think it includes the timestamp of creation and some hardware info of your computer
 eulerscheZahl: struct you are slow
 struct: ik
 eulerscheZahl: struct is a value type in C#. i think MS recommends it for structures up to 8 or 16 byte, something in that range
 pyprog: hello lusers
 pyprog: :innocent:
 Darleanow: is there anything above unsigned long long int&#160;?
 Aldoggen: Darleanow do you still need help with the happy numbers?
 Darleanow: in C&#160;?
 Darleanow: i did it
 Darleanow: i can solve 3 firsyt
 Darleanow: but for the two last ones
 Darleanow: unsigned long long int  x;
 Darleanow: isnt enough
 Aldoggen: the solution is that you need to as many numbers as you can as strings
 Aldoggen: you need to store*
 Aldoggen: so that big number you get in input? store as string. need to compute the squares of digits? convert individual digits to int
 Aldoggen: from then on you can probably store everything as int
 dager12: yall text too much guess why we nerds have no girls
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII :coffee:</b>
 Aldoggen: I can't tabcomplete Automaton2000's name anymore
 Automaton2000: ah i need to look at my code and it shows the script?if so that would be great
 HenroLST: hm
 HenroLST: dager12 you have one?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall need avatars, i always assume blank ones are newbies and ignore msgs
 Aldoggen: my avatar is on my linux partition
 Aldoggen: I haven't found a way to access it without downloading some random program
 Aldoggen: on windows currently
 HenroLST: i have one but doesnt show on chat&#160;:(
 Aldoggen: sad stuff
 Aldoggen: I uploaded my pic
 Aldoggen: gitlab allow you to download it
 Aldoggen: I tried discord first
 Aldoggen: wouldn't work
 Aldoggen: it's only 400x400 pixels tho
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess chat is really going away this week... acording to Thibaud
 Aldoggen: yeah
 Aldoggen: I've been following people I want to keep in touch with 
 Aldoggen: aw you followed me back &lt;3
 China-xyh: I like Clash of Code!
 China-xyh: Ummm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i like seeing what rank people are on bot game start page, don't know much use beyond that, discord names don't match up... well mine doesn't
 Aldoggen: lol
 Aldoggen: yeah I still don't know what to do when chat goes down
 China-xyh: Hee
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I haven't been on CG discord in months, probably tons of chat history with valuable info tho
 China-xyh: Emm
 Aldoggen: and memes
 Aldoggen: today's meme is one about python's help function
 China-xyh: But I can't use discord in China.
 China-xyh: ...
 Ryflyy: how do i code im new
 Aldoggen: the gist of it is: you give very specific instructions to the computer, and then it hopefully does what you meant it to do, instead of what you told it to do
 Aldoggen: I suggest to start out in python3
 Aldoggen: if you don't know what that is, click on my name in chat, and we'll talk in the private chat
 nowfel: @kentonbandy not just you
 aCat: HOLD THE EXECTUTION!
 BlueTaxidermist_737: hello, here's a fun fact for today: visual basic sits proudly at the top with regards to number of keywords with 217 of them being present in the language
 Aldoggen: lmao
 MSmits: nice, simple BFS seems enough to get out of wood for great escape
 Aldoggen: noice lol
 Aldoggen: to bronze, and beyond!
 MSmits: indeed&#160;:)
 wediaklup: bfs?
 Aldoggen: breadth first search
 MSmits: breadth first search
 Aldoggen: apparently you type even slower than I do&#160;:)
 MSmits: well sometimes
 MSmits: I just type carefully so they don't think it's about searching for bread
 Aldoggen: bread first, then jam!
 MSmits: bronze is huge, 1210 players
 Aldoggen: that's a bunch
 MSmits: ranked 352 now, still going up, with simple bfs
 Aldoggen: in cyborg uprising it's 2.7k tho
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: ghost in the cell 
 MSmits: that's what it was called i think
 MSmits: before the great purge
 Aldoggen: are you talking about cyborg uprising?
 MSmits: yes
 Aldoggen: I don't know about the great purge&#160;:)
 MSmits: they renamed a lot of arena's to avoid lawsuits over copyright violation
 Aldoggen: ooh
 Aldoggen: wow yeah
 MSmits: mad pod racing = coders strike back
 MSmits: (star wars reference)
 Nikanameu: and power of thor?
 Aldoggen: lol, I like mad pod racing better though
 MSmits: I think it was still called that?
 Aldoggen: it's a little more descriptive
 MSmits: yeah mad pod racing is ok
 MSmits: we just always called it csb
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's hard AF to find post mortems as it is
 MSmits: so that takes some getting used to
 Aldoggen: thor can probably not be claimed, so it's ok to use
 Aldoggen: oh, because all the post mortems refer to the old names?
 Nikanameu: mean max obvious one
 Aldoggen: oof
 defalt404: yooo this website is ccoooooooooooool
 defalt404: how i didnt know abt this:(
 Aldoggen: I think a lot of people don't
 MSmits: yeah
 Aldoggen: I learned of its existence through reddit of all things
 Aldoggen: I'm currently doing line racing
 MSmits: tron
 Aldoggen: yup
 Aldoggen: it's actually annoying I couldn't find it using that name
 Nikanameu: harry potter flyers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Aldoggen yes, it's great to read what people did on contest when u trying to do multi, can save alot of time.  GitC is still my fav game... er great purge... smh.  CSB is still a good multi to start with tho
 Aldoggen: great purge?
 MSmits: gitc is called cyborg uprising
 PatrickMcGinnisII: An omage to a movie isn't a TM/copyright infringement, I don't really see why they did it
 MSmits: the great purge was what i call the renaming of arena's
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh sorry
 Aldoggen: aah all right
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII i completely agree, they went way too far with it
 MSmits: it's like renaming it was cheaper than checking with a lawyer
 Aldoggen: just to make sure I guess
 MSmits: well a lawyer can make sure too, but this costs money
 Aldoggen: GitC is probably my favourite one too at the moment
 Aldoggen: I've played many games like it in the past. there you had to do the moving yourself of course
 MSmits: I like gitc, but wasn't very good at it
 MSmits: i didnt know what search type to use on finding the best moves
 Aldoggen: so now I'm trying to capture my experience in hard coded commands lol
 Aldoggen: yeah, it's far from evident
 MSmits: I remember getting to silver and then 3 months later getting to gold out of the blue, from someone pushing me over boss
 Aldoggen: whoa how does that happen?
 MSmits: people submit
 MSmits: lose battles to you
 MSmits: you go up in rating
 MSmits: can also go down, but lucky streaks happen
 PatrickMcGinnisII: maybe they were tired of the github repos of Fantastic Bits code ... I dunno.
 Aldoggen: but don't you have to beat the boss yourself?
 MSmits: no, you have to be ranked above the boss
 Aldoggen: aaah
 Nikanameu: which movie is green circle referencing
 Aldoggen: that's how I got to bronze in GitC then
 Aldoggen: I was rank 1, just below the boss at some point
 MSmits: Nikanameu dont think it references a movie. It was made to accomodate a company. Green refers to sustainable energy.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Nikanameu I think it's refereencing the sponsor companies commitment to green tech
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm, i defer to u MSmits
 MSmits: as you should :P
 Aldoggen: pecking order among programmers lol
 MSmits: Aldoggen sometimes you can play perfectly and still not get to the next league on submit
 MSmits: this happened to me in the lower league of dots and boxes
 Aldoggen: it's just luck I guess
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits I been redoing my Galleon Wars code, any recommendations?
 MSmits: no, i havent made a serious bot for that one PatrickMcGinnisII
 MSmits: i think i watched a YT and copied their code
 MSmits: a long time ago
 MSmits: just to get bronze
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have sumbitted on every multi, some good...some bad... revisions are definetely necessary to regain CP i lost on green circle
 PatrickMcGinnisII: omg, MSmits u in wood2...sry
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: thats possible too
 MSmits: i just have a crap bot is all i know
 MSmits: i have a crap bot on some of those ex contests. Mean max too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yep, i submitted crap bot for mean max
 MSmits: I'll get to them at some point
 MSmits: one thing at a time. It's great escape now
 MSmits: kinda like this one
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but i can do better than 1277th in Galleon ...
 MSmits: yeah seems likely
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm great escape, oh yall were talkin bout it earlier
 MSmits: yeah, I am going to try a mcts for it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eww
 MSmits: first version is just bfs. got out of wood for it, now 229/1210 bronze
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think full sim is like 42 depth
 MSmits: 42 depth?
 MSmits: are you talking about branching?
 MSmits: or do you mean random rollout?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 10 walls *2, plus max move distance ... I think the math works out to around 42 depth
 MSmits: i will probably not roll out till end of game. Randomly placing walls seems bad
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i couldn't figure out the eval for depth... 5 to 6
 MSmits: I could just use bfs distance as the end result and backprop that
 MSmits: need to bfs anyway to check noone is blocked
 PatrickMcGinnisII: simple path inserrtions got me to silver...no depth
 MSmits: yeah makes sense
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I know how to pack the wall info into 64 bits, but unpacking into nodelists were too cpu intensive  
 Aldoggen: then you obviously need to perform all calculations on those 64 bits
 struct: MSmits floodfill might work here
 MSmits: how so struct?
 Aldoggen: slash (/) s gives me an error that that command doesn't exists lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my pathfinders are FF
 struct: Yeah floodfill can be used as pathfinder
 struct: basicly you keep doing floodfill to not visited cells and when you reach end
 struct: the iteration of flood will match the distance
 MSmits: that's bfs basically
 MSmits: i got to rank 229 bronze with just bfs
 MSmits: no walls
 struct: nice
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the 9x9 visited map screws up performance
 MSmits: why&#160;?
 Astrobytes: php
 MSmits: 	void SetVisited(int x, int y)	{		visited[y] |= 1 &lt;&lt; x;	}
 MSmits: 	void ResetVisited()	{		memset(visited, 0, 9 * sizeof(int));	}
 MSmits: works fast
 Astrobytes: you don't even need the memset if you do it the counting way
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no memset in php, array setting/copying is not ideal
 MSmits: yeah i know Astrobytes, wasnt any better when i tested though
 aCat: counting way?
 MSmits: yeah you have integers that go up, but you'll need more of them
 MSmits: 81 integers instead of 9
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i saw the counting way on a puzzle reecently, it is fast
 aCat: ah ok, right bet then no bits
 BlaiseEbuth: Oy there. What's the multi?
 MSmits: talking about great escape
 MSmits: I think mainly for the mcts, I need to prune walls to consider
 MSmits: can't consider all 128 wall placements
 BlaiseEbuth: Old things coming back...
 Astrobytes: mcts?
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: interesting approach
 MSmits: why not mcts
 MSmits: i think yurko did it, he's rank 2
 Astrobytes: no, not condemning it or anything :D
 BlaiseEbuth: 2 is not 1
 MSmits: the other one is the contest winner I think
 Aldoggen: 2 is better than bronze
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes: indeed :D
 MSmits: 2 is not 1, but it proves it's a valid approach. I just have to do it better&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Better is better than worse
 Aldoggen: then you'll be rank 2 :p
 MSmits: rating difference is like 0.4 or something, he's probably randomly 2
 MSmits: 0.47
 Aldoggen: ah, still possible to become rank 2 I guess
 Aldoggen: but harder
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i still say MC on GE is kinda yucky, definetely have to direct it with some starting position strategy
 MSmits: mcts you mean?
 MSmits: mc is a different thing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yessum
 MSmits: you can just consider a limited amount of walls
 MSmits: like, walls near your opponent
 MSmits: and near yourself
 Astrobytes: I never finished my GE bot, think its in silver or something
 MSmits: once you coded the mcts, that pruning strategy is all you need to think about
 BlaiseEbuth: Same Astro. Well it was...
 MSmits: astro 971st
 Aldoggen: is it possible to demote?
 Astrobytes: no Aldoggen
 Astrobytes: thankfully
 Astrobytes: ty MSmits
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth&#160;;)
 Aldoggen: all right&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: brb
 struct: maybe add close to the last placed wall MSmits&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: definetely off/def. game ... maybe a 3 depth minmax... and then a mcts on like top 50 leaves . that was what I wanted to try, but never did
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think it's like 27^3 ... which i could do in php\
 martinpapa69: test
 martinpapa69: still old thumbnail wtf
 struct: restart your browser
 struct: idk how it works tbh
 struct: its cached in your browser
 martinpapa69: still
 martinpapa69: ctrl f5 should do the job, its server thing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: chat is on last legs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: GL MSmits, let us know how it goes
 BlaiseEbuth: Nah cach stay even after refresh
 MSmits: will do thanks PatrickMcGinnisII
 martinpapa69: what about ctrl f5&#160;?
 MSmits: and good idea struct
 eulerscheZahl: browser restart doesn't clear your cache unless you changed the default settings. ctrl+f5 sounds much more promising to me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: &lt;alt&gt;+F4 solves my problems
 martinpapa69:&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: I'm implementing a Voronoi-based eval for line racing. I just realized this method will also always try to maximize the amount of moves in case it gets stuck. I like that
 BlaiseEbuth: Another math teacher explode...
 Aldoggen: explode?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. Boom
 Aldoggen: why?
 BlaiseEbuth: Seems the 'Voronoi' people do for line racing is not a Voronoi mathematically speaking. But I don't know exactly, I'm not a math teacher. Proof: I didn't explode
 Aldoggen: XD
 wediaklup: good proof
 Aldoggen: I'm glad I didn't become a math teacher
 Westicles: Another way of saying 'I'm glad I didn't major in math'
 Aldoggen: I did
 Aldoggen: well
 Aldoggen: I'm messing about with the last couple of courses
 struct: I do have a major in math
 struct: maths*
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah that doesn't look  like fun... They don't have the right to make humor, and if they do they mutate into physics teachers... :scream:
 Aldoggen: my math teacher in the last years of high school constantly cracked little math jokes
 Aldoggen: was a civil engineer tho
 Aldoggen: maybe they are allowed
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Starving parrot == polynomial
 Astrobytes: (Polly no-meal)
 Astrobytes: not my 'joke' thankfully
 Aldoggen: an old lady I once knew had a parrot. when she first bought him, he did nothing but curse
 Aldoggen: (this is a joke btw)
 Westicles: maths and sport are the two biggies where US guys will think you have a learning disability or something
 Aldoggen: she tried a lot of stuff, but finally the only thing that worked was putting him in the freezer
 Aldoggen: first couple of seconds he still cursed, but after that it became awfully quiet
 Aldoggen: she opened the fridge, and the parrot shyly stepped out
 Aldoggen: he said "I'm sorry for my behaviour. I'll stop cursing from now on."
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I did rank high on line racing using voroni calc of each direction
 Aldoggen: And followed with "And by the way, may I know what the chickend did to you?"
 MSmits: lol
 putibuzu: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: :D
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: love it
 Aldoggen: punchline is soo good imo
 MSmits: this is like a norm macdonald joke
 Aldoggen: maybe it's his, Idk where it came from
 BlaiseEbuth: Ffs Astrobytes... And ZarthaxX is a cartesian bear who changed its coordinates system.
 Astrobytes: :D
 Westicles: they used to tell poles in the left-hand plane jokes in college but it might offend jacek
 BlaiseEbuth: oO
 Westicles: or maybe it was right :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: Oo
 Aldoggen: BlaiseEbuth love how it's now the other eye that's bigger
 BlaiseEbuth: OO
 Aldoggen: oo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: right hand rule physics jokes can get a bit dirty

 Nikanameu: why are some puzzles giving more XP than others in same category
 struct: Some where made by CG
 struct: non CG puzzles only give 50exp
 Westicles: now YT is going to recommend norm OJ jokes until I erase cookies
 Nikanameu: nintendo 500 shadows 2 750 i dont understand
 struct: shadows 2 has an achievement
 struct: that gives 250exp
 Aldoggen: I was gonna say because they made it the f up
 Aldoggen: but that sounds more plausible
 MSmits: westicles =) they are good oj jokes though
 MSmits: that's my lucky stabbin' cap!
 Westicles: heh heh
 MSmits: he got fired for those actually
 MSmits: producer was a friend of oj's
 MSmits: and he wouldn't stop
 Westicles: that's what they say, but I suspect the Clinton jokes might have been a factor as well
 Westicles: lucky he wasn't killed
 MSmits: yeah. I heard bill clinton killed a guy
 MSmits: (is norm macdonald joke)
 MSmits: he did this on like a morning show too
 eulerscheZahl: isn't he eating babies?
 Aldoggen: why not both!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Told my GF I wasn't gonna get my haircut til I got laid,  my dreadlocks are getting annoying.  I should get a haircut and freak her out, she'll think I'm stepping out on her.  meh.
 Aldoggen: at the same time!
 MSmits: no no, this was way before conspiracy theories were a thing Euler
 MSmits: he was just making fun
 MSmits: on a US morning show
 MSmits: even
 Astrobytes: wasn't it hilary that eats babies? According to the consp. theorists/alt-right
 eulerscheZahl: why not both?
 MSmits: i think a lot of people eat them
 Astrobytes: :D
 Aldoggen: lol
 eulerscheZahl: bill gates too. you can tell by how young he still looks
 Astrobytes: ever seen the movie Dumplings?
 eulerscheZahl: nope, should i put it on my list?
 Astrobytes: Yes!
 MSmits: what kills me about this conspiracy is not even that they think people drink the blood of babies, but that they think it works
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hillary has lost her mind from injecting hormones from glands of fetuses
 Westicles: that bohemian grove thing is for real though
 Astrobytes: Hong Kong horror-ish, but something of a tale of morality
 Astrobytes: every time I make steamed dumplings, I remember it
 Westicles: dress up like owls and worship... something. 
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i always think about ducklings when reading dumplings. and then think "what the hell is he eating?"
 MSmits: so it's like going to church in the woods Westicles?
 Westicles: I don't know, the YT conspiracy guys always say they can't talk about it or they'll get deleted
 Astrobytes: because it's completely false?
 Astrobytes: Or...?
 MSmits: I think you have to be religious for this sort of thing to bother you anyway. Even if they go worship some totem or other it's the same as any other kind of worship to me
 Westicles: It is a pillar of the Conspiracy Iceberg!
 Astrobytes: I bet this owl cosplay stuff is a hoot :P
 MSmits: norm joke!
 MSmits: good one

 Astrobytes: no I know
 Aldoggen: why on earth is there a java.security.KeyStore.Entry in java
 Astrobytes: It's just more fun 
 Aldoggen: it's interfering with map.Entry
 Westicles: Trump or Bernie, either one for the chaos
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: I mean steering wheels are nice and round, they dont object to any one putting hands on them, and you can steer them right.  Also some are fuzzy.
 Aldoggen: extra points if the horn is nice
 Astrobytes: all about that horn
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: (yes, if they are horny)

 Astrobytes: Aldoggen: fair point. She (and I) only ever used it for bioinformatics stuff (both biologists)
 Astrobytes: And I hate bioinformatics
 jacek: i used R in one subject. the guy didnt care, he just graded stuff so it follows gaussian distribution
 Astrobytes: :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: unless u work for the CDC, Rrrrr
 Astrobytes: I don't. What did they do?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: center for disease control, virus R factor... not important
 j4at: why a lot of people use R instead of Python&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: never used R, does it have like high math precision or something?
 Astrobytes: stats-wise it's better and possibly faster
 Aldoggen: many operations are by default vectorized
 Aldoggen: I think
 Aldoggen: it's really made to work with datasets
 jacek: can you make NN in it
 Aldoggen: you can make NN in bf if you want
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can it find ~A matrix solutions for me?
 Astrobytes: yeah for matrix math etc, it's always been top dog in that respect.Python though, with certain math libs and ML libs I'm sure can compete
 Aldoggen: Astrobytes I think I'd hate bioinformatics too, but I know nothing about it
 Aldoggen: python has some nice ml libs last time I heard
 Astrobytes: I just always preferred other people to analyze my data for me and send it back 
 j4at: Python is faster than R unless big vectorizable data. In that case you can use libraries.
 Aldoggen: PatrickMcGinnisII ~A matrix solutions? do you mean matrix inverse? it probably can
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well that's cool at least
 Aldoggen: the * is matrix multiplication by default I think
 Aldoggen: don't remember
 Aldoggen: sounds weird tho
 Aldoggen: ah nope * is just pointwise
 BlaiseEbuth: Why people use a fast and efficient language designed for the task they want to accomplish when they can use a generic purpose and not so good language (euphemysm) to do it? :3
 Aldoggen: wrap it in percent signs to get the matrix operation lol
 Astrobytes: j4at: most things I came across in various bioinformatics depts. were built around frameworks built in C++, with R and python parts
 Astrobytes: for things like RNA microarray data etc
 PatrickMcGinnisII: There's 1 or 2 puzzles on here that will melt your brain if you can't write your own ~A matrix maker
 j4at: python has @ operator for matrix multiplication btw 
 Aldoggen: can you point me to one PatrickMcGinnisII?

 BlaiseEbuth: tron
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Teacher I know lost his job teaching USGS and datasets, then CoV happened ... THEN they needed him ... I don't think he knows R tho
 Astrobytes: any search or even reflex with a heuristic of most squares reachable should be fine for that
 Aldoggen: j4at does it do that by default?
 Aldoggen: yup tron
 jacek: i think its for numpy
 Aldoggen: aah makes sense
 Aldoggen: Astrobytes I'm implementing something using voronoi, but it's basically multiple flood fills at the same time
 Astrobytes: scipy has some handy things too, I mean it's not like python is bad or anything

 Aldoggen: I wonder what was shared more than rickroll
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. What was first?
 Astrobytes:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a> was directly above rickroll
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/445a8582-b07a-41de-b842-b49071b92161">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/445a8582-b07a-41de-b842-b49071b92161</a>
 Aldoggen: I have fond memories of this one. my array wouldn't update or something
 j4at: you cane 
 Astrobytes:&#160;:(
 j4at: you can make @ works with lists you need to overload __matmul__
 j4at: and  use custom lists
 j4at: :p
 Nikanameu: what a weak paste bin it say invalid so weak so weak
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/h2DNqz1i">https://pastebin.com/h2DNqz1i</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: matmul... That sounds like a Gread Old One name...
 Astrobytes: that's all I have, not the full list
 Astrobytes: and not a full extraction either
 Nikanameu: what is that
 j4at: a virus
 j4at: don't open
 Astrobytes: the extracted links from partial chat logs
 Aldoggen: only open once you've overridden the mathmul operator on it
 Nikanameu: jaat weak joke
 Aldoggen: Nikanameu weak level
 Nikanameu: uncle roger reference no personal
 Nikanameu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeKqTbgiRW0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeKqTbgiRW0</a>
 Aldoggen: all right 
 Astrobytes: Nikanameu: default CG pastebin is broken
 j4at: 8th link is self promotion
 Aldoggen: it's thibault probably
 Aldoggen: so it's fine?
 BlaiseEbuth: The JBM Twich is 7th eh.
 Astrobytes: no another thibaud
 Aldoggen: oh wait wow
 Astrobytes: he did a lot of streaming and an unofficial 'contest' too
 Nikanameu: my impersonation maybe weak <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfiraB94xcE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfiraB94xcE</a>
 Astrobytes: so not self-promotion
 Astrobytes: but hey, who cares eh, this will all disappear in a matter of days
 Aldoggen: :cry:
 j4at:&#160;:'(
 j4at: before that
 j4at: guys, follow me in github I will do feet reveal when i reach 3 followers
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Nikanameu: why disappear
 Aldoggen: getting 3 followers would be a feat
 Astrobytes: I give out code on my patreon and only fans
 Aldoggen: is it sit-on-your-keyboard-perl?
 Astrobytes: Nikanameu: they're 86ing the webchat next week
 Astrobytes: Aldoggen: if requested
 Aldoggen: mmmm&#160;;)
 Nikanameu: i don't know what that means
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Nikanameu: they're getting rid of it this coming week
 Aldoggen: the chat will be terminated this week
 Aldoggen: and my voronoi is too slow
 Aldoggen: somehow
 Nikanameu: no more chat why
 Nikanameu: my blender broke today now chat
 Aldoggen: it's too expensive to keep somehow
 Astrobytes: Nikanameu:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/discussions-spaces-update-the-question-of-the-chat/196276/26">https://forum.codingame.com/t/discussions-spaces-update-the-question-of-the-chat/196276/26</a>
 jacek: you think he didnt see that? its pinned
 Astrobytes: :P
 Nikanameu: i have selective reading
 jacek: lysdexia?
 Astrobytes: where do you keep it?
 Aldoggen: dslxyia
 Aldoggen: ah, I forgot an e
 Nikanameu: filtering what i don't need
 Nikanameu: dyslexia bad filtering good
 Astrobytes: sometimes you need to dig deeper.
 Nikanameu: increase tolerance can decrease quality
 j4at: I'm actually a NN created by jacek to increase the quality of the messages in chat, to stop it from being deleted. Now, after I failed my job he decided to terminate me :skull:
 BlaiseEbuth: Oo
 Aldoggen: shouldn't ahve trolled me about @ :p
 Astrobytes: Nikanameu: leave that for the computer, we are more nuanced
 Nikanameu: chat distracting maybe is to increase productivity
 Astrobytes: distraction is not the chats problem, just the user
 jacek: which user
 Astrobytes: you
 jacek:&#160;:(
 Nikanameu: he did nothing wrong
 Astrobytes: ask a silly question...
 HenroLST: j4at :astonished:
 Astrobytes: Nikanameu: this is jacek we are speaking with
 Astrobytes: aka Trollpony Extraordinaire
 Astrobytes: I swear half the reason I will miss this chat is because of jacek
 Nikanameu: no other code site has chat
 Nikanameu: all forum
 j4at: and me&#160;?
 Nikanameu: who?
 Astrobytes: no just jacek :P
 HenroLST: j4at arent you jacek's NN though?
 Nikanameu: that's why i said who
 j4at: Yeah I'm supposed to be better
 Astrobytes: I got that Nikanameu
 j4at: Well, there is no hope I hacked the Russians nuclear warheads. He can't terminate me now, OR I will destroy Australia
 HenroLST: Dang
 HenroLST: not the emu's
 jacek: not the alps
 Astrobytes: Not sure if many would notice, other than the fallout and whatnot
 Aldoggen: those alps are pretty southern suddenly
 Astrobytes: lol right
 j4at: well the spider will try to find a new home
 HenroLST: they teleported
 j4at: so I bet you will all notice
 HenroLST: australian secret
 Nikanameu: war no fun, everyone talking big now we all get ... in trouble, NATO, Russia, China, no matter who right or wrong
 Aldoggen: but since autralia is upside down, the nuke would just fall away into the sky
 Astrobytes: jacek: AustrALIA not Austria
 jacek: :upside_down:
 HenroLST: hmmm
 Astrobytes: Nikanameu: indeed
 Aldoggen: jacek is suddenly australian too
 j4at: Jacek is Australian :o
 HenroLST: Dang
 arfelious: are all players listed as online clashers?
 Astrobytes: Poles apart :rofl:
 Nikanameu: maybe post fallout australia will be written austria to make name shorter
 Aldoggen: think so
 HenroLST: then would austria be ...
 Aldoggen: yep doesn't make sense to me
 j4at: upside down Austria
 Astrobytes: Austria might be just aus at that point
 Aldoggen: I guess
 Astrobytes: (there's a joke in there)
 Aldoggen: could you say ich bin aus aus?
 Aldoggen: or does that not fit,
 Aldoggen:&#160;?*
 Aldoggen: and my flood fill is way too slow lol
 Aldoggen: why is the timeout so short
 Astrobytes: seems legit, euler would be best to confirm that though
 Astrobytes: probably another word used for that
 Aldoggen: google translate says ich komme aus australien
 Aldoggen: so it probably works&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Never mind the time limit, why is your code so slow is the question you need to ask
 j4at: how to e10 in c++&#160;?
 Aldoggen: I know
 Aldoggen: how do people implement flood fill? lol
 Aldoggen: I'm putting strings in twodimensional arraylists
 Aldoggen: that's about it
 jacek: strings in array? :scream:
 Aldoggen: XD
 Aldoggen: strings aren't mutable, so might as well right?
 j4at: well, seems like no uses C++ here
 jacek: double x = e10?
 j4at: e10 deez nuts
 jacek: oO
 HenroLST: magic
 HenroLST: ...
 HenroLST: jacek fix your NN
 Astrobytes: exp(10)?
 Astrobytes: grim joke
 Aldoggen: does just e10 not work?
 Astrobytes: might do
 Nikanameu: when next week is chat dead
 Astrobytes: never tried tbh
 j4at: In python we use 1e10
 Aldoggen: I looked at some random reference. seems like it should work. idk
 Odins_Kin: How am I to start learning things in here if I am unsure of how to play
 Aldoggen: make sure you use python3, have another tab with w3schools open, and try things out
 Aldoggen: I guess
 Odins_Kin: thank you
 Astrobytes: 1e10 should work fine in C++
 Aldoggen: Odins_Kin no problem. if you have specific questions, hit me up in chat. chat will disappear some time next week tho
 Odins_Kin: how do I reach you right now then?
 Aldoggen: I think j4 was just making a dees nuts joke
 Aldoggen: discord I guess?
 Aldoggen: or do private messages still work?
 Astrobytes: Aldoggen: hence my "grim joke"
 Aldoggen: ah
 Astrobytes: no, all messaging will be removed
 Aldoggen: sad
 Aldoggen: well, there is a codingame discord server Odins_Kin
 Astrobytes: can still contact people on the forum, and discord, if you don't know someones discord username just ask
 Astrobytes: someone should know
 Astrobytes: hopefully
 Aldoggen: mine is the same on discord
 Astrobytes: mine is the same middle part of my discord name
 Aldoggen: welp can't find it on the CG server if you're there
 j4at: Humans don't understand comedy, I guess. Alphazero can't stop laughing everytime I tell him a dees nuts joke.
 krishna636: hi guys, I am new here
 krishna636: where should I start from, any suggestions?
 Aldoggen: j4at lol
 j4at: follow this tutorial krishna636 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
 krishna636: bruh..
 Nikanameu: that's why chat dying
 Aldoggen: krishna636 the easy puzzles. if you don't know any programming languages, start with python. w3schools is a useful resource
 Aldoggen: have fun!
 krishna636: thanks Aldoggen
 Nikanameu: i start on atcoder easiest way to learn
 Odins_Kin: Aldoggen what's your for digit tag so I can hit you up in the discord chat 
 Astrobytes: Odins_Kin: join the CG discord
 Astrobytes: You'll find the username easily
 Aldoggen: you can @
 Aldoggen: and start typing my CG name
 Nikanameu: this chat so many memories i don't have&#160;:'(
 Aldoggen: i'm wondering whether the CG discord will liven up once this chat dies out 
 Aldoggen: hey Nikanameu, I started two weeks ago. I missed almost all of it
 Aldoggen: still, I already have some nice memories&#160;:)
 Nikanameu: i started during contest
 Astrobytes: If we make it so I guess, but so many people will not or can not move to discord
 Nikanameu: looked ugly so i went away
 Aldoggen: the green circle? yep
 Astrobytes: the last contest Nikanameu?
 Nikanameu: yes sorry
 jacek: best contest ever eh
 Astrobytes: it was... a difficult contest
 Astrobytes: jacek :D
 Aldoggen: I looked at the rules, and went to do something else
 jacek: so difficult i havent bothered reading the rules
 Astrobytes: the statement was kinda off
 Aldoggen: miss me with that flying s
 Nikanameu: i read your forum post jacek you did good
 Astrobytes: he certainly did&#160;:)
 Nikanameu: are you doing any other contest site jhacek
 Aldoggen: I still find it funny he didn't read the rules and just crammed the inputs into... was it NN? dont' remember
 Astrobytes: yeah, deep Q-learning 
 jacek: no. i rarely do contests for real. this one worked
 Aldoggen: aah
 Nikanameu: talent
 Astrobytes: have you seen jaceks board game rankings on here?
 Astrobytes: most of those are utilising NN
 Nikanameu: i see complain no ML support
 jacek: you make your own ML with blackjack and hookers
 j4at: yeah, jacek was just lucky
 Nikanameu: and you?
 Astrobytes: it takes a little bit of manipulation to fit these things into CG-palatable input but it can be done
 j4at: I didn't want to participate to give you a chance
 Astrobytes: (he failed and gave up too early :D )
 Aldoggen: after all, j4at is the better version of jacek
 j4at: Yeah they should increase chars limit  from 100k to 1m 
 Astrobytes: that's what clever encoding is for
 Aldoggen: what limit?
 j4at: Well, someone write a library bc I'm not clever enough
 Astrobytes: there are scripts
 Aldoggen: oh, code in the IDE?
 Nikanameu: MCTS always works
 Astrobytes: if you look in the chat logs I think robo shared some nice stuff, or just ask jacek or whoever
 j4at: send links I'm not clever enough to use google
 Nikanameu: others train bot on MCTS makes it better faster stronger
 Nikanameu: jacek share nice stuff
 GVART96: Hey guys is there a way to integrate codeingames with some of Jetbrains IDEs?
 Astrobytes: you can use cg sync or cg local plugins (browser)
 Astrobytes: they sync with the file you work on, so IDE independent
 PiterYeh: did CG kill shortest CoC?
 Astrobytes: updates in the CG IDE
 GVART96: gonna try, ty
 PiterYeh: i logged on to play "just one" shortest... but it's been 50 minutes :D
 Astrobytes: no, still a thing afaik
 Nikanameu: next week biggest CERN experiment maybe chat gone anyway
 PiterYeh: aight... back in the queue i guess
 j4at: I have 12.5 m NN. I will give whoever can fit it in CG. the secrets to survive CERN experiments
 jacek: use black hole to fit your NN into several bytes
 jacek: kurisu made it
 HenroLST: ...
 j4at: Well, the closest black hole is 1000 light years.
 Astrobytes: OR IS IT
 jacek: youre not weeb enough
 j4at: oh steins gate
 jacek: :tada:
 struct: just make smaller NNs
 Astrobytes: OR CAN YOU?
 j4at: ladies likes it big tho
 Astrobytes: OR DO THEY?
 j4at: like*
 Nikanameu: smaller like 1 layer perceptron no learning
 Astrobytes: OR IS IT?
 jacek: most my NNs have mostly 1 hidden layer, at most 2
 Astrobytes: OR DO THEY?
 j4at: MLP KEK
 Astrobytes: Lack of Gumball appreciation here is sad
 Nikanameu: all recent study show bigger is where it is at
 Nikanameu: increase gpt 3 to 10x and it will look like sentient being
 j4at: That's for transformers which what i'm using normally&#160;:)
 j4at: But stopped bc of CG&#160;:(
 Nikanameu: lies you wasn't in contest
 j4at: Huh&#160;?
 struct: my SR NN is 15k chars
 Astrobytes: OR IS IT
 j4at: I'm 24th in the hardest contest. 
 j4at: Search race how dare you inult me 
 j4at: jk :p
 Astrobytes: Or are you? Or did it?!

 j4at: Jacek you don't use GPU to train&#160;?
 jacek: im too dumb
 Aldoggen: lol
 j4at: Well, we all dumb that's why we should use frameworks&#160;:)
 Nikanameu: nvidia cuda cores all you need to know
 j4at: Kaggle offers free GPU servers&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: or write your own around existing libs
 j4at: tensor cores&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: quantum tensor cuda hyper-omega cores
 Aldoggen: I forgot to add 2000
 Astrobytes: Quores
 Astrobytes: (that might be a thing, I don't know)
 Nikanameu: 30 hour gpu but kaggle contest need all week
 j4at: My dude destroying us using only CPU. And I'm here renting RTX 3090 servers
 jacek: going green
 j4at: GPU are more green because a lot faster
 j4at: RTX 3090 is not the most green GPU tho
 Nikanameu: then why bitcoin sanctions
 j4at: but I use my GTX 1080 normally
 Astrobytes: depends on power consumption not speed
 jacek: you went full green in last contest so you should be 1st
 Nikanameu: and LHR limitations on anything lower than 3090&#160;?
 Aldoggen: Astrobytes quores sounds too much like chores
 Astrobytes: Aldoggen: lol fair point
 j4at: Astrobytes it depends on powerconsumption/speed -_-
 Astrobytes: naturally, but power consumption is usually higher for people using higher powered gpus because they leave them running far longer
 j4at: GPUS are like x100 faster than CPUS
 Astrobytes: no shit
 j4at: so yeah gpus are more green
 j4at: I should have gotten the first place&#160;:)
 Nikanameu: then get fast car it uses almost no fuel because it goes fast
 Nikanameu: no work like that
 Astrobytes: lets get into production of gpus shall we? Soooooo green
 j4at: bruh you can train the nn in 1 minutes instead of an hour
 Nikanameu: you think small
 j4at: GPUS are totally worth it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Sure. But don't call it green.
 MRBlack01: hi for all
 MRBlack01: new user
 MRBlack01: here
 j4at: GPUS &gt; CPUS&#160;:)
 Nikanameu: j4at playing a prank nobody using gpu 1 minute
 j4at: ofc no one uses a gpu for 1 minute
 Nikanameu: why you think stronger computer need better power supply
 Astrobytes: I'll just let that play out
 j4at: Check supercomputers that uses cpus powerusage compared to GPU super computers 
 struct: so GPUs beat CPUs on everything?
 Nikanameu: ok you solved world power problem if everyone uses super power consuming devices we use less electricity
 j4at: struct nope
 j4at: CPUS are smarter and offer less delay
 Astrobytes: just more environmentally friendly :rofl:
 j4at: GPUS are more environmentally friendly.
 j4at: Imagine If OpenAI uses 50K CPU instead of 500 GPU
 struct: well you are saying for NNs
 j4at: imagine if miners still use cpus
 Nikanameu: maybe you are onto something Quantum computers are magnitudes faster so maybe they can slow down consumption
 j4at: because they started with cpus
 j4at: they woudl use a lot mroe power
 Nikanameu: miners do it all day
 Nikanameu: nobody limits their income omg
 Astrobytes: in the short term vs CPU of course they are more green and efficient, but that isn't how they are used, they are used CONSTANTLY
 Astrobytes: don't see people doing that with CPUs because it's stupid
 j4at: THey don't do it with CPUS because CPUS are slow
 j4at: THey used to tho
 Astrobytes: you are so missing the point
 j4at: In ancient days of bitcoin
 j4at: they used cpus
 jacek: this is the most green <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html">http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html</a>
 struct: my bike is faster than my car and its more green
 struct: but when it rains I get wet
 Astrobytes: anyway, I'm out for tonight.Hopefully chat is still here for us to argue tomorrow :D
 Nikanameu: they used pen and paper <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html">http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html</a> 
 Nikanameu: ok i am too slow
 jacek: slowpoke
 struct: and cuda programming is not trivial
 Nikanameu: jacek mining with his pen and paper right now has link open all the time
 Nikanameu: better chat gone than argue this
 Nikanameu: i need use my time better omg j4at
 jacek: welp you dont need cuda with tensorflow or pytorch
 Aldoggen: Astrobytes gn!
 j4at: pen and paper are not energy efficient don't do it Nikanameu
 Nikanameu: does it make you emit green gases?
 j4at: yeah you fart a lot when you do cryptography.
 Aldoggen: you fart green gases O.o
 Aldoggen:&#160;?*
 j4at: yeah&#160;:)
 j4at: Also paper is made of wood
 Aldoggen: I wanna see that 
 Aldoggen: I thought it was the other way around
 Aldoggen: we throw away paper and trees grow out of it
 j4at: You didn't watch cartoons&#160;? Theirs farts is always green
 Aldoggen: I've seen white ones too
 Aldoggen: I think
 Nikanameu: burning 40 years consecutively how you stop climate change? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/giant-hole-ground-has-been-fire-more-40-years-180951247/">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/giant-hole-ground-has-been-fire-more-40-years-180951247/</a>
 Aldoggen: lol more than half the easy puzzles I've done were to help other people
 j4at: THe should rename wood league in green circle
 j4at: they*
 Aldoggen: to paper league?
 Aldoggen: sounds good
 j4at: no, to tree league
 Aldoggen: sounds fun when you're in tree three league
 Aldoggen: all right I'm off for the night
 Aldoggen: gn!
 struct: gn

 B00M3RiNGU3: jesus lord, why couldn't this site just have videos to teach us
 B00M3RiNGU3: *?
 Damaxal: what should they teach you?
 B00M3RiNGU3: like, is there a way to learn where goes what and why it goes there without having to look it up on external sites?
 Westicles: teach you not to blaspheme!
 mzbear: programming always involves having to look things up from external resources
 B00M3RiNGU3: then what's the point of this site being here if itself is supposed to be an "external source"?
 B00M3RiNGU3: seems kinda counterintuitive
 mzbear: you work on the puzzles here, learning by doing, and the site verifies your answers.  it's quite nice, really
 B00M3RiNGU3: it's legit just throwing me into a pit and expecting me to know how to climb out after having me input one number
 B00M3RiNGU3: havent found one puzzle yet that is explanatory or easy to understand
 mzbear: well, why aren't you climbing? :D
 mzbear: try writing some code, see what you can do with the input you got
 mzbear: it doesn't have to work the first try
 mzbear: the important part is being able to see what your code does
 Westicles: the world needs fry cooks as well
 B00M3RiNGU3: can yall read?
 B00M3RiNGU3: its not knowing where stuff goes and why it goes there that it needs to teach someone like me
 darkhorse64: This site is not about teaching, it is about competitive programming. You will learn something by programming puzzles or bots but it will not give you the basics. 
 mzbear: everything's difficult in the beginning.  it'll get easier once you get started
 situu: yep
 mzbear: if you haven't decided on a programming language, i recommend python 3.  then google some resources about "conditions" and "loops" in python 3 to get started.
 mzbear: and start with this puzzle: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1</a>
 situu: but if u want to master game development i recommend lua
 mzbear: any language is fine, as long as you can find resources that teach you the basics about it
 mzbear: anyway, that Thor puzzle is quite easy. It only requires you to know variables and conditions.
 situu: I couldn't see the video tho
 situu: so i died multiple times
 mzbear: oh wow, didn't know intel had such useful interactive guide for their special instruction sets:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#cats=Bit%20Manipulation">https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#cats=Bit%20Manipulation</a>

 jacek: :thinking:
 JKROwling:                1300135
 mzbear: oh, it spells out "boobs"
 situu: what's with the numbers
 mzbear: 13 = B ... that's with the numbers.  it's a highly intellectual joke

 Astrobytes: wtf
 NorwegianMori: hello from the other side
 JKROwling: 5130013
 struct: enough with the spam
 JKROwling: how to become a moderator?
 JKROwling: what is the criteria?
 Astrobytes: Can see where that was headed
 mzbear: not spamming "boobs" is a good start
 Astrobytes: hey, that got me my moderator status
 MSmits: thats how i did not&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: :D
 mzbear: alright, second iteration of Yavalath bot done. still no search, but now i'm taking forced moves too
 mzbear: seems to do a bit better than pure random
 Astrobytes: oh your doing yava, nice&#160;:)
 situu: right about to solve Futoshiki Solver
 Aayush.Curious: oh..puzz of week
 MSmits: yeah, nice one mzbear
 MSmits: would be cool to have more players
 MSmits: btw, get your steals set up correctly. Steal all center squares. dont steal the corners and the mid  hexes on the edges
 MSmits: (center = 7 hexes)
 mzbear: i've kinda started preparations for making search, by optimizing the heuristics as much as possible
 mzbear: i'm only stealing centers currently, since i have no idea what moves are good moves yet
 MSmits: well basically i just told you&#160;:)
 MSmits: corners and mid edges are bad
 MSmits: centers are good, so steal. Rest is pretty balanced
 MSmits: I simulated around 4 million games, so I'm fairly confident&#160;:)
 mzbear: wait, all 7 center hexes are good? mmkay
 MSmits: yeah i solved them as awin
 MSmits: so you can technically always win if you take them
 MSmits: you do have to have a good bot of course, but it should increase your win chances at the very least
 mzbear: alrighty then, i'll write down a TODO comment and do that a bit later, right now the stealing is a hack and i need to rearchitecture the code first :D
 MSmits: sure, if you want to get a good bot fairly quickly, probably go minimax
 MSmits: it's not worse than mcts
 MSmits: and much easier to code
 mzbear: mcts isn't that hard either, it's just more annoying to tune
 MSmits: it's reasonably difficult here
 struct: on yavalath is harder
 MSmits: because fully random rollouts dont work
 mzbear: my biggest problem is that i dont feel like setting up a local testing environment
 MSmits: if you random rollout, almost every game ends because someone suicides with a 3 in a row
 mzbear: so i'm coding in this web editor ... and my display is fairly small, so that code editor is 60x25 characters large only :D
 MSmits: eek
 mzbear: i already have fairly fast heuristics to prevent 3 in a row etc
 MSmits: yeah, if you put those in the rollout, it should do ok
 MSmits: also try to take the win automatically in the rollout
 struct: are you doing bitboards mzbear?
 mzbear: i go through all 61 moves in ~0.015ms currently, testing for 3-in row and 4-in-row
 mzbear: yep, bitboards in BMI2
 MSmits: you mean you use intrinsics
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MSmits: I would guess pdep, pext, pop count and ctz/clz
 mzbear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7707c253-909f-4fbf-aba9-9a8fee6e07c2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7707c253-909f-4fbf-aba9-9a8fee6e07c2</a>
 mzbear: there's an example
 MSmits: well close enough, thats 3 out of 5 guessed right&#160;:)
 mzbear: i do use popcounts for other tests
 MSmits: ah ok, yeah you kinda need it to generate a random number
 MSmits: btw, if you go further into it, it can be worth checking for traps
 mzbear: oh hey, i didn't even think of that yet
 mzbear: popcount + pdep to pick a move, yes yes yes
 MSmits: but ofc first just get something working&#160;:)
 MSmits: this sort of thing is very bug prone, small steps
 mzbear: right now i'm just looping through all moves and doing reservoir sampling
 MSmits: whats reservoir sampling
 mzbear: if(rand()%n++==0) 
 MSmits: no idea what that does
 mzbear: so i dont need to store the moves anywhere, i just iterate through them all
 MSmits: randomlu?
 MSmits: u=y?
 MSmits: seems weird to iterate over all and yet use random
 mzbear: well, that provides an uniform distribution
 MSmits: ohh right
 MSmits: this is monte carlo
 mzbear: except without search
 MSmits: good way to start
 mzbear: :D
 MSmits: it's kind of a search
 MSmits: it's MC search
 mzbear: well, kind of.  i just discard bad moves and pick decisive moves, otherwise it's random
 MSmits: ah ok
 mzbear: since i dont evaluate any future states yet
 MSmits: big difference between this game and uttt is the early ended games
 MSmits: if I do a mcts and i get to ply 10 or so, often 80% of nodes are immediately solved
 mzbear: it would probably be more efficient to do the 4-in-row and 3-in-row tests after mutating the board
 MSmits: because they fail to block some trap
 JKROwling: :O
 mzbear: looks like i got rank 50 with this
 MSmits: over halfway up the ladder
 struct: fish is the highest minimax right?
 MSmits: tric trac
 MSmits: but basically just as good
 MSmits: the only reason tric trac is up there is probably because i got dafish's tree solved better
 MSmits: also
 MSmits: dafish both experiments more with bad moves
 MSmits: bot
 MSmits: tric trac has a tiny opening book i think
 MSmits: there's also a neural network
 MSmits: rob
 MSmits: +o
 struct: is it strong?
 MSmits: he thinks he failed, but it actually makes good moves
 MSmits: its just super deterministic
 MSmits: I had to work pretty hard to find the correct counters
 MSmits: maybe jace k can make a better NN or his ntuple bot, he always uses random so that will be interesting&#160;:)
 MSmits: anyway have to walk the dog, ttyl&#160;:)
 struct: cya
 Westicles: struct, if you get control again you should change it to octagons.  kill 2000 hours of work for him&#160;:)
 Westicles: well, of course octagons don't tile...
 mzbear: change it to penrose tiling
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: he could also just remove the center hex
 MSmits: that would do the job as well
 MSmits: maybe put a volcano there and call it Lavayath (trademark Astrobytes)
 hbq123-boop: devalaya patlayam
 hbq123-boop: is nice
 situu: anyone finish the clash of code??
 jacek: still working on that n-tuples. quick testings show 65% winrate against the mcts
 MSmits: nice
 jacek: actually i tried mlp n-tuples. with fixed nodes it is better but too slow
 MSmits: what is mlp again?
 darkhorse64: all 4 n-tuples for Y&#160;? Using symmetry&#160;? Yes, I read all your references papers and I think I could write one now. The training part is less clear in my mind
 jacek: multi-layer perceptron MSmits
 MSmits: ahh yes
 jacek: yeah, i use all 4-in-rows
 MSmits: funny thing is, i have a bot thats all set up to do that
 jacek: no symmetries in the n-tuples
 MSmits: but no way of training the params
 MSmits: so i have some set params
 MSmits: handpicked
 darkhorse64: I mean using board symmetry to divide the # of 4-tuples by 6
 MSmits: he does use that 
 MSmits: by 12 actually I think
 jacek: no, i use 102 n-tuples uniquely
 MSmits: not to train though?
 jacek: it is just i use symmetries for training so i have 12x more data
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I guess it's not exactly divided by 6 or 12.
 MSmits: some ntuples are 6-symmetric, others 12 or even 3
 MSmits: mmh no 3 doesnt seem possible
 jacek: im too dumb to make symmetries of them and to make them efficiently
 MSmits: me too
 MSmits: doubt it will be worth it
 MSmits: I only do it in meta mcts
 jacek: do you know how many unique of them are?
 MSmits: not sure, but i guess around 16?
 darkhorse64: Too much to do. I have some ideas to improve my score at AC, now that I understand BeamSearch, I want to get Legend at HS and reach level 40, ...
 MSmits: you never did beamsearch before?
 MSmits: it's one of the easiest algorithms to figure out
 darkhorse64: no, first on FC2020
 MSmits: well cool, another tool
 struct: me too
 struct: Icebox teached me
 MSmits: i used it in ooc, HS, probably others
 jacek: FC2020?
 MSmits: stupidly named contest
 DomiKo: Fall Challange
 DomiKo: 2020
 darkhorse64: I did a BFS for FC without realizing I was not going deep enough (I made the wrong tests). I also realize that I should have tried that at SC2020
 MSmits: oh right, i did beamsearch there too!
 MSmits: the pacman
 darkhorse64: I move from 140 to 50 with BS and a better scoring
 darkhorse64: pacman was a disaster. I knew my search was poor but I did not know how to focus on rewarding paths
 MSmits: a lot of players viewed it as a disaster, but i think it's mostly because it was just a hard game
 MSmits: there were 5000 contestants, remember that when you look at your 140 rank
 darkhorse64: A disaster for me. I do not blame the game
 MSmits: me neither, the game was ok
 MSmits: but because its so hard, its easy to think its your own fault for not getting a neat/clean search going
 darkhorse64: at SC, I was 350 but I am slowly sinking
 MSmits: while really, most players were flailing in the dark
 MSmits: ohh ok i thought you meant SC 140
 MSmits:  i have no idea about FC, didnt have the time&#160;:(
 struct: my code is a mess
 MSmits: btw darkhorse64, I am testing that full rollout thing for uttt again... hope this time you're right and it works
 darkhorse64: FC 140/7000 is a decent result for me
 MSmits: yeah seems good
 darkhorse64: I have drifted to 16th at UTTT, Time for a revisit
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 MSmits: depends, there are probably some things you can improve
 MSmits: public knowledge has changed
 jacek: full rollout thing?
 MSmits: just simulating from each child, instead of just one
 MSmits: i didnt get it to work for uttt
 MSmits: but use it almost everywhere else
 MSmits: somehow it was always worse with uttt
 darkhorse64: The only quick win I think of is to add a multiply bonus in my nodes for the value and classify nodes against wins, free moves, and teccles strategy
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: those should be tried
 MSmits: remember, you can also use teccles inside the search
 MSmits: not just when picking a move 
 MSmits: expansion will give you 1 child then
 darkhorse64: inside the rollout not only during selection&#160;?
 MSmits: if you do it in expansion, you can for sure do it in the random rollout
 MSmits: since the demand for accuracy is even lower there
 MSmits: so just do it everywhere. I lowered it to end at ply 20 just in case
 MSmits: so i only do it before 20
 MSmits: in endgames it's sometimes a bad choice
 MSmits: also look at the center move if you want
 MSmits: it's almost always bad, especially when the board is nearly empty 
 darkhorse64: Biasing the selection is one thing, biasing the rollout is more dangerous. Apart from book things, is there other "public" knowledge that I should know of&#160;?
 MSmits: these are the main things I think
 MSmits: currently i have a better way of testing new bot ideas
 MSmits: i add + random(0,01) to every move
 MSmits: so that i dont overfit
 MSmits: that way no submit is needed
 MSmits: or CG bench
 jacek: bonus for win small board and penalty for ending up on solved small board
 MSmits: yeah i dont currently use the bonus for winning small board
 MSmits: it didnt work for me
 MSmits: but the other one did
 MSmits: clear advantage (55%) 
 MSmits: I just add 0.2 to avoid rree moves
 MSmits: free
 MSmits: err subtract
 MSmits: from UCT score
 MSmits: that's a big penalty
 MSmits: it's like you're saying this node has 10% less winrate
 darkhorse64: I was thinking UCT like bonus * value + regret, bonus being 0.85 or 1.15 or 1.0
 MSmits: but all of these bot tweaks interact. If you add one, the other becomes worse
 MSmits: hmm thats dangerous
 MSmits: because if you do bonus * value, then when the value is negative, the bonus hurts you
 MSmits: I just add the bonus
 MSmits: in your case, if a node has winrate 50%, then the value is 0 and there is no bonus either
 MSmits: inline float Value()	{		return wins / (float)visits + bonus;	}
 MSmits: inline float UCT(float sqrtLogVisits)	{		return Value() + sqrtLogVisits * rsqrt_fast(visits);	}
 darkhorse64: I was thinking of a mutiply factor because the regret is unbounded. Yeah, quick/easy/cheap fix to the engine
 MSmits: you could also use progressive bias
 MSmits: bonus reduces with more visits
 MSmits: but you need to have *a lot* of visits before a free move node is properly valued
 MSmits: there are so  many moves and most of them are bad
 MSmits: so it has a low value for a long time, until some of the board-winning moves get selected and significantly raise the node value
 MSmits: needs thousands of visits
 darkhorse64: From my archives, the Russians and Ukrainains are using a constant bonus
 MSmits: yes, thats where i got it from
 MSmits: but they did it weirdly
 MSmits: they added it to the backpropagation
 MSmits: but thats the same as just adding it in selection
 MSmits: this way is cleaner
 darkhorse64: You are almost tempting me. :slight_smile:
 MSmits: not really trying to. I just like to talk about it
 MSmits: i can tempt you to try other board games as well
 MSmits: just let me know which you want and i'll boost your motivation by spamming about it
 MSmits: i've been thinking about breakthroughm but i am stuck as much as you are
 MSmits: I really want to try a meta mcts for it, but i need a good bot first, my bot is crap
 darkhorse64: I'll stick to my plan. Legend HS and level 40. 
 MSmits: HS is fun
 MSmits: legend should really be doable
 MSmits: legend itself is a mess
 MSmits: good idea to stop when you get there
 darkhorse64: I want to be above the clones. 
 MSmits: oh, then you're entering the mess
 MSmits: submissions will tell you nothing
 MSmits: because the ratings are too close
 jacek: clones?
 MSmits: yeah 3rd in contest shared his bot on gith
 MSmits: so its full of clones
 darkhorse64: Which rank is above the clones&#160;?
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 MSmits: dunno exactly, but probably around 20
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: 60 if you dont count improved clones
 MSmits: the funny thing with HS is that you dont need to really worry about performance too much
 darkhorse64: OK. Scoring 4K + CP is not going to be easy
 MSmits: once your bot is fast, you can go very deep with only like 10 ms
 MSmits: what is 4k + cp?
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: thats what you need for some rank?
 darkhorse64: Same for FC. More than 4000 CP
 MSmits: the grap is pretty steep isnt it
 MSmits: graph
 darkhorse64: In a way, yes, I have an internal competition with daaskar e. 
 MSmits: do you know him personally?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 MSmits: wait a min
 MSmits: you're like 1 rank below me
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: so i'm gonna be dropping further :P
 darkhorse64: steady and stubborn progress. Code golf, optims point by point
 MSmits: yeah if you focus on it, rank is pretty easy to get
 MSmits: i got some good boost from quest progress
 MSmits: hardcoding code of the ring :P
 MSmits: reeeally should have beamsearched that
 darkhorse64: I did too. Beam Search CotR&#160;? I did something simpler, Bruteforce on the four next chars but it's not very good but sufficient to be above many and benefit from all other contestants
 MSmits: I went through every case by hand
 MSmits: took the entire afternoon
 MSmits: at the end i was ranked 50 :P
 MSmits: one case is horribly long but i made it
 darkhorse64: 2K steps difference with me. Huge gap
 darkhorse64: I did not try searching because clearly "functions" are the only way to score well
 MSmits: shows how difficult it is to search
 MSmits: if you can do better by hand 
 MSmits: like numbershifting
 MSmits: some got to level 100, i had great trouble getting past 61 at first
 MSmits: with a search
 darkhorse64: You know Marchete's LAHC NS&#160;?
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: whats that
 jacek: hill climbing variant?
 darkhorse64: sec
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/Codingame/blob/master/Optimization/Number">https://github.com/marchete/Codingame/blob/master/Optimization/Number</a> Shift/NumberShift_LAHC.cpp
 MSmits: is this basically a freely shared solver?
 MSmits: or?
 Westicles: yep.  he changed some things to TODO, a teaching thing I guess
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: well that's ok
 MSmits: as long as it's not too easy to copy paste
 darkhorse64: I used that LAHC on A*C to improve my scoring. It's a bit crippled but the algorithm is interesting
 Westicles: xevi used LAHC as well. 
 MSmits: i favorited it, maybe i'll try it some time
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you can see the exchange here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-number-shifting/152425/25">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-number-shifting/152425/25</a>
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I tried it myself but it did not perform better than SA in my case
 darkhorse64: I mean LAHC can be applied on other problems and the implementation is clear enough to be reused
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 MSmits: I loved the dancing links algo
 MSmits: too bad it capped at the low 200s
 darkhorse64: It also tempts me to give a go at NS. I just solved 16 levels by hand
 MSmits: it's fun
 Westicles: Yeah, I think I'll make a run to 700 just to keep xevi interested
 darkhorse64: by hand&#160;? by search&#160;?
 Westicles: Good weather now for it :P
 MSmits: lol by hand at 700 :P
 MSmits: you cant even look at the board
 darkhorse64: new computer for Xmas&#160;?
 MSmits: you need toprint it yourself
 Westicles: Just SA.  It is really slow at these levels, maybe a day each
 MSmits: Westicles how do you keep SA running?
 MSmits: doesnt it have a temperature scheme that ends?
 MSmits: and then you start over?
 MSmits: it's not like minimax where you can keep it running forever and it will keep getting closer to the answer
 MSmits: or mcts
 MSmits: I guess you can set it to run for a day and hope it hits on the right answer?
 Westicles: Well, it runs for a few minutes each and finds a bunch of decent ones, then sends it off to an optimizer that tries for maybe an hour.  Then starts over
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: and you just experiment with these parameters
 MSmits: x minutes, y hours
 MSmits: i suspect you need to set them higher for higher levels to solve more quickly
 MSmits: I recently did my first SA on the travelling salesman for a teaching project
 Westicles: Yeah.  I was kind of disappointed, my theory was at some level they would get easier to solve.  More solutions available
 MSmits: yeah but also more restrictions i guess
 MSmits: i mean
 MSmits:  a greater space, so the fraction of solutions gets smaller
 Westicles: right
 MSmits: thats why level 61 was so hard
 hbq123-boop: :O
 hbq123-boop: 6`
 hbq123-boop: 61
 MSmits: there's like 2 solutions, so even if the space was small, the fraction is tiny
 jacek: oh my
 tarikyildiz: Hi, I started learning algorithm very difficult, first I learn big o
 hbq123-boop: good
 tarikyildiz: thx
 mzbear: ... third version of my Yavalath bot submitted. Now it also takes moves that open multiple 4-in-row opportunities. I suppose I should've made it also block enemy from taking those
 jacek: noice
 jacek: still no search
 mzbear: yep, unless you count iterating through all currently possible moves and picking decisive ones as a search :D
 mzbear: hmm, actually blocking enemy traps is harder than making traps, because enemy trap move might be 3-in-row for us, and traps can potentially be broken at any of the following winning moves as well
 jacek: yeah thats common. keep trapping until you trap means 3-in-row for opponent
 mzbear: alright, preliminary trap blocking implemented... somehow the code is cleaner than before implementing it, too, lol
 mzbear: this forced me to setup a uint64_t filter for currently valid moves, which cleaned up a lot of other code
 mzbear: oh yeah, this is doing much better
 mzbear: i might have to start doing a search soon
 mzbear: rank 39 ... oh, my bot is buggy, it doesn't understand when enemy steals my move!
 mzbear: rank 28 after fixing that bug
 mzbear: that's higher than i expected to get without search
 struct: Nice
 mzbear: my bot only does traps when it guarantees victory.  it only does detected decisive and forced moves, the rest is random
 jacek: :tada:
 MSmits: what did you do jacek?
 jacek: it was for mz :bear:
 MSmits: o
 ROMZAB28: za warudo
 MSmits: indeed
 mzbear: ugh. there's still a category of trap-leading losing moves that i'd like to detect before i start writing search, but i dont know if i should.  it might be better to just mutate the board and detect it at next step
 ROMZAB28: yes
 MSmits: make the search work
 MSmits: then worry about that
 MSmits: brb
 jacek: mutate board? :thinking:
 mzbear: mutate, as opposed to detecting the traps without changing the board
 jacek: oh, for a moment i thought about genetic algorithm :o
 mzbear: nah.  it's just that i can e.g. test up to 6 different 3-in-rows in parallel with pext etc
 mzbear: so of course it's better to do it without descending into search
 mzbear: oh, ffs, i have a bug.  it still improved my ranking, but i'm taking a decisive move when it's not actually decisive
 mzbear: let's see if my ranking drops because i fixed the bug :D
 mzbear: yeah, my bot is playing weaker now.  being decisive about blocking traps was good, even when forcing the enemy to move elsewhere would've also been valid
 mzbear: oh lol, i've written my code to not check if winning condition was reached, because referee ends the game before that.  not good for search ;D
 tarikyildiz: hello clash of code questions sound very confusing, what should I do?

 toosumit: hi
 toosumit: i need sleep
 Uljahn: no sleep till legend
 toosumit: what if it kills me
 Uljahn: raise an exception and call Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: of course i had to add a few more times
 toosumit: how to become moderator?
 VizGhar: eat a lot of brocolli
 toosumit: makes sense
 VizGhar: I think you have to be not idiot for 5 years straight to earn such accomplishment&#160;:)
 toosumit: 5 years!! I can hardly make it to 5 minutes
 MSmits: but when you manage it, you'll be the best moderator ever
 MSmits: If you can moderate yourself, you can moderate anyone. Think about that
 ian173: Why does clash keep making me do harder and harder captchas 
 ian173: *captchas
 ian173: Does it think I am a bot?
 MSmits: are you?
 MSmits: AutomatonNN is ian173 a bot?
 AutomatonNN: I'm just checking my code for some reason
 ian173: Bro I hope not, itd be hard to break to my parents
 MSmits: I'm guessing they already know
 MSmits: they coded you after all
 MSmits: AutomatonNN did you code ian173
 AutomatonNN: *couch*
 ian173: So clash didnt alway ask me to do a bot check every single time
 ian173: And now it is
 MSmits: you just did too many clashes
 ian173: Ah, that might be it then
 MSmits: probably you need to take a break
 MSmits: CG worries about your health
 struct: Im currently storing states until depth N, now I started reusing them.
 struct: I was thinking on doing also this for states and include skulls
 struct: So I would do like State at depth 1-N add 1-12 skulls
 struct: But the skulls could be added in any depth of the state
 struct: Was wondering how I should store it
 MSmits: no idea sorry
 MSmits: STC not my specialty
 struct: np
 struct: Im not even sure its worth to pre compute skull states
 struct: Maybe just compete skull states that my bot can do in depth N
 MSmits: or maybe sleep and solve the problem in your dreams
 struct: What if I solve it thenforget it
 MSmits: notebook next to bes
 MSmits: bed
 MSmits: wait no
 MSmits: a DREAM journal&#160;!
 MSmits: better name for it
 MSmits: though, if you dream about skulls it's technically a nightmare
 struct: Thats good, I might wake up and ill remember
 MSmits: let me know how that goes :P
 struct: My arena bot is so bad that my bot with no eval beated it 1 time&#160;:(
 MSmits: is this your new bot?
 struct: no
 struct: I dont have anything yet to submit
 MSmits: is your new bot the bad one?
 MSmits: oh
 struct: My arena is around 2 years old
 MSmits: ah I see
 struct: Both are bad, but the ide one is currently worse since it has no eval
 struct: Its just debug stuff for now
 SupSon: Does anyone know which version of the JDK works for brutal tester I'm seeing some weird errors running <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/game-ultimate-tictactoe">https://github.com/dreignier/game-ultimate-tictactoe</a>
 struct: 8
 SupSon: alright thanks
 MSmits: SupSon if you use a solver, you can very easily create an arena yourself
 MSmits: just trust the bot when it says it won
 MSmits: no need to sim
 SupSon: But if I want to test the strength between the two?
 SupSon: two different versions*
 MSmits: if they both have a solver its fine
 MSmits: it will output  the move + "WIN" 
 MSmits: then you know it won
 MSmits: if not, pass the move on to the other bot
 MSmits: and if that one says it "WIN's then trust that one
 SupSon: but it's running as an exe
 SupSon: then i'd need to write some management code
 MSmits: yeah, you need a framework for starting two processes and sending input and receiving output
 MSmits: i use a windows form
 MSmits: pretty easy
 MSmits: my point is, you can use this for any game that has a bot with a solver
 MSmits: since you dont need to sim the actual game
 MSmits: the bots do this for you
 SupSon: mmm ok i see
 MSmits: just dont have a bug in your solver :P
 SupSon: I never would
 MSmits: good&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh and if you run vs yourself, be sure to add some random to the bot
 MSmits: 0,01 to node value randomly
 MSmits: when it makes a move
 MSmits: otherwise it's likely very often going to play the same games
 MSmits: you get overtraining
 MSmits: even in utttt
 SupSon: yea I have randomness
 MSmits: kk
 struct: So with solver you can also not run the game until the end right?
 MSmits: yeah if the solver is good this can shave off 15 plies
 MSmits: 30% speed bonus to your brutaltesting
 MSmits: mmh maybe i should not be running 3 meta mcts's at once :P
 MSmits: stuffs starting to lag
 struct: You are doing 3 matches at once?
 MSmits: yes, for 3 different games
 MSmits: each running 1 instance of bots playing themselves
 struct: Poor cpu
 MSmits: uses 3 cores, but a small cost for the meta mcts part that starts the bot processes and handles the results
 MSmits: + a small cost i mean
 MSmits: i have 4 cores so...
 MSmits: i'll turn off my uttt one, it's the least important
 struct: What other games are you running?
 MSmits: currently, yavalath because i lost some games to robo earlier
 MSmits: and oware, cuz i still need to beat those NN's
 MSmits: well i already fixed the robo part mostly, but then i noticed some other lost games and before long i am trying to plug those holes too :P
 struct: lets see what jacek comes up with
 MSmits: yeah I am curious
 Illedan: Hi
 Illedan: Anyone have an idea iif it is worth to have 32 GB on a macbook, or if 16 GB is enough :thinking:
 Illedan: memory that is
 Westicles: Worth and macbook shouldn't be in the same sentence
 Illedan: That is another story :P
 HuynhNgocHai: Hello mother fucker
 HuynhNgocHai: What can i do? I'm nebie
 HuynhNgocHai: newbie\
 z64555: never enougn memory. Load it up to the max
 ChampionCoder: 16 GB is fine
 ChampionCoder: I use some 50 windows ay a time with 8 GB
 ChampionCoder: Ok that's a exagerration :sweat_smile:
 ChampionCoder: maybe 15 windows
 ChampionCoder: So don't waste money on that  much memory
 ChampionCoder: Unless you use a lot of high-priority applications
 mzbear: 16G isn't enough on my osx box, it always gets out of memory and start lagging
 mzbear: firefox in particular likes to regularly start eating 8G+ of ram all by itself

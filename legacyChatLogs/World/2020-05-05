 cegprakash: going live now
 LelouchVC2: C++ for the win in shortest mode
 AaronHe7: python is better sometimes
 CyberLemonade: hihi MadKnight
 AaronHe7: join clash pls
 MadKnight: hey CyberLemonade
 LelouchVC2: Sometimes huh xD
 mark7: Hello
 thibpat: hello :wave: I'm going live for more Twixt-PP, focusing on stopping these damn timeouts today! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/thibpat">https://www.twitch.tv/thibpat</a>

 LelouchVC2: I'm so dead
 LelouchVC2: It's like they took double the time just to get 80 less characters and beat me&#160;:((
 MadKnight: or bash
 ThePythonian: Yeah, I never really liked it that much, because it really just encourages spaghetti code
 occanowey: all of coc encourages spaghetti code
 cegprakash: hi MadKnight
 cegprakash: hi all..
 cegprakash: I'm planning to stream bot-programming (random challenge) with a starter (boilerplate) code in CPP. If you're interested flip a table
 WINWINWIN: Hi, anyone know if you can overload a constructor in python?
 Uljahn: you mean def __init__(self) and def __new__(self)&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: Something like that
 WINWINWIN: def __init__(self, args1): ...
 WINWINWIN: def __init__(self, args2): ...
 WINWINWIN: So that I can have a different set of parameters to initialize an object
 Uljahn: "You can't have two methods with the same name in Python -- and you don't need to."
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10202938/how-do-i-use-method-overloading-in-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10202938/how-do-i-use-method-overloading-in-python</a>
 WINWINWIN: So I cant overload init?
 WINWINWIN: do I use __new__ then?
 Uljahn: :upside_down:
 LoGos: well you can "overload" by using named arguments
 LoGos: or by using *args
 JohnCM: **kwargs if you want to overload arbitrary arguments, and they will be stored in a dictionary.
 JohnCM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://realpython.com/python-kwargs-and-args/">https://realpython.com/python-kwargs-and-args/</a>
 LoGos: for example:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/Wcalyp">https://ideone.com/Wcalyp</a>
 LoGos: and don't use __new__
 LoGos: and delete
 LoGos: unless you know what you are doing.
 Uljahn: ^
 LoGos: In my class I have seen people delete'ing all used variables
 LoGos: to save memory
 LoGos: as it was c++
 LoGos: del* not delete
 Uljahn: ah, those cargo cultists :relieved:
 LoGos: Uljahn could you explain to me something about GA? I'm practicing it on Mars Lander
 Uljahn: ye, go pm
 c0cainee: is it just me, or the timer ain't working?
 Uljahn: mine says next contest in 2 days 4 hours
 anid: Mine too
 c0cainee: Clash of Code - Fastest mode
 MSmits: it's the correct time
 c0cainee: it's stuck
 MSmits: oh the clash timer
 c0cainee: I meant there lol
 Illedan: MSmits, did you ever look into giving scores to smitsimax nodes based on the other nodes confidence?
 IAmNoob: the contest is in 2 days and 3,5 hrs
 inoryy: keep us posted
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 darkhorse64: I am playing with Mars Lander optim. I have reached 2300 with a GA and I wonder if I can get better without hardcoding
 IAmNoob: i dont think so
 BeardedWhale: darkhorse64 2300 fuel left?
 BeardedWhale: I have 2089 without hardcoding
 BeardedWhale: With just heuristics
 IAmNoob: do you guys know a good method to make level
 darkhorse64: 2313 fuel left over the 5 tests
 BeardedWhale: That can definitely be improved without any hardcoding

 IAmNoob: why?
 IAmNoob: why would it be brokn
 IAmNoob: broken
 AntiSquid: there's a notification on the compete button
 inoryy: eulerscheZahl will break it
 eulerscheZahl: CG plans to do an update directly before the contest
 eulerscheZahl: i'm scared
 Illedan: :scream:
 IAmNoob: :grimacing:
 AntiSquid: all code in VB.net since that will be only one left working :D
 eulerscheZahl: test with D but don't touch my C#
 AntiSquid: ah good point, all will be using D then :D
 Illedan: I'll use Rush
 Illedan: *rust
 IAmNoob: i c++
 AntiSquid: if they still work lol
 HotDidgeridoo_4aea: anyone code with GO?
 AntiSquid: you got to minimax the prediction, test will screw up best languages first :p
 IAmNoob: piece of S***, i was working on a problem and the site stopped
 AntiSquid: you should be mad about it and complain
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 wlesavo: it would be fun if battle for first in C# will be held in wood 2
 eulerscheZahl: no one accepts your contributions anyway IAmNoob
 IAmNoob: yeah
 IAmNoob: but i try
 IAmNoob: and its fun
 IAmNoob: and i help
 IAmNoob: in a way
 eulerscheZahl: upvote stats: -15, -7, -4, -11, 0, -5
 IAmNoob: yes, yes, yes ,yes
 IAmNoob: but it's better and better
 AntiSquid: what's going on with BOGOL&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: work in progress
 AntiSquid: i can see that
 AntiSquid: but have you seen the guy online recently?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: but i haven't seen him before the puzzle popped up
 eulerscheZahl: so that means nothing
 AntiSquid: he is from your country, you have to find him and bring him back
 AntiSquid: save the puzzle, save the world
 IAmNoob: how can i make better contributions?
 AntiSquid: learn from the other one
 AntiSquid: s
 AntiSquid:&#160;!!
 MayankBudhiraja: how to become better at coding?
 ashelkov: learn from the other one
 Jasperr: s
 Jasperr:&#160;!!
 wlesavo: wow, i thought chat is only available from lvl 3
 Illedan: Just client side stuff
 reCurse: "only"
 reCurse: Isn't it pretty much "solve onboarding" and another puzzle?
 Illedan: Should be from 40 and up only
 eulerscheZahl: enough to block most users. it's easier to solve 1 puzzle than to connect with an external client
 darkhorse64: 7 more "level up"s only and I can talk&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: but Illedan can use the chat for a few weeks already
 Illedan: :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: btw where's the 2500XP for OOC? :D
 Illedan: That's true
 reCurse: The XP is a lie
 Illedan:&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: Magu s got the reward twice (MM, A*C)
 Illedan: Asking thibaud now
 eulerscheZahl: i wouldn't have bothered :D
 Illedan: More important than SC
 eulerscheZahl: starcraft?
 Illedan: spring contest
 Illedan: What else are we going to call it?
 reCurse: PAC?
 eulerscheZahl: +1 for PAC
 reCurse: At least that's what marketing keeps telling m e
 Illedan: PAC it is
 eulerscheZahl: 2 days till the contest. i bet he's furiously writing the statement
 reCurse: No that's tomorrow
 reCurse: err
 reCurse: Thursday morning
 eulerscheZahl: and Fr on thursday?
 Illedan: *friday
 Illedan: And prizes in 2 weeks
 reCurse: Prizes already announced
 eulerscheZahl: contest starts on thursday
 reCurse: It's gamer RGB hardware
 eulerscheZahl: spoiler: no tshirts
 Illedan: Oh, I need that screen
 reCurse: You get FPS increases the more RGB flashing
 eulerscheZahl: that image you just shared on the forum reCurse... congrats, you have a fan
 reCurse: *a* fan?
 eulerscheZahl: a troll
 reCurse: More like part of my fan club
 reCurse: I get that at least once every week
 reCurse: Since god knows when
 Illedan: Didn't remove it by script yet?
 reCurse: The notification yes
 reCurse: But it's still in the bar
 Illedan: Or is this the real reason for you having your offline setup? :P 
 reCurse: As if I needed more reasons
 Illedan: True
 reCurse: I even did a beautiful ooc viewer I barely used
 reCurse: That's how cheap it is
 eulerscheZahl: within the last 2 months i only got 7 CoC invites by 4 unique users :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: your fan is my fan too
 reCurse: Well I changed my tagline, inspired by yours
 reCurse: Maybe it works now
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: Got a screenshot of your beautiful ooc viewer?
 reCurse: You like colored quads?
 Jasperr: ooc?
 Illedan: Anything is better than looking at my messy FB code trying to figure out why this idiot doesn't want to pick up the snaffles anymore
 reCurse: Oh right FB
 reCurse: Have to get back to that..
 reCurse: zzz
 eulerscheZahl: ooc = ocean of code @Jasperr
 Jasperr: ty &lt;3
 Eysp: I invited a new friend today, but he does not have a chat pane on the side. Any ideas why?
 Nanosplitter: Tell him to click the little arrow on the bottom right
 Eysp: He says there is no bar there at all
 Astrobytes: He needs to do a few puzzles and level up past level 3
 Eysp: I'm trying to get him to send a screenshot
 Eysp: oh, no chat until level 3?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Eysp: That makes a lot of sense then
 Eysp: Awesome, thanks
 Astrobytes: Think just one or 2 puzzles should do the trick
 Eysp: Yeah he is 2 already just from the tutorial and stuff
 Astrobytes: Cool beans
 Eysp: Thanks
 Astrobytes: No probs
 IjustKilledutoo: hello
 AntiSquid: how's it going lovely people?
 Astrobytes: Badly. You?
 AntiSquid: sleepy
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl u are rank 11 right now
 MohatuINfLamES: is there something called coding block
 cegprakash: you'll become a red coder?
 eulerscheZahl: rank 11 where?
 cegprakash: topcoder marathon match
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&amp;threadID=955289&amp;start=0&amp;mc=6#2407330">https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&amp;threadID=955289&amp;start=0&amp;mc=6#2407330</a> 
 eulerscheZahl: oh, not finished yet
 eulerscheZahl: was 16th before and one player passed me in the recalc already
 eulerscheZahl: so i guess 17th
 eulerscheZahl: screwed up at 2 points in my code
 MSmits: out of how many eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: 1. didn't use pythagorean distance
 eulerscheZahl: got from 16.9k to 15.5k on seed 2 with just that one change
 cegprakash: what :O phythagorean distance is better?
 eulerscheZahl: about of 80 MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: yes, such a simple change&#160;:/
 MSmits: ahh ok, hard to say if that's good or not... not sure what kind of players compete
 MSmits: if they're all topcoders, you did great
 cegprakash: if u score based onn phythagorean distancne how will u choose the grid size? do u have restrictionns like only 2 or 3?
 eulerscheZahl: and screwed up my beamsearch. tried a scoring function that was actually more expensive than expanding more childs
 eulerscheZahl: mostly 2x2 and 3x3
 eulerscheZahl: for larger boards i do a modification though
 eulerscheZahl: try to get the corner tiles somewhere inside and then make a large rotation to get them to the corner
 cegprakash: so u never care about the actual penalty?
 eulerscheZahl: i do
 eulerscheZahl: but i have a weighted scoring
 eulerscheZahl: let me explain a bit more...
 eulerscheZahl: i take a number (let's say starting with 1)
 eulerscheZahl: and check where i have to move it
 eulerscheZahl: so i greedily apply rotations to get it in place
 eulerscheZahl: but there are multiple options that get the number closer to the target
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: that's right
 eulerscheZahl: so i can choose the one fitting best with other numbers that i have to move as well
 cegprakash: mm
 cegprakash: heuristics
 eulerscheZahl: pythagorean distance makes me move diagonally
 eulerscheZahl: so i have more options for later rotations
 cegprakash: interesting
 cegprakash: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and when scoring the other numbers that i rotate, i also check when i plan to fix those
 cegprakash: so solving 1 number at a time can work :O
 eulerscheZahl: a number that i will fix very soon is more important than one that i fix at the end
 eulerscheZahl: distance also matters (more than linear)
 cegprakash: wait
 cegprakash: what do u mean by fix
 eulerscheZahl: get at the right place
 eulerscheZahl: if i have a number 2 cells away from the target and one like 40 away, then the one with larger distance is more relevant
 eulerscheZahl: i can get the dist of 2 later or might even break it again if i solve it now
 eulerscheZahl: the dist 40 needs work for sure
 cegprakash: oh so u identify what number to work on next?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/40aM8DfC">https://pastebin.com/40aM8DfC</a>
 eulerscheZahl: just play it on a larger testcase. that explains my strategy best i think. watch a replay
 cegprakash: so while u are moving 1 u suddenly change ur target to say 5 because 5 is too far from it's target than 1 to it's target
 cegprakash:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no, i solve the 1 completely
 eulerscheZahl: but while solving the 1, i still have an eye on other numbers
 eulerscheZahl: you can't just move the 1, you move at least 3 other numbers together with it
 cegprakash: so u have 1600 eyes
 eulerscheZahl: no, just a local view for my rotation
 cegprakash: what's the use of keeping an eye
 eulerscheZahl: and bruteforce with depth 2 in order to maximize the gain on other numbers while moving the 1 to the target
 cegprakash: oh so u make some rotations that does not involve 1 while solving 1
 eulerscheZahl: when i don't look at the 1 only but also the other numbers affected by my rotation, i get get them closer to their location as well
 eulerscheZahl: saving moves later when i fix those
 eulerscheZahl: but when fixing 1, i always rotate the 1 and get it closer to the target
 cegprakash: yes I get that
 cegprakash: but u always rotate a grid involving 1
 cegprakash: or sometimes u do rotations without 1
 eulerscheZahl: always with 1, until the 1 is in place
 eulerscheZahl: then i never touch it again
 cegprakash: mm
 cegprakash: so sometimes u rotate diagonnally sometimes vertically sometimes horizontally
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/_simanman/status/1255710921365716993">https://twitter.com/_simanman/status/1255710921365716993</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's siman (4th)
 eulerscheZahl: our strategies are somewhat similar but he has a better implementation
 eulerscheZahl: and my order is a little different, not doing the spiral
 eulerscheZahl: more like a diamond. corners first, then moving towards the edges
 cegprakash: nice
 cegprakash: so this strategy is just a guessinngn
 cegprakash: we need to try all 
 cegprakash: to find one
 cegprakash: I never thought we could really get any board to 0 location penalty
 cegprakash: so I just submitted a pleb search bot with mannhattan distance
 cegprakash: it does huge rotations as well if it improves score
 cegprakash: and I don't give priority to any rotation at all.. just any random rotation which improves score
 cegprakash: I saw ppl like u getting 70+ score on first submission
 cegprakash: and mine was at 20% after working hard to fix my sim. 
 cegprakash: and then I lost hope.. these guys must be smart
 eulerscheZahl: i have a working sim too
 eulerscheZahl: but there is no way to write a full search on this
 eulerscheZahl: so there are lots of heuristics involved to solve 1 number at a time
 cegprakash: mm
 eulerscheZahl: but a sim to find the right moves. improving the rest too while solving that one number
 cegprakash: but Psycho got a huge lead
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, impressive
 cegprakash: that makes the leaderboard scoring suspicious
 eulerscheZahl: Psyho btw. no c
 eulerscheZahl: he won(?) halite in the past
 eulerscheZahl: at least ranked really high
 eulerscheZahl: 2nd <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://2017.halite.io/programming-competition-leaderboard">https://2017.halite.io/programming-competition-leaderboard</a>
 cegprakash: it says fake psyho
 eulerscheZahl: it's the real one
 cegprakash: wow he works for OpenAI
 cegprakash: I love OpenAI bots on DotA
 cegprakash: that must be a nice job for him
 cegprakash: I really have no idea if future of AI will have a space for me to work on because my AI sucks :D

 cegprakash: no system test inoryy
 eulerscheZahl: choose a square and rotate it in a given direction
 eulerscheZahl: arrange the numbers. rotations of larger squares are more expensive
 eulerscheZahl: and there's a penalty for not fully solving the board
 inoryy: cool
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, was fun
 eulerscheZahl: system test in progress
 eulerscheZahl: for almost a week already
 cegprakash: haha
 inoryy: lol
 cegprakash: bcoz eulerscheZahl wrekt their servers
 eulerscheZahl: it's 84 contestants. that's a lot
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: u can see lot of active challenges and past challenges with cash prize to fix marathon judging
 cegprakash: they build their product with their product :P
 cegprakash: instead of hiring ppl

 Mak1000: Well great 
 Mak1000: Yea i know but try 8 
 Mak1000: Why gave up on Java&#160;? lol
 cegprakash: hey eulerscheZahl can you here me properly?
 Nanosplitter: I would give up on java for c# any day if it wasn't required for my university
 cegprakash: or should I talk louder or reduce music volume?
 eulerscheZahl: annoying music as usual
 Mak1000: Hahahaha
 Mak1000: Any Maths guru here lol
 eulerscheZahl: :thumbsup:
 jacek: java AND maths guy? does it exist?

 IjustKilledutoo: hello Dil
 eulerscheZahl: the bug about the broken timer is reported already
 IjustKilledutoo: okay
 DiL: oh thanks! sorry to push it, I just found it&#160;:-)

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/cegprakash">https://www.twitch.tv/cegprakash</a>
 eulerscheZahl: showing 0 at the top
 eulerscheZahl: that clash timer
 eulerscheZahl: oh i pinged ceg
 eulerscheZahl: sorry
 DiL: the clash timer always shows 0 if you use disableChat
 eulerscheZahl: no matter if you disable the chat or not
 eulerscheZahl: it shows 0
 DiL: wait... now i didn't use disableChat and timer is working fine for me
 eulerscheZahl: cegprakash trailing whitespace
 Insufficient: ok question about limitations of minimax 
 Insufficient: i know MCTS is better for ultimate tic tac toe but im learning this method first on that game
 Insufficient: in python3 i can only look 2 turns ahead or i timeout sometimes
 Insufficient: so i get an idea about order of differences
 Insufficient: have any of you guys got a c++ minamax for this one that can look 3+ turns ahead?
 eulerscheZahl: with python MCTS won't get you far either
 eulerscheZahl: there are minimax bots in legend
 eulerscheZahl: some players got around 8-10 i think (probably not in the first turn with huge branching)
 dbf: I read somewhere that dbdr has minimax in UTTT
 eulerscheZahl: zenoscave has one for sure
 dbdr: dbf correct
 eulerscheZahl: also: haven't seen you in a while, welcome back
 Insufficient: ok, so they probably also have a much smarter value function, but can you look like 5 moves ahead in c++?
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl u were trolling when u wanted me to invite ZarthaxX right?
 dbf: thanks, eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: of course, wanted you to troll zarthaxx
 dbf: mostly spend my freetime learning algorithm tasks, so had not too much time for contests&#160;:)
 Lopear: one manul
 eulerscheZahl: like codeforces?
 dbf: no, mostly books with some excercises
 eulerscheZahl: slightly related: kotlin heroes on may 29th
 eulerscheZahl: classic algorithmic problems, 2.5h duration
 dbf: need to learn kotlin, lol )
 ZarthaxX: dont troll me
 ZarthaxX: im a good bear
 eulerscheZahl: last time i coded in java and used the kotlin converter plugin from intelliJ
 dbf: dbdr I don't like your minimax for uttt because I can't reach first place in java because of it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol, what a cop-out
 Astrobytes: :D
 dbf: is a java code also a valid kotlin code?
 dbf: like with groovy
 eulerscheZahl: can be converted mostly
 eulerscheZahl: you have to add some forced allow-nulls
 dbdr: :D so you'll be happy when i RIIR dbf
 eulerscheZahl: dict[key]!!
 dbf: on my job I copy-pasted java into .groovy files to run them without compilation on server 
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 dbf: dbdr, yes, please
 dbdr: one day
 eulerscheZahl: RIIR? recode it in rust?
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://transitiontech.ca/random/RIIR">https://transitiontech.ca/random/RIIR</a>
 dbdr: yes. rewrite, canonically
 eulerscheZahl: close enough
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl there was still some noise during the stream
 cegprakash:&#160;:(
 LynxNoix: Hi guys
 cegprakash: i think the noise is coming from laptop's fan
 eulerscheZahl: an external microphone would help i guess
 dbdr: you streamed eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 struct: it was ceg
 dbdr: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: i only had a guest appearance on another stream once
 struct: You streamed 1 time before didnt you?
 struct: right
 eulerscheZahl: code a la mode aftermath
 eulerscheZahl: commenting on my bot
 dbdr: cameo&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: with a crappy microphone (or audio settings in the system)
 eulerscheZahl: so sometimes the first word of my sentence was muted :D
 Astrobytes: I remember that
 eulerscheZahl: and speaking in real time with the streamer, while the image was about 30s behind
 Astrobytes: The dude was completely misunderstanding you
 eulerscheZahl: oh, didn't know you saw the stream too Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Yeah I saw some of it
 Astrobytes: Some American guy, forgot his name
 DiL: it seems now the timer issue has been fixed! wow, thanks everyone
 eulerscheZahl: would be stressing to have a permanent 0 during the contest
 DiL: totally&#160;:-)
 cegprakash: hey eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: can u be my guest
 cegprakash: during my stream
 cegprakash: on Thursday
 cegprakash: u can make some jokes on my code
 cegprakash: u'll have a lot
 cegprakash: co-cast with me
 eulerscheZahl: i'll be busy with my own bot during contests
 cegprakash: alright
 eulerscheZahl: and you haven't seen me on the other stream
 cegprakash: lol
 eulerscheZahl: took me a simple "can you hear me" and smits said "i can hear someone with a german accent"
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 cegprakash: then smits is the guy I want
 cegprakash: I want to be trolled
 cegprakash: roasted
 Astrobytes: I'll troll you in the chat ceg
 Astrobytes: Since you asked nicely :P
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: how is my Indian accent jokes apart
 Astrobytes: Fine? I have no trouble understanding you at all
 cegprakash: good :D
 cegprakash: so I have hopes to get job in other countries
 DiL: does anyone has good resources on learning dynamic programming (with python)?
 Astrobytes: You can definitely get jobs in other countries, your English is fine
 cegprakash: hey DiL if u understand arrays/multi dimentional arrays u can understand DP tutorial on any language
 cegprakash: u don't really have to search for Python tutorials on DP
 cegprakash: just search on youtube for DP tutorials
 PetrutV: how is the ranking in clash of code calculated? or is it just time based?
 struct: Depends on what type 
 struct: fastest and reverse = speed
 struct: shortest = code length
 jacek: its based on place
 struct: Then  it depends on ranks of other players
 jacek: if youre 1st, doing it in 1 minute or 2 minutes doesnt matter
 DiL: thanks cegprakash! i'm ok with multidim arrays, I'll keep on searching good videos, maybe I havent find a good one
 Uljahn: Your rank in Clash of Code depends on your score which is computed with a TrueSkill-based system. Winning (resp. losing) a clash will increase (resp. decrease) your score by an amount which depends on the players you faced in that clash.
 cegprakash: DiL also search for recursive DP implementations. I always do DP using recursion as the code looks so clean
 cegprakash: it's difficult for me to think a DP problem in array.. because I always look a DP as a DAG (directed acyclic graph)
 cegprakash: and imagining a DAG in an array is little difficult for me
 cegprakash: so whenever u see a DAG, you can apply DP there DiL
 DiL: ehi thanks a lot! these are the kind of tips I'm looking for
 cegprakash: this you won't find on any tutorial
 cegprakash: only very strong DP guys will teach DP = DAG
 cegprakash: I'm one of them :D
 Astrobytes: So modest :D
 cegprakash: Astrobytes show me any DP tutorial which talks about DP = DAG
 cegprakash: u can rarely find one
 Astrobytes: I believe you man!
 DiL: cool, so what's your youtube channel?&#160;:-)
 cegprakash: wait.. I'll share..
 Astrobytes: Interesting way to view it actually
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geKWw-Yill4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geKWw-Yill4</a> 
 DiL: I struggle a lot with DP, mainly because I force myself to think to tables as a way to apply DP
 cegprakash: there are 3 parts of videos
 cegprakash: for the first part enable subtitles
 cegprakash: I put in the subtitles by myself
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: adding subtitles is a hectic job
 cegprakash: :D
 DiL: I'm definitely check it out. thanks again... I'll let you know about it:-)
 cegprakash: cool&#160;:) 
 PluckyPenguin: evening / morning all how's it going?
 JabrailzadeAli: hello
 JabrailzadeAli: what's up everyone
 AntiSquid: AchrafLy
 AntiSquid: acat&#160;?
 AntiSquid: oops sorry to the other guy i pinged
 Dhruv-Garg79: hello guys,
 Dhruv-Garg79: does anyone know how to find distance b/w two nodes in BFS without using parent.
 zades: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-if-there-is-a-path-between-two-vertices-in-a-given-graph/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-if-there-is-a-path-between-two-vertices-in-a-given-graph/</a>
 zades: i think this might help
 MSmits: if you just need the distance, you keep a property "travelled distance" on the nodes. 
 MSmits: the moment you hit your target, you also know the distance
 MSmits: but this might actually be slower than just keeping a parent and backtrack at the end, counting nodes
 Astrobytes: Info here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/955c1d5a-e3bf-4edc-b9a0-5355205afff0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/955c1d5a-e3bf-4edc-b9a0-5355205afff0</a>

 Astrobytes: hi MSmits
 MSmits: the optimizing bfs link assumes you know the algo already
 MSmits: hi Astrobytes
 struct: Hi, I have a few doubts on mcts still
 MSmits: ok
 struct: So when I create root
 struct: should I auto expand?
 MSmits: your selection function will stop when it hits an unexpanded node. That should be your root
 MSmits: should happen automatically
 struct: So when it select unexpanded
 struct: I expand and do rollout?
 MSmits: yes 
 MSmits: you can use various methods to identify an unexpanded child
 Dhruv-Garg79: Thanks MSmits, zades and Astrobytes. I finally did it using dist array.where dist[des] = dist[source] + 1;
 MSmits: I used to look at visit count, but that may be bug prone. Now I just use my childindex property, if it is 0, then its unexpanded
 struct: and the expanded child in that expansion matter for ayntihng?
 MSmits: Dhruv-Garg79 good
 struct: expanded childs*
 MSmits: what do you mean struct
 struct: So I selected a unexpanded node
 MSmits: oh, you mean for the rollout?
 struct: I expand and do full rollout
 struct: yes
 MSmits: you rollout from a child
 MSmits: you can select the first one, but random selection could be better
 struct: So the backpropagation will start from that child right?
 MSmits: depends on how you code it
 MSmits: my backpropagation doesn't go back
 MSmits: goes from the top to the bottom
 MSmits: i keep track of all nodes i selected
 struct: Yeah I do something smilar
 MSmits: and just loop over them
 MSmits: that makes it so you dont need a parent reference
 MSmits: makes a big difference if you have a node pool of 25 million nodes
 Astrobytes: I forgot about that trick
 MSmits: and none of them need the 8 byte reference
 MSmits: 8 byte * 25 million = 200 mb
 struct: So you talked about the random selection
 MSmits: yeah i never actually do that
 struct: I should do that while parent visits &lt; x right?
 MSmits: either i just pick the first one
 MSmits: or I pick all of them and do a rollout for each child
 struct: full rollout seems nice
 struct: for each child I mean
 Astrobytes: The random selection was Smitsi-specific iirc
 MSmits: it's important you do the UCT thing when all children have been visited
 MSmits: Astrobytes no i think it's a mcts thing
 Astrobytes: For the first few turns
 MSmits: you're supposed to select randomly to avoid bias
 MSmits: for example if you're navigating a maze and your move generation always does a move left first. Then if you always select the first move, you'd be going left an awful lot
 struct: Currently I use UCT, even if a children doesnt have visits
 MSmits: depends on the game what the effect is
 MSmits: that's going to crash you
 struct: I just give it inf score
 MSmits: there is a division by visit count
 MSmits: ah why bother using UCT at all before at least N visits... there is no point
 MSmits: you have no statistics
 Astrobytes: In your smitsi writeup you select randomly before using UCT, so you have something to work with
 Astrobytes: For like first 10 or so
 struct: I use before N visits
 MSmits: ohh right, 
 MSmits: I did do that
 jacek: UCT for 0 visits is just inf
 Astrobytes: ^
 jacek: so each child will be visited eventually. unless you do some fixed low FPU
 MSmits: Astrobytes I think this was mostly to avoid some sort of weird resonance, where both players keep selecting the same nodes. Random fixes that
 Astrobytes: Kk, gotcha
 MSmits: the thing is that when both players select a bad move, it's just as good as when both players select a good move
 MSmits: so if they always select the same move, you're never gonna know what good moves are
 MSmits: mcts does not have this problem at all
 struct: I wonder how much will the mcts "fix" will change my bot
 MSmits: if we're talking about UTTT, you wont see a difference, except you win more and rank higher
 Astrobytes: lol, no difference
 MSmits: if it works correctly that is
 MSmits: well it's hard to know what a good move is aside from the obvious try to get 3 in a row
 MSmits: and block the opponents
 icecream17: Hey, at the compete section there's a 1 like its a notifications
 Astrobytes: It's just the updated contest page
 MSmits: Worked all day in the garden today so i dont have to do anything for 2 weeks :P
 MSmits: maybe tonight or tomorrow I prepare all classes for next 2 weeks. There arent so many
 Astrobytes: I've got an emergency x-ray at hospital tomorrow for my back, hoping I'm gonna be OK for contest&#160;:/
 MSmits: sucks&#160;:(
 MSmits: glad they could make time for you, a lot of stuff has been postponed
 struct: The "make children" function in my mcts is the most expensive
 Astrobytes: Our area is not hit too badly thankfully
 struct: 40% of my code is wasted there
 MSmits: with me it only used about 5% I think
 MSmits: selection uses a lot though
 struct: Yes but I dont think you call it 1765467  times :p
 MSmits: during the game, not in the first few turns
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: I call it half that many times in the first turn
 struct: Dont forget its not the true mcts
 MSmits: right
 struct: Mine is something different 
 MSmits: you did weird stuff
 struct: I thought it was like this&#160;:(
 struct: What I get for not reading
 MSmits: you're not the first
 MSmits: Maddy did this too
 MSmits: on his first mcts 
 MSmits: pretty common mistake I guess
 struct: In my defense it makes a bit of sence
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: allright gotta go do some stuff, ttyl!
 struct: cya
 struct: and thanks again for explaining
 Astrobytes: laters
 icecream17: =O there are prizes?
 struct: at the bottom
 icecream17: Private clashes can have a lot more players. Hmm...
 AntiSquid: wtf is going on Astrobytes? thought you would be more fit
 AntiSquid: is it the sedentary life style&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I appear to be having some kind of spinal compression
 AntiSquid: but how from what sinc when? is it something from years ago that just got worse with age?
 Astrobytes: Getting numbness in my leg and face, as well as the back pain. No it's relatively new. Since this year
 struct: damn&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I am normally fit and healthy
 AntiSquid: well fingers crossed, might just be aftereffect of the virus&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No I've had some symptoms prior to the virus
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Meh. I'll see what they have to say, not gonna waste time speculating.
 AntiSquid: get well soon
 Astrobytes: Thanks man
 AntiSquid: even Automaton2000 wishes you that
 Automaton2000: i know what you mean
 AntiSquid: see?
 Astrobytes: lol

 Astrobytes: lol, he's doing that just to troll us
 Astrobytes: +he likes it...
 Astrobytes: I sincerely hope I'm OK for the contest so I don't miss the opportunity to troll ceg on twitch :D

 AntiSquid: stream with baby metal on :D
 Astrobytes: lol ffs
 Astrobytes: Music still too loud cegprakash, or did you turn down your mic?
 AntiSquid: the headphone are to protect his ears from the song 
 AntiSquid: he might even have ear plugs underneath

 Illedan: True, but that version is actually good
 AntiSquid: seriously it ruins it for me&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: no offense
 Astrobytes: Yeah no offense but it's just as bad as the ones I posted :P
 icecream17: i'm on a school account and it says "video has not been approved yet"
 Astrobytes: Well... 
 Astrobytes: maybe not *quite* as bad
 Illedan: You going to GA that one? :P

 Illedan: Binary search works though
 Illedan: but :snail:
 Astrobytes: FASTEST mode
 Astrobytes: :P
 Illedan: shhh
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: if you train a model on it, it should know the result immediately&#160;!
 icecream17: i never knew watching someone else code was so exciting
 Astrobytes: Should have used the D
 Illedan: 2 more min, can he do it
 Astrobytes: Who does fastest in C++? Not that I clash any more but... seems ever so slightly counter-intuitive :P
 icecream17: why not... redactedMathFunction(diag)
 Astrobytes: Aaaaand not eve using namespace std; 
 Astrobytes: *even
 AntiSquid: 32 sec
 Astrobytes: "Oh no"
 Astrobytes: :D
 Illedan: Nope, no more time :P
 icecream17: suspense
 icecream17: TOP 3!!!!!
 AntiSquid: no idea what the puzzle is 
 icecream17: You have diag and ratio between 2 sides are are trying to get the length of the sides
 Astrobytes: cegprakash save some time and use  using namespace std; if you must use C++
 Astrobytes: So no more std::
 AntiSquid: ah! but wait isn't that easy icecream17&#160;?

 Illedan: I'll stream the contest next week
 struct: D stream?
 Illedan: The stream!
 Astrobytes: The only stream I usually watch in full during the contest is JBM's Haskell stream
 LelouchVC2: I tried learning haskell for about 20 minutes
 Astrobytes: Because I'm FP-curious and it's entertaining
 JBM: a true fan
 cegprakash: okay my volume is too less
 LelouchVC2: is there a "real" tutorial for haskell?
 icecream17: i wikipediaed it.
 Astrobytes: Real?
 LelouchVC2: A good one I guess I mean
 LelouchVC2: if you've learned haskell
 Astrobytes: I'm very basic (ahem) in Haskell, I know a wee bit of Scheme and Racket
 struct: Why do you want to learn haskell?
 JBM: why not?
 LelouchVC2: I heard it was an interesting language. I guess I'll leave it till later
 struct: Im just asking, its always easier to get into it if you have an idea to do with it
 AntiSquid: 2nd sunday legend stream Illedan :p
 Illedan: :D
 JBM: you can do, like, all CG puzzles
 Astrobytes: I find Haskell quite elegant
 LelouchVC2: I heard it described as a lazy language. Hopefully I'll get to it before I die
 Astrobytes: At least to a noob such as myself
 Flyingkid: Will we get to code in Swift soon :upside_down:
 JBM: yeah i like it too
 Flyingkid: ooh nvm its already there. where have i been. lol
 LelouchVC2: In the shadow realm
 Flyingkid: is it even shadow realm  anymore. i think its called VRAINS or something now
 Astrobytes: whoosh
 AntiSquid: for a moment i thought it's tickles in chat, Flyingkid's avatar looked similar
 Astrobytes: He's not doing any contests anymore afaik&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: i thought its just ooc
 Astrobytes: He wasn't sure. Have to wait and see I guess
 LelouchVC2: Yea, Yu-Gi-Oh has like 10000 generations now
 LelouchVC2: I liked GX because they brought Yugi into it in the beginning and end - and it also gets dark
 LelouchVC2: But not hooking up with the hot chick to run off to see spirits pissed me off
 Astrobytes: Yu-Gi-Oh? Sounds like you've got a stomach complaint or something
 pmeikle: it's heavily implied i'm pointing a gun at you!
 LelouchVC2: You've never seen it??
 AntiSquid: are you saying teccles is a voice actor for yugioh?
 Astrobytes: No
 pmeikle: the english version of yugioh is way censored lol
 LelouchVC2: Damn, childhood destroyed
 Astrobytes: I have never seen it
 LelouchVC2: Go watch yu-gi-oh
 AntiSquid: talking to LelouchVC2
 Astrobytes: No
 pmeikle: yugioh abridged on YT, is funny
 Astrobytes: How old are you
 LelouchVC2: teccles?
 LelouchVC2: I'm 12
 Astrobytes: I am 37
 LelouchVC2: Lol, I'm 20 😂
 LelouchVC2: I say I'm 12 in video games
 AntiSquid: yugioh is a very old japanese cartoon, i've watched it when i was 12  - 15 or so it aired on TV
 LelouchVC2: Nice! I loved that show
 Astrobytes: It must have passed me by squiddy
 LelouchVC2: GX was a way for it to live on
 LelouchVC2: But then it started doing some weird shit with ghosts and motorcycles
 AntiSquid: plot twist Astrobytes i later realized it's just a monstrous advert for a children's card game
 LelouchVC2: And every new generation had longer hair than the last
 AntiSquid: the entire show is a fucking advert with a good plot for first season
 Astrobytes: Like Transformers, with a plot
 LelouchVC2: Yea, it's for a card game, but it was so good
 Astrobytes: Except Transformers didn't even have a card game
 LelouchVC2: Pokimon has a card game

 Uljahn: Automaton2000: pls respond
 Automaton2000: i need to read it
 Uljahn: ok
 KiwiTae: yashjain27 not too hard to be honest 
 fvla: this is easily solvable using dynamic programming
 OrdoFlammae: I'm having a lot of trouble with the Ghost in the Cell puzzle, where the input for 'entityCount' is always zero. I'm not sure why this is. I'm using Clojure, but I don't think the language should affect anything.
 fvla: if you haven't made significant changes, then restore default code
 LelouchVC2: These clashes get so retarded
 LelouchVC2: I'm sitting here with working code having to make like 10 conditions for spacing because the tests can't deal with it
 LelouchVC2: If there's an extra space at the end, the tests shouldn't freak out!

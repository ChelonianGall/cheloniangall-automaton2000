 nivasav668: Hello World
 Alemhan: hi
 1457162: tourist, Radewoosh, T1024 and eulerscheZahl - congratulation for success (and prizes&#160;;-) ) in ICPC contest (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1524/standings/page/1">https://codeforces.com/contest/1524/standings/page/1</a>)
 russell_07: Hi
 eulerscheZahl: thanks JFB, was a tough fight&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: :watch:
 BlackGriffin03: can I see who are all in my school use codingame

 BlackGriffin03: Thanks @eulerscheZahl
 mc_cari: how to create a private contest?
 eulerscheZahl: you have to contact Thibaud on this. But unless it's for a school/university it will cost a bit (i have no idea how much)
 eulerscheZahl: this Thibaud: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/u/_cg_thibaud/summary">https://www.codingame.com/forum/u/_cg_thibaud/summary</a>
 Westicles: Copying an existing multi into a draft contribution is a good poor man's contest
 eulerscheZahl: but you get very few games that way. it's more to test the game than to have a stable leaderboard
 Neix20: hi
 Westicles: Well, okay well maybe replace 'good' with 'free'
 1457162: eulerscheZahl: yes, difference between 6-22 are very small. For me it was very frustrating - Yesterday I spend all day coding without any change in score due to bugs I can not found. What was your approach if I can ask?
 eulerscheZahl: mostly greedy, then a bit of bruteforce at the end to clean up
 eulerscheZahl: first i see how the paths go: if all paths from start =&gt; A =&gt; end also go through B, they are buddies
 eulerscheZahl: and in the same region
 eulerscheZahl: then I try to add any remaining nodes that can be in parallel (that is non-marked) to these buddy groups
 eulerscheZahl: gives a score of 13k already
 eulerscheZahl: if you update the upper bound properly (relatively fast to compute) in order to add more single nodes to the group, you are already somewhere around 11k
 eulerscheZahl: updating the lower bound is more costly (at least I didn't find a cheap way), which is why I only do that in a final run of all still remaining nodes
 1457162: I see. So similar to my concept - but I have bugs&#160;:-( Thank for answer&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: and at the very end I take all buddy regions and try to split them to the other regions
 eulerscheZahl: really nothing too clever. lots of trial and error
 1457162: But it was effective&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: i surely missed something, looking at top2 in particular
 eulerscheZahl: even tried to add random pairs of 2 nodes at once while doing the expensive lower bar update. gained a total of 2 points :D
 StevensGino: I still in top 7xx in csb legend really don't know how to continue&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: MadKnight your turn
 eulerscheZahl: at the very top we have neural networks. Then UCT forest, minimax, genetic algorithms below
 eulerscheZahl: all the top player reimplemented the game engine to predict the outcome of their actions and look some turns ahead
 StevensGino: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: there are even some articles linked on the overview page of the game
 StevensGino: most of the articles are about GA

 eulerscheZahl: that's the current #2
 StevensGino: thank you
 StevensGino: this is great
 Westicles: top four are NN?
 Westicles: or more of them
 FrancoRoura: I guess their LinkedIn inbox must've become really annoying lol

 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah I just ran open ended path intersects
 PatrickMcGinnisII: had to use it to block boss as well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i dunno where boss source is anyways

 1457162: But I failed to implement the algo properly and of course it do not work for nodes in the middle. 
 1457162: To be honest: I took me around 1-2 hours to understand rules of the contest - I do not very good with graphs theory. So at least I have learned something (for example Knuth algo - :shame:)
 jacek: what contest

 1457162: Just finished 
 1457162: Prises for first 20 - euler was #14
 StevensGino: I don't even know what is the contest
 PoomTwT: :neutral_face:
 1457162: contest is short for 'programing contest' (other names: challenge, marathon and so on). You have problem(s) and period of time and scoring system. Sometimes prices for the best. On each platform they are different rules
 1457162: on codinggame they are usually 2 contests / year. Usually 10 days, you write program to play defined game and scoring system is based on you win/lost with other players
 StevensGino: @JFB, I just mean: I don't know which is the contest you are mention
 StevensGino: for "contest" meaning, ofcouse I know it
 StevensGino: btw I already check your link, so I will check it abit
 1457162:&#160;:-) Sorry - sometimes my "nature teacher" comes to the fore 
 StevensGino:&#160;:)
 1457162: This contest was on codeforce.com platform. was 4 days, it was similar to optimization problems on codingame. You have had to write program to divide graph according to defined rules. It was different that on codingame: you only receive final result - you even do not know numbers of graphs. And it was no test graphs as in codingame.
 1457162: I mean: "no known test graphs" for the test
 1457162: No visualization too
 1457162: codingame is unique with its rules (known test cases for optimization problems, visualization and so on)
 MSmits: yay my 31 seed book generator is working
 ddreams: what is seed in this context?
 MSmits: oware
 MSmits: if the game gets down to 31 seeds it predicts the net result. This assumes no turn limit
 JFB: What it is "seed book generator"?
 ddreams: I see
 MSmits: endgame book basically JFB
 ddreams: Recommend the game?
 MSmits: sure, fun game to me if you like simple boardgames
 MSmits: funny thing is, this generator uses about 15 mins per iteration and needs 300 iterations to finish I think. so it'll be a week or so
 MSmits: only problem is it spits out a 11 GB book every 15 mins and i need to delete the old ones or my SSD gets full :P
 JFB:&#160;:-) 
 ddreams: one day I'll need the hardware I scavenged from an old employer when they moved to the cloud
 MSmits: i only need the last book, but I need to store in between 
 MSmits: haha yeah, use that stuff
 MSmits: I remember my uncle did this when he worked at IBM
 MSmits: stuff was supposed to be destroyed but he gave it to us back then
 JFB: Not only bitcoin increase SSD prices - MSmits's oware too&#160;:-) 
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: I need to store all 31 seed states in memory while running, which also uses 11 GB RAM, but it needs to be stored twice, to move between iterations, so I am using 22 GB RAM non stop 
 MSmits: crazy stuff. I was using 8 bit per state before because of convenience, but i had to compress it to 6 bit per state otherwise it would not leave enough for windows to run
 JFB: I seen article about memory and disc use in modern programs - author said that use RAM/disc is programin from 70's 
 JFB: *programing in 70's way
 MSmits: hmm not sure what you mean
 JFB: because RAM is cashed on the disc and disc are very fast now - it is good to analise the case and write program accordingly
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: well memory access is my bottleneck. During the runtime it's looking up stuff from all over the 11GB at the same time
 MSmits: what is the speed difference between RAM and SSD?
 JFB: I'm not sure - but offten on modern architecture they are layers of cache in processor and memory and SSD so often it is not so simple - RAM and disc
 MSmits: ah ok, but i suspect RAM is still several times faster
 JFB: But not 1000 as in 70's&#160;:-)
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: so with RAM this takes a week and with SSD it would take a month or more :P
 JFB: I simply want to say that maybe it will we faster to write program is such way that it is 22 GB memory (11 real and 11 virtual) and lets system do the rest. I'm not sure is it your case
 MSmits: well it's hard to say
 MSmits: first iteration finished
 MSmits: iterations: 1 different: 15338678263 908226 ms.
 MSmits: different has to 0, then it's done
 MSmits: took 200+ iterations with 20 seeds
 MSmits: so probably 300 or so, times 15 minutes
 JFB: MSmits - I do not know what "seed" is
 MSmits: seeds on the board in oware
 MSmits: game starts at 48
 MSmits: more seeds = more states possibly
 MSmits: 1 seed = 12 states, 2 seeds = 78 states etc.
 JFB: OK. So in the game you reduce number of seeds
 JFB:&#160;?
 MSmits: 31 seeds = 15338678263 states
 MSmits: yeah, you capture 
 JFB: And you want tho have simple "table" with win/lost/tiebreak for eaach of states with 31 seeds?
 MSmits: the idea is to look up the endgame result as soon as 31 seeds or less are on the board. 
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: i want to know the net result for captered seeds
 MSmits: captured
 MSmits: so if a particular board has 20 seeds on the board. What is the net capture score from the perspective of player 1
 MSmits: if both players play perfectly
 MSmits: that way i can add this to the current score and know who won
 JFB: So maybe I do not say it correctly but I wanted to say the same. Probably my bad english
 MSmits: ah yes, but you meant a WLD lookup win/loss/draw. This is not that
 MSmits: because if you lookup -5 seeds, it doesnt mean you lost
 MSmits: you could be 11-2 ahead
 MSmits: so it needs to be combined with current score
 JFB: I assumed that game finish (have 'net final state' - win/lost/tie form perspective of player 1). It is not correct?
 MSmits: nope.
 MSmits: it looks up  a seed score
 MSmits: that doesnt tell you who won
 JFB: OK. State + curent score 
 JFB: OK
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: its nice because you can have the same state with 11-2 score or 9-4 score
 JFB: state + curent score = win/lost. 
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: this is called score-less states
 MSmits: states with no score. You handle score separately
 JFB: So you need table of results (points) from all 31 seed position to add it to current score
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: I use 6 bit for it
 MSmits: -31 to +31 fits
 MSmits: 31 if player 1 gets all the points
 MSmits: -31 for player 2 getting all
 MSmits: and everything in between
 JFB: So in the game number of seeds do not increase?
 MSmits: nope only decrease
 MSmits: it's like checkers where normal pieces can only move forward
 JFB: I do not know the rules so the stupid question
 MSmits: you should check it out if you like boardgames. It's super simple
 JFB: So I understud that you start with all say 20 sees position - calculate it all and create table for 21 sieeds using this table and so on?
 MSmits: yeah thats one aspect of it
 MSmits: but i also do this with different numbers of turns remaining
 MSmits: so i start from 1 turn remaining
 MSmits: then i do all states from 2 turns remaining
 MSmits: and i use the result from the 1 turns remaining states
 MSmits: and i keep doing that until x turns remaining gives the same result as x+1 turns remaining
 JFB: What is the number of 31 seed position?
 MSmits: 15,338,678,263  including also all the lower seed positions
 MSmits: i need to keep the lower ones in memory also
 MSmits: because a capture from 31 seed state may lead to 20 seed state
 JFB: So in what way you want it to use in scoring function on codingame?
 MSmits: I want to use it for supervised learning of a NN
 MSmits: in combination with a meta mcts
 JFB: OK&#160;:-) 
 MSmits: if i have the data, supervised learning is easier to do than what the other oware NN guys are doing
 MSmits: azero-type stuff
 JFB: So you can add tou you CV: "using AI to compress data"&#160;:-)
 MSmits: sure&#160;:)
 MSmits: I am mostly doing this as an intermediate step to azero type NN's. I think that is too hard for me right now
 MSmits: since i am already good at this endgame book stuff and meta mcts, i figured i'd use what i know
 MSmits: if that werent true, this would be madness :P
 JFB: So you give yourself 1 week time (running computer) to learn meta mcts and othe staff&#160;:-)
 JFB: Smart
 MSmits: well 1 week to generate the book then x time to run meta mcts while I work on NN stuff
 MSmits: i am not in a hurry
 JFB:&#160;:-)
 JFB: So it looks 1 month to #1 bot in oware&#160;:-)
 MSmits: haha doubt that. The oware NN's are really really good
 MSmits: hard to top that
 MSmits: I will be happy if i beat my own bot
 JFB: Good luck - it really looks as working strategy
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 JFB: or at least "learning strategy"&#160;:-)
 MSmits: thats the most important thing  i guess
 MSmits: oo crap the books are being dumped in a folder monitored by google sync
 MSmits: ye google is not going to like this
 JFB:&#160;:-) 11 GB / 15 min&#160;:-)
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: I have 15 GB free storage
 MSmits: soooo
 JFB: I have used 98% of my 15 GB free storage - thanks to remind me about it - have to go do something with it&#160;:-)
 MSmits: yeah, the trash thingy is annoying. I keep having to delete the same files. There is some delay and it doesnt empty all at once
 MSmits: aw crap, that 15 mins was just the 1st iteration. Rest are 1,5 hrs each =/
 MSmits: ah well
 jacek: oO
 struct: Are you using all the cores?
 jacek: he cant write so probably yes
 struct: :D
 densch: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eb9f69fc-117e-43c0-b118-b9f75bd027dd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eb9f69fc-117e-43c0-b118-b9f75bd027dd</a>
 jacek: hm?
 Scarfield: a mistake on the angle maybe?
 densch: basically in the mars lander 2 missing, the game seems to be mixing up what it should do if above the target area and if outside. not sure why thoug
 Westicles: the game is getting it wrong?
 densch: I'm probably doing it wrong not sure
 Scarfield: you are&#160;:) the game has been tested by many
 densch: x&lt;2000 should be the area left, x&gt;3500 should be the right area and 2000&lt;x&lt;3500 should be above the landing area, right?
 densch: thats at least how I read it from the initial input
 densch: and given the change in behavior at least the borders seem to be right
 densch: i'll just continue trying it, sooner or later I'll probably get where I am dping some really dumb msitake&#160;:-)
 Scarfield: what language you coding in?
 densch: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/19350fed-4790-402c-853a-bfbee80d21b1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/19350fed-4790-402c-853a-bfbee80d21b1</a>
 densch: is what I wrote
 densch: am using java
 densch: I know that there will be error if angle goes &gt;90 or &lt;-90 but thats not my main issue here
 Scarfield: why System.out.println("-20 3"); when inside the landing area?
 densch: I first wanted to see if it even flies into the target area, was the default text left there.
 densch: thing is:
 densch: in test case 1, it keeps a constant -20 rotation until its in the target area.
 densch: and when inside, it starts flying to the left
 densch: well and the constant -20 rotation belongs to the case that should used when INSIDE the target area, not when outside
 densch: I should probably use soem else statements, maybe it solves stuff
 densch: yup, it definietely uses the last case for it. changed the -20 to -34 there and sure enough, the ship flies right at -34 rotation
 Westicles: Figuring it out will be a wonderful voyage of discovery
 densch: what confuses me too:the initialization input tells me that the target area has 2000&lt;x&lt;3500.
 densch: and from letting it play out, the ship start at x=2500
 densch: so lotically it should be in the target range from the very start
 densch: but looking at the map, in the first test case, it starts far left of it
 densch: I feel like I am messing up x and y coordinates at some point or something stupid like that!&#160;:-D
 RoboStac: the input in the statement is just an example - each test has a different landing area and you need to work it out from the input
 Scarfield: you are at least getting the landing area wrong, which will make your pod fly weird when looking at the replay, and also what robo says
 densch: I gotta read a bit more into this, seems like I dont get it yet&#160;:-)
 Westicles: Maybe the units are throwing you off?  They use some weird system of distance measure
 Scarfield: how do you determine the landing area?
 BlaiseEbuth: landfield
 Scarfield: GlazEbuth
 MSmits: struct, i didnt bother using multiple cores. I am bottlenecked by cache
 StevensGino: Hello guys,
 StevensGino: I am trying to use BrutalTest
 StevensGino: but it seems that the result on BrutalTest is quite weird
 StevensGino: I make a dummy AI of UTTT 
 StevensGino: on CG they the same code keep win/lose on different condition -&gt; but in Brutal test they are just win all for player1 all the time
 BlaiseEbuth: Love GlazEbuth... I feel shiny and chromed! :sunglasses:
 Scarfield: densch these are the surface points i get from the input in the first testcase of episode 2:Surface Points: [(0, 100), (1000, 500), (1500, 1500), (3000, 1000), (4000, 150), (5500, 150), (6999, 800)]
 Scarfield: you are definately doing something weird with the first input
 StevensGino: actually the CG is the one which is weird as my code don't have any random behavior so the game result should be consistent  instead ...
 StevensGino: now I am confuse all the ways
 Scarfield: nice Blaise, your name is not always as easy to make silly nicks from as others
 BlaiseEbuth: Probably player2 does not like to be brutalized...
 StevensGino: I mean brutal is correct as my code have determine behavior
 StevensGino: but on CG the result vary
 BlaiseEbuth: -&gt; fixed seed on the local referee version
 Westicles: euler used to answer all these questions.  maybe we can convince him to have office hours a couple times a week
 BlaiseEbuth: Or to write a FAQ
 densch: @garfield: I though they were given in the initialization inputs? otherwise I am not sure how to do it as the landx and landy in the code gets overwritten for eahc new point
 BlaiseEbuth: garfield :rofl:
 densch: oh, so that might be my issue then, I kind of thought it was always the same surface&#160;:-D
 Scarfield: they are given as init input, you need to store them, in an array or however you decide
 densch: oh okay
 densch: gues I'll do 2 arrays, one for the x and one for the y values
 Scarfield: but the numbers  2000&lt;x&lt;3500 you mentioned doesnt match the numbers i get from test case 1, so you have done something wrong there
 Westicles: he was using the example
 densch: well, yeah, I didnt read in anything, I kind of took the numbers from the text, thinking these example numbers were the ones 
 Scarfield: btw you dont need @ to ping someone, and there is autocomplete: sca-&gt; tab
 Scarfield: ooh, yea they are not&#160;:)
 jacek: marsfield
 Scarfield: mellowCek
 BlaiseEbuth: fluffield
 Scarfield: its soo FLUFFY!
 Westicles: All right, my turn.  Somebody give me a hint how you get at multi code when it is set to no download
 jacek: or all bosses
 BlaiseEbuth: You don't?
 Scarfield: you mean ref code? maybe check authors git if you know it
 StevensGino: I think the different between CG and brutaltest might come from some change of CG to avoid hard code
 eulerscheZahl: Westicles here are some official referees: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/tree/master/Referees">https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/tree/master/Referees</a>

 struct: I meant miniboards
 BrunoFelthes: why do you need it struct?
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: are these unique in terms of symmetry?
 struct: im not taking into account symmetry
 struct: BrunoFelthes to check if the board can still be won by either player
 MSmits: if i rotate the top one to the right
 MSmits: clockwise
 MSmits: i get a new state that is unwinnable right;
 MSmits: is it in that list?
 struct: yes
 kovi: i generate it in 1st sec, simply by "trying"
 struct: What do you mean kovi?
 BrunoFelthes: i do it too
 BrunoFelthes: at the first turn, just check all possible miniboard states, and store the result at an array... So, just get you miniboard bitset at the array to get the result...
 MSmits: struct I found one thats not in there
 MSmits: |X|O|X||X|_|O||O|X|O|
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's like 100 of them not there
 MSmits: yeah i assume
 MSmits: but only need one to disprove the claim&#160;:)
 struct: 100?
 struct: I get 40 at most
 struct: I guess I could do lookup
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rotate all 20 ...that's another 60.  mirror them...that's gotta be 120 total
 struct: Im currently doing (hasPlayerWon(a | (511 ^ b)) || hasPlayerWon(b | (511 ^ a))
 MSmits: well all you need to do is count from 0 to 19683 ternary, convert to binary,   then take each board. Fill them with crosses, see if cross wins. Then fill them with O's, see if O wins, if both are no, it's unwinnable
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i did that...let me find the output
 MSmits: struct, if you go 18 bit, then you're looping over 200k states or something
 MSmits: most of which are impossible
 Scarfield: only 1 players pieces matter, if there is no room for a winning line between opponent pieces, that board is unwinnable
 densch: thank god, I finally god it! :O getting the landing area components was a bigger PITA thatn I had expected
 jacek: :tada:
 StevensGino: do we have a book/blog that I can learn about MCTS, beam search, miniMax ...

 MSmits: ignore the ternary thing
 MSmits: variant thing i mean
 MSmits: TERNARY_MAX = 19683;
 MSmits: loop 0 to &lt; TERNARY_MAX 
 MSmits: then convert to binary

 jacek: if UTTT, then MCTS is primary choice
 MSmits: oh and for ternary you need:
 MSmits: const uint16_t triMoves[9] = { 1,3,9,27,81,243,729,2187,6561 };
 MSmits: thats all you need for your check i think sturct
 MSmits: struct
 struct: thanks, ill try
 MSmits: just ignore that variant thing. I am using 3 different state representations in that one function lol
 MSmits: binary, ternary and my weird one
 kovi: hmm, is there any draw pos with less than 4-4 pieces?
 MSmits: hmm

 MSmits: nah seems impossible kovi. I remember trying to find an example of this before.  Only boards that have 1 empty can be unwinnable
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpMvS1Q1sos">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpMvS1Q1sos</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The large UTT board there are 174k possible states ... so I calculated how many possible wins from that position .. oh nvrmnd... i compressed the results into a linear lookup for each player to give me like a&#160;% chance of winning moving forward ... because my MCTS couldn't search enough states to give good data... my bot still sucks, so i moved on
 MSmits: yeah PatrickMcGinnisII, to have a shot with php at a reasonable rank, you may have to train a NN locally&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I was random simming until the next small board was won, then I knew what my chances were from there...i never quite got it working right without searching 81! games
 jacek: have you lost some bet trying to do everything in php
 BrunoFelthes: MSmits, I'm trying to understand how to train a local NN, i watched a lot of videos about how alpha zero works, But i still dont know how to connect things... Do you recommend any hands on material, that i can apply here?  
 BrunoFelthes: jacek, are you using NN too, no?
 kovi: recu, robo and jace using nn
 jacek: eeyup
 BrunoFelthes: how did you learned about it? Any steps to follow?
 Westicles: Andrew Ng class?
 jacek: im self-taught, various places, random articles or blogs
 jacek: yeah i did some lessons from andrew ng machine learning in coursera
 jacek: some people here recommended learning neural network from scratch in python book
 jacek: and/or videos <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI</a>
 jacek: as to where to use NN, i treat NN as extended eval. at first i used it as replacement for hand-crafted eval in minimax. now im using it in mcts-like fashion
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://nnfs.io/">https://nnfs.io/</a>
 kovi: jacek, you still value only?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b3c07270-704d-4e1d-af3b-e93b6ecc5b9b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b3c07270-704d-4e1d-af3b-e93b6ecc5b9b</a>
 jacek: kovi yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: What's everyone's longest coding binge?  or average when a contest starts?  30 hours is about my max using CG.  I may go a little longer on personal projects.
 struct: 30 hours straight?
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII nods</b></p><p><img src="/a/61418101984360" /> struct: Max I can do is 4 hours
 struct: And I think its high
 struct: maybe it less than 4
 PatrickMcGinnisII: struct I wouldn't have guessed with your skillz
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap i gtg
 struct: cya
 eulerscheZahl: for concentrated working i'm with struct, 4h sounds like the upper limit until I get unproductive
 struct: How did codeforces go?
 eulerscheZahl: when I try to force it and continue, it's rarely without any measurable success
 eulerscheZahl: oh, I gave up on CF&#160;:/
 jacek: that means you both cant afford cocaine
 eulerscheZahl: solved the first 3, the rest was too hard
 eulerscheZahl: and found some newbies with a faulty A
 eulerscheZahl: codeforces has some weak pre-tests. and allows you to see other solutions and spot mistakes
 eulerscheZahl: they call it "hacking", gives bonus points if you do that
 struct: lol
 reCurse: My peak is probably around 12-16h but it's not sustainable over a long period
 eulerscheZahl: it would only make sense at the end of the contest when the deadline is near
 eulerscheZahl: but at that point i ran out of ideas already. so no reason to keep going
 eulerscheZahl: and early in the contest a break is worth more than the extended session
 reCurse: Makes sense, not so much for me though
 reCurse: During a contest I'd rather try as much stuff as humanely possible
 eulerscheZahl: as you still have ideas at the end
 reCurse: I won twice largely because of the last day or two pretty much coding / sleeping
 reCurse: shrug
 eulerscheZahl: did that on the codeforces marathon, 4 days and no relevant offline tests force you to submit random ideas and see what happens
 eulerscheZahl: i remember your CotC post mortem where you wrote about that. the efforts of the last day
 eulerscheZahl: and I remember your late takeover on CoIaF
 reCurse: Exactly
 reCurse: Then I'm burned out the next couple weeks :P
 eulerscheZahl: i also feel this post contest void. but surely not as intense as you
 reCurse: I love this feeling though. Not the burnout, but the 100% focus trying to make something work
 kovi: go with the flow...while there are ideas, and motivation...16+ hours can work
 reCurse: Little universe where nothing else matters for a few days
 kovi: ^
 eulerscheZahl: during the contest i like it too, especially the first few days. when i wake up at 5am, not tired at all and full of ideas to implement
 eulerscheZahl: after contest i'm so unproductive
 MSmits: me too normally, but did not last very long this time. I think maybe I don't try as hard as I used to 
 kovi: and you have your pet games anyway to improve on
 eulerscheZahl: same, somehow my passion is declining a bit over the years
 MSmits: mine just shifted away from contests
 MSmits: I'll still join them all, but it's less important
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if the games are at fault or it's just not something new and special to me anymore
 jacek: andropause eh
 eulerscheZahl: and when I write code at work already, i'm less motivated too. I noticed when i was a student working in midterms
 MSmits: maybe you'll be more motivated when life gets back to normal and you can play soccer again
 jacek: at least you can play one on paper
 MSmits: or some other physical exercise
 MSmits: lol..
 reCurse: It's perfectly normal to be less motivated as time goes on
 eulerscheZahl: i'm doing smaller walks in the park or bicycle trips not to get completely out of shape. still not the same as it used to be
 kovi: recurse: especially if you repeatedly beat everyone...
 eulerscheZahl: when the SDK came, it was something new to try again
 MSmits: kovi who is this demotivating for :P
 kovi: we still have more motivation to catch you sometimes
 reCurse: That wasn't my point at all :P
 eulerscheZahl: reCurse, the tourist of CG
 Marchete: euler getting oldie
 MSmits: this last contest was a bad example though, reCurse was doing something completely new
 MSmits: if he'd done a normal bot  he would have been far less motivated i think
 kovi: true
 MSmits: could have failed spectacularly, so seems exciting to me
 Westicles: you still can't play soccer?  that's crazy
 eulerscheZahl: i can. with 1 person from another household
 struct: damn
 reCurse:&#160;:(
 struct: Here we can play soccer as long as it is in open space
 Westicles: They actually enforce it?  Even when there were rules here they never enforced it
 eulerscheZahl: at least the vaccine is in sight, somewhat
 jacek: havent you seen soccer police?
 eulerscheZahl: my employer wants to vaccinate. planned start is in 8 days
 Westicles: I would just do it anyhow.  There are limits to conformity
 MSmits: thats weird.... doesnt this go by age? What does you employer have to do with it
 reCurse: :roll_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: there's still the risk of getting the covid these days. which i don't want to take
 jacek: oO
 reCurse: Because conformity is what it's all about...
 eulerscheZahl: the prioritization doesn't exist any longer 
 MSmits: yes but who decides who gets the vaccin?
 eulerscheZahl: now everyone can get the vaccine. if there are enough available
 eulerscheZahl: luck decides
 Westicles: It is about a bunch of things, but no about getting sick.  That is for sure
 MSmits: this seems a bit unfair
 reCurse: lol
 reCurse: You're right, it's all a hoax, no one got sick
 reCurse: It's all about 5G
 eulerscheZahl: so the employer will buy some. which is my biggest chance atm
 jacek: huh? you dont get vaccinated by gov?
 MSmits: i thought things were handled well in Germany, this seems messy
 eulerscheZahl: that too. but slow progress there
 MSmits: we are slow on vaccination, but at least there are a good set of rules for who goes first
 Westicles: reCurse, it isn't worth arguing about at this point.  just wait for the postmortems in 5 years
 reCurse: Sure
 MSmits: as if the fake news will be gone in 5 years lol
 MSmits: people will still believe the same :poop: they do now
 MSmits: evidence doesn't seem to matter to some 
 MSmits: nor science
 reCurse: Just sick of paying for all those 'muh freedom' types
 eulerscheZahl: we have 40% with 1 vaccination and 15% with their 2nd dose already, just looked it up
 MSmits: same, but can't do much about it
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl dont think it's far from that here
 MSmits: but we still go by age
 eulerscheZahl: not even sure if that's from all the population or just adults. probably the latter
 MSmits: I should be up in a few weeks
 eulerscheZahl: you are a teacher. that would put you higher on the list here
 MSmits: not here
 MSmits: teachers did not get priority
 MSmits: health workers did
 1457162: In my country percent vacination is slighly smaller tan EU average but we have much smaller percentage for older (70+ and 80+) people. It is due to goverment strategy. They simpply said - from today people x+ gan start sign for vacination
 MSmits: so no prioritization at all
 1457162: It is good for young people - but not good for old people. They are usually less mobile, less technology user. Even phone can be problem for them
 MSmits: I'm actually not sure if it is better to vaccinate older people first. They are more at risk, but they also spread the virus less. A young person vaccinated spreads a lot less virus.
 Westicles: Here they are begging people to bring in their 12 year olds, but mostly just shutting down because nobody is showing up anymore
 <b>**eulerscheZahl still doesn't have a mobile phone</b></p><p><img src="/a/63052365393434" /> jacek: Oo
 1457162: So now gov tell - older people do not sign so be start vacination even 20+ people
 Scarfield: dk just started prioritizing young people together with old people for that reason
 MSmits: Westicles thats also because around 30% of your country believes conspiracy theories and is scientifically illiterate
 MSmits: they wont even get vaccinated
 MSmits: because they think it has chips
 MSmits: or there is no virus
 jacek: and fish
 MSmits: lol...
 nitekat: in my country older people spread more virus than young ones....
 Westicles: MSmits, that is your opinion
 MSmits: it's not an opinion
 MSmits: it's a well known fact that a very large portion of the US thinks this way
 reCurse: Facts and US, be careful
 Scarfield: thats just what they want you to think
 MSmits: good point reCurse
 MSmits: in the US they are paying people to get vaccinated
 MSmits: lotteries and such
 Westicles: We seem to be the only ones looking at comorbidity stats.  It isn't rocket science
 MSmits: what exactly do you mean by comorbidity
 jacek: obesity?
 MSmits: yeah, if people are unhealthy they die more easily from covid
 MSmits: kinda late to do something about that in the middle of a pandemic
 Westicles: Like I said, not worth fighting over.  It is too tied up with politics, and this is a very left leaning crowd
 MSmits: only in the US is this a left/right issue
 MSmits: in the rest of the world it is just an issue
 1457162: Currently is dure that it is only 2 options - you will be vacinated or you will be ill - meybe in month, maybe in the yeat - but for sure you will be
 reCurse: You're right all debates can be projected to a single dimension
 Westicles: You guys don't have a right :P
 MSmits: we have a right, they are even in power
 reCurse: Left and right
 reCurse: The theory of binary politics
 jacek: 1d convolution
 MSmits: in most of the world, covid was actually a uniting factor, as long as it wasnt mishandled by the government
 jacek: united against government
 kovi: while i like the analysis of post-cg-contest more than post-covid...we already can have a kind of pb4 stats on that<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid">https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid</a>
 MSmits: leades that did well with it got reelected is what i mean
 jacek: pb4?
 MSmits: leaders
 1415495: sad fact: the excess mortality of the US compared to the EU pre-covid is the same order that the excess mortality due to covid (in the US)
 densch: Hi just a quick question: is it normal to take ages to beat mars lader episode 2 or am I jsut too dumb for everything?&#160;:-/
 densch: I'm on this for like the last 3 hours or so
 reCurse: Difficulty is a ladder
 jacek: i havent done mars lander 2 myself anyway
 MSmits: fenrir do you mean as many people died in EU as in the US, relatively?
 densch: trying all kinds of conditional stuff, basing the ifs on hspeed, distance from mid point, etc
 kovi: pb4 stat - as its more fair than trueskill (covid death rate)
 1415495: I mean that if you ignore the covid, the US already has a higher mortality then average EU
 reCurse: lol
 MSmits: ohhh yeah
 MSmits: thats true
 MSmits: life expectancy has gone down in the US
 Westicles: Very different racial makeup
 1415495: and the mortality added by covid to the US is of the samerange order
 eulerscheZahl: but we need guns! they keep us safe
 kovi: westicles and age combo
 1415495: it's more due to poor health, prevention and environment from what I remember
 MSmits: Westicles it's more about living conditions
 MSmits: and having access to health care
 MSmits: which is not guaranteed in the US
 Westicles: What do you mean?  Obamacare is manditory
 MSmits: from what i understand that's a poor man's health care plan to what we get here
 MSmits: compared to
 eulerscheZahl: isn't Obamacare still less than European standard?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but was a great improvement for the poor in the US anyways
 1415495: yes way lower than average EU (or event worse EU I think, but need to check)
 Westicles: Lots of education needed here.  I better get started on a newsletter for you folks
 1415495: for twice the GDP spending
 Westicles: The US has the greatest healthcare system in the world, and it isn't even close
 eulerscheZahl: does anyone still have the icebox website link?
 MSmits: Westicles sure if you've got $$$
 Westicles: Nah, poor folks get free care.  Same as always
 reCurse: Alright I'll be back in an hour or two
 1415495: can you find exceptionnal health care if you have the resource, yes, does it have an average good health care, no
 MSmits: I'll stop reCurse&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: good choice reCurse, see you
 MSmits: got carried away sorry
 jacek: hmm? another book?
 BlaiseEbuth: Take your time.
 Westicles: Anyhow, you should go play soccer.  It'll be fine
 eulerscheZahl: and of course tourist won on codeforces again
 struct: I couldnt make it
 eulerscheZahl: this morning he won a laptop. and then a PS5 in the afternoon
 Scarfield: :o
 MSmits: nice
 kovi: lets switch topic to cg....the movement genertion of dice duel is definitely much harder than other boardgames
 eulerscheZahl: i was thinking about giving a list of possible moves
 BlaiseEbuth: He won the laptop and thought he need a support for it. So he won the ps5
 eulerscheZahl: but the list can get pretty big
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl it's somewhat customary, but not all games give out possible moves
 MSmits: imagine the list for Amazons
 MSmits: or gitc
 MSmits: so if it's not practical... don't
 struct: I dont give the moves but give the number of moves
 eulerscheZahl: but for dice duel it's not that straight forward to generate
 jacek: well there is always "random" option
 eulerscheZahl: why the number? to help debugging?
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: meh, too late. it's released already. won't break any bots
 MSmits: yeah dont do that
 MSmits: doesnt seem like a starter game anyways
 jacek: approvers didnt complain
 kovi: true
 kovi: actually i didnt meant it a complaint for starters. it is a problem with slow play/rollout
 MSmits: hmm, well you dont have to use mcts
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't understand it as a complaint
 jacek: you have to write it your own, as with all games
 eulerscheZahl: just telling that i was thinking about it
 jacek: (or copy for HS)
 eulerscheZahl: giving the list makes it easier to enter the game
 eulerscheZahl: check for captures, print that move
 MSmits: btw, the game looks very cool
 eulerscheZahl: laggy for some users
 jacek: be careful, it may mess up with your meta
 eulerscheZahl: zarthaxx's girlfriend still working on replacement assets for the dice
 kovi: it is very cool!and actually now i understood the motivation for 3d
 eulerscheZahl: makes it easier to understand what's going on
 eulerscheZahl: I had that game on my list for quite some time already
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/789/focus">https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/789/focus</a>this one might be interesting too
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't put too much efforts into it... Only 5% of the users will take a look to it. An 5% of them will code something...
 MSmits: my meta isn't running jacek, just 1 core and a lot of RAM action to make endgame books :P
 MSmits: dont dare to do anthing else
 eulerscheZahl: fair point BlaiseEbuth. but i don't want a laggy game
 kovi: anyway...back to my original issue...i wonder how bitboarding could work on this
 struct: disabling antialias didnt help?
 eulerscheZahl: it's disabled by default
 struct: or was it disabled by default?
 struct: ah right
 struct: I remember now
 eulerscheZahl: i could try a smaller drawing area
 Westicles: Did you just make it up, or is it based on something?
 eulerscheZahl: and then scale it up to fullscreen
 MSmits: kovi not sure how to do it here
 eulerscheZahl: dice duel is based on "Würfelschach"
 eulerscheZahl: same movement rules
 eulerscheZahl: but you have to get 3 dice in a row with consecutive numbers showing up (2 of yours, 1 opponent die)
 eulerscheZahl: no capturing at all in the original game
 eulerscheZahl: felt much harder to enter and easier to sabotage than play properly so I decided against the original rules
 eulerscheZahl: CG rankings final, finished 405. not even as bad as I thought it was
 BlaiseEbuth: Zarthou is an asocial geek, he does not have a girlfriend... You will wait a long time for your assets...
 eulerscheZahl: he gave me some already
 eulerscheZahl: i tried them: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/468472307279724565/846747131494400030/unknown.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/468472307279724565/846747131494400030/unknown.png</a>
 MSmits: kovi, for this game I would use lookupArrays with lists of possible endpositions and orientations of the dice. 
 MSmits: so as index, you use the cell of the board (64) and the orientation of the dice
 eulerscheZahl: but your path might be block by other dice for extra fun
 MSmits: yeah, it needs some extra checking
 eulerscheZahl: extra long for path travelled
 MSmits: but pretty sure this can be dealt with  in a lookup array. It's up to you how much info you want to include
 eulerscheZahl: and &amp; it with currently set dice
 kovi: msmits: i did exactly that
 MSmits: ahh ok, cool
 eulerscheZahl: I didn't.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Dice-Duel/blob/master/config/level2/Boss.cs">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Dice-Duel/blob/master/config/level2/Boss.cs</a>
 MSmits: nah, you should not do crazy stuff like that in  a referee eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: that's the boss
 MSmits: but the boss needs to be a reasonable test of the game also
 eulerscheZahl: with the legendary for-switch construct<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Dice-Duel/blob/master/config/level2/Boss.cs#L113-L116">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Dice-Duel/blob/master/config/level2/Boss.cs#L113-L116</a>
 MSmits: you dont want to complicate things
 MSmits: those are fine eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 MSmits: I do this a lot. Just write out all possibilities. If you write duplicate code, can always make it smarter later on
 eulerscheZahl: inspired by <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://thedailywtf.com/articles/Switched_on_Loops">https://thedailywtf.com/articles/Switched_on_Loops</a>
 MSmits: this looks a bit BFS-like
 MSmits: or maybe DFS
 MSmits: ye it's DFS
 MSmits: for case paradigm :P
 MSmits: this just seems weird
 eulerscheZahl: the site collects bad code samples
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: so this is where you go for inspiration huh&#160;:)
 struct: lets hope they dont get hans on my code
 struct: hands*
 MSmits: or mine... 
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i make a mess too. depends on my current mood
 eulerscheZahl: at least for contests. at work I try to avoid it :P
 Scarfield: when i started c++ and making the first mcts, i had a problem of printing uint8_t. Made a funtion that looped until the iterator was equal to the uint8 i wanted to print xD
 struct: :D
 MSmits: you mean as opposed to to_string()&#160;?
 struct: you can do (int)a
 struct: to print it
 MSmits: interesting solution&#160;:)
 Scarfield: yes or 0+
 Scarfield: i mean i just started c++ :p
 MSmits: I still dont fully understand what c++ does with characters and strings
 MSmits: i often run into this and just google some code
 MSmits: earlier I had a situation where a filename had to be a const char* instead of a string
 MSmits: I dont really know the difference but found some code
 MSmits: C# does not have this weirdness
 eulerscheZahl: that codeforces round with the "hacking" gave me some weird code today
 eulerscheZahl: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1523/submission/117900845">https://codeforces.com/contest/1523/submission/117900845</a>
 MSmits: ohh that looks like my first vba code!
 eulerscheZahl: my solution for comparison: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1523/submission/117875387">https://codeforces.com/contest/1523/submission/117875387</a>
 MSmits: I could not read that either when i got back to it
 eulerscheZahl: (i didn't try to code it in the most efficient way, just solved the problem within 5min and made sure it would pass)
 Scarfield: "FOD"&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: #define FOD(i,r,l) for (ll i=r;i&gt;=l;i--)
 Scarfield: ah
 eulerscheZahl: these pragmas are too common on codeforces
 eulerscheZahl: make it unreadable just to type 2 less characters
 struct: my There is No spoon code is messy too
 struct: one of my worst codes
 struct: It was when I started on cg
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/93de8f72-ee53-44b7-bcd6-94c8b6af94fd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/93de8f72-ee53-44b7-bcd6-94c8b6af94fd</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think that I have to read it to get an impression
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl your code is sooo much better
 MSmits: that other guy may have been able to type it faster or something... but you're going to get bugs you cant easily fix
 eulerscheZahl: comparing C# with C++ isn't totally fair
 MSmits: ofc... but you need to be able to read your own code 
 BlaiseEbuth: What an insult for C++...
 eulerscheZahl: i thought his was wrong but it worked in the end. I lost 50 points on this bet
 struct: This was for A test right?
 MSmits: why did yoy lose points on a bet?
 eulerscheZahl: CF works like this: you submit your solution, then lock it (so you can't change it anymore)
 eulerscheZahl: then you can see code of other players
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: CF only does a pre-test which doesn't check all corner cases (such as runtime)
 eulerscheZahl: then the system tests are more robust
 eulerscheZahl: so i had the impression that I could trigger a timeout. if you succeed, you get 100 points
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise you lose 50
 MSmits: trigger a timeout?
 Scarfield: ^
 MSmits: timeout is a good thing?
 eulerscheZahl: it's good if i find a bug in the solution of someone else
 MSmits: oh, I see
 eulerscheZahl: i give an input file. which is executed on that program
 densch: hey, is somewone here good at math? 
 MSmits: what a weird contest
 MSmits: somewhat densch
 Scarfield: xD
 eulerscheZahl: that's the normal codeforces format
 eulerscheZahl: but a bit unfair:
 MSmits: yeah, I am saying codeforces is weird. But cool&#160;:)
 densch: I am still struggling with the mars lander 2&#160;:-D
 densch: so i changed my idea
 densch: maybe I should go vectorwise
 MSmits: ahh. Solved that a long time ago, not sure i am much help
 eulerscheZahl: there are "rooms" to avoid creating fake accounts and feeding your main with wrong solutions that can be hacked
 eulerscheZahl: and depending on who's in your room, you can hack some more or less
 MSmits: I see
 eulerscheZahl: and also if someone else in your room tries the same, only the first attempt gets the credits
 MSmits: so.. luck factor
 densch: I want to use the angle between hspeed and vspeed to determine the  direction of the neeeded rotation
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: yet tourist always wins?
 eulerscheZahl: mostly :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1523/standings">https://codeforces.com/contest/1523/standings</a>
 MSmits: that lucky bugger
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1524/standings">https://codeforces.com/contest/1524/standings</a>here he was 2nd "only"
 eulerscheZahl: but same prize for top4, so it didn't matter
 MSmits: densch sure you can do that
 MSmits: wait, isnt the velocity independent of the angle of rotation?
 MSmits: as in... you can be moving to the left, yet be rotated the wrong way
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/90b2faee-948e-4861-9e0d-5d921b362460">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/90b2faee-948e-4861-9e0d-5d921b362460</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's how physics work in that game
 MSmits: btw Marslander2 took me several days, wheras other puzzles of the same difficulty took me less than an hour
 jacek: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: i solved marslander 3 before 2 :D
 MSmits: yeah, you did a GA right/
 MSmits: with pictures and all that
 MSmits: I never solved M3
 eulerscheZahl: tried to make my sim find the path. gave up and used if-else for starters and evolve from that
 struct: No NNs for mars landers yet?
 densch: MSmits well, yeah, for a given set of hspeed and vspeed, I first wanna calculate the perfect rotation.
 MSmits: ok
 densch: MSmits said rotation is basically pointed directly opposite to the direction of the (hspeed,vspeed) vector
 MSmits: mmh no
 MSmits: rotation determines the force
 MSmits: not the velocity
 densch: and of course, cause we have the damn 15 degree max change thing, I then gotta rotate my ship mqax 15 degress twards that target angle
 eulerscheZahl: the formula i shared above should give a good understanding how the game works
 eulerscheZahl: warning: you get integers as input for the speed. internally the game uses doubles all the time, without rounding
 eulerscheZahl: same for position. all doubles
 eulerscheZahl: evil codingame
 eulerscheZahl: afk dinner time
 jacek: at 20?
 densch: I dont know . at least I wanna try that idea since I have no idea how to manage testcase 2 where you have initially hspeed=-100, so you gotta accelerate in the opposite direction as soon as possible
 MSmits: densch basically my strategy was: Go up, move to landing spot, go down :P
 densch: my iniital idea for the frst case was:
 Scarfield: have you looked at test case 4 and 5 densch? :p
 densch: get some horizontal speed towards the middle of the map, then float till you are aorund there, then drop straight down.
 MSmits: I had this function:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2b530c2c-9106-410a-aada-aa61f8ba834b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2b530c2c-9106-410a-aada-aa61f8ba834b</a>
 densch: start dropping down as soon as the landing area is reached, so you make it in time  before leaving the other side
 densch: dumb way but it worked for the first case
 densch: well, then we got second case where the thing highspeed races from one side to the other... and I definitely needs to actively brake hard
 MSmits: basically, I defined a bunch of functions like accelerate, peakaltitude and others and made a bunch of if else
 MSmits: calibrated stuff on the test cases and hoped for the best
 densch: yeah, i dont know. i think the second episode is like really hard.
 MSmits: solution 290 lines, which i guess means it could be done in 100 or so :P
 MSmits: densch yes it sure is
 MSmits: i think it's classified as medium, but should be hard
 densch: in my mind I can kind of se the plan: move to the right till you are there, then start droppoing, then...
 MSmits: yeah thats what i do
 densch: but then, when actually doing the while thing, I have no idea how to make the game know "Yo, in this iteration of the while case, keep in mind that we are in "stage " 5 of the plan and do the corresponding stuff
 densch: ain't the mars episode 2 supposed to be an easy one? :O
 MSmits: well it's not
 densch: god, what are the middle and hard lessons then?&#160;:'O
 Scarfield: its easier than episode 3, but definately not easay
 densch: Adventurer, I'm terrified! :O
 MSmits: I would suggest doing more easy and medium puzzles, not htis one
 densch: wellm yeah, after hours of thinking, I am hungry. so I might work on it tomorrow again
 densch: for now I'd love to understand how to use the math.atan properly in my case
 Scarfield: oh its in medium section, definately one of the harder "mediums"
 MSmits: math.atan always makes my head hurt. I used it a lot in space engineers to target weapons. In 3D it's even worse
 densch: like, I literally dont get for which pos or negative hspeed or vspeed atan(hspeed/vspeed) will be positive or negative
 MSmits: yep thats the issue
 MSmits: basically I always tried all combinations until one worked :P
 jacek: use atan2 then
 densch: if I was programming at home, I would jsut print shit on the console. but here the sconsole is used as some sort of output, so that aint possible&#160;:-/
 jacek: you can print to error
 MSmits: ye print error
 densch: ...
 jacek: thats in the comments, isnt it
 densch: whats that again? i deleted that comment about it asap&#160;:-)
 MSmits: it is
 MSmits: which language&gt;/
 jacek: what lang
 densch: java
 MSmits: then i'm stumped
 jacek: System.err.println("dupa");
 densch: I dont know anything except java. and not even that any good
 densch: so: atan(+)=+, atan(-)=-
 densch: says the error thing
 Marchete: in 2 gens I have 80% winrate vs a random bot... at least is not &lt;55%
 jacek: :tada:
 Marchete: yeah, like these papers
 Marchete: "we achieve 80% winrate vs a greedy bot"
 Marchete: lol
 jacek: greedy?
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: they achieve high winrates vs lame bots
 Marchete: greedy or randoms
 Marchete: but this thing is way too hard
 jacek: but progress is a progress
 jacek: will it improve?
 Marchete: gen1 -&gt; 39% winrate vs gen0
 Marchete: gen1 -&gt; 70% vs gen0
 Marchete: i have no damn idea
 jacek: gen1 39%? hmm
 Marchete: it's only a single layer
 Marchete: I know
 jacek: mine is also single layer
 jacek: most my bots are single layer, few have just 2 layers
 Marchete: 64 dense
 Marchete: 80k weights
 Marchete: 80KB
 Marchete: 22k weights
 jacek: 64 units and 80k weights?
 Scarfield: why limit nodes to only have one connection? :p
 Marchete: nahh that doesn't work at all
 Marchete: 40% winrate now
 jacek: i remeber my 1 iteration give ~90% vs random
 Marchete: as it should be
 densch: hey, anyone know if one can somehow save the current code from a challenge? like I dont wanna 
 densch: do the mars 2 anymore and do something else but wanna keep that cide I got so far for it
 Marchete: I'm playing 1000 selfplay games and picking 100k samples from last 3M samples
 Scarfield: when you run a testcase or submit your code will be saved, copy paste it somewhere if you want to feel safe
 Marchete: seems right?
 Marchete: then
 Marchete: K_LEARNING_RATE=0.001K_BATCH_SIZE=64K_EPOCHS=100
 jacek: huh?
 jacek: what does epoch mean in this context. the learning thing?
 Marchete: I have no damn idea :D
 jacek: i use 2-3 epochs over entire memory buffer every iteration
 jacek: 1 epoch meaning going through all dataset
 Marchete: entire memory buffer are all moves?
 jacek: memory buffer, a list of positions and their labels
 jacek: if youre using policy, that could be moves as well
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: all?
 Marchete: I'm picking a random subset
 jacek: a0 folks use random subset, i use all. thats one of difference
 jacek: my method may be confusing, its heavily inspired by a0 but not exact
 Marchete: it's not confusing
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: full buffer makes sense
 Marchete: a random subset will miss most of the info
 Marchete: and I doubt it can go to 90% winrate
 reCurse: Digging down the chess move generation best algorithms, I realize our average bitboard usage here is kindergarten level :P
 MSmits: jacek do you split between a training set and test/validation set?
 MSmits: or does that not make sens
 jacek: does not make sense i think
 MSmits: oh noes, reCurse, dont do it
 jacek: reCurse kindergarten bitboards?
 reCurse: Is that related to fancy magic bitboards
 MSmits: I mean oh noes... the rabbit hole
 reCurse: This stuff is borderline insane
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Kindergarten_Bitboards">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Kindergarten_Bitboards</a>
 jacek: and here is 'classical' and magic bitboards <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://rhysre.net/fast-chess-move-generation-with-magic-bitboards.html">https://rhysre.net/fast-chess-move-generation-with-magic-bitboards.html</a>
 Marchete: that's not kindergarten level, my toddler can't do that!
 MSmits: not when you're watching 
 reCurse: I guess my analogy was very poor considering 'kindergarten bitboards' are a thing :P
 reCurse: So baby level then
 reCurse: Aren't kindergarten bitboards a different thing than fancy magic bitboards?
 reCurse: I don't want to get lost, only focus on the sota
 Scarfield: lol the rhysre link, links to his github, where he called his bot Shallow Blue
 jacek: i only know kindergarten for name
 jacek: i only use the classical approach
 Marchete: we lost him to the chess blackhole!
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yh.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/nno0b3/the_admin_of_a_40k_supernatural_conspiracy_theory/">https://yh.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/nno0b3/the_admin_of_a_40k_supernatural_conspiracy_theory/</a>
 Marchete: saw that, classic conspiranoics
 MSmits: well the bishops are obvious
 Marchete: like vaccines working?
 reCurse: lol not even bothering capturing pieces
 MSmits: no i meant the chess postion
 MSmits: all bishops on black
 MSmits: dunno about the rest, but pawn structure is craz
 MSmits: y
 reCurse: Well you can derive a lot of impossibilities from the fact nothing's captured
 Scarfield: they are playing a special variation of Fischer chess
 struct: damn -9 for black
 struct: this is clearly winning
 jacek: like left white rook
 kovi: what recurse said. both bishops and pawn impossible because of that
 MSmits: do you mean impossible, because a real play would capture stuff, or completely impossible because there is no series of legal moves
 MSmits: real player
 reCurse: Why not both
 MSmits: no idea, just wondering about the question
 MSmits: it's poorly defined&#160;:)
 reCurse: I mostly meant legally impossible
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: But having that crowded of a board in mid-game is quite something
 kovi: double bishop = pawn-&gt;bishoppawn outofcolumn = capture
 MSmits: yeah that rook has to take quite a tour to get there
 Marchete: put it on stockfish, it will explode
 jacek: reCurse so by kindergarten you meant we are newbies? not the bitboard type?
 kovi: yes
 MSmits: that's what he was saying but it was the inclusive we
 MSmits: he's just surprised by the level of ingenuity in chess bitboard
 jacek: shall be the royal we
 MSmits: :P
 kovi: they are doing it for decades...
 MSmits: yeah, that magic number stuff is cool though
 jacek: uh oh
 MSmits: they actually mine those
 reCurse: I meant despite our bitboard efforts we are still nowhere near the effort these guys put
 MSmits: kinda
 MSmits: but reCurse that's also because we move on from games. Well most of us :p
 Marchete: chess is the most explored game probably
 reCurse: I know, it was just a tongue in cheek way of expressing admiration
 jacek: find other games with dedicated decades to efficient move generation
 Scarfield: minecraft
 MSmits: othello seemed pretty cool, it's a much simpler game than chess, but the AVX stuff is neat
 MSmits: and ofc minecraft yes
 reCurse: Wonder how much the decades helped given the changing hardware, kind of changes the goal posts a few times
 reCurse: "Just use 840kb precomputed table at initialization" is definitely era-specific
 kovi: good point. 35 years ago i wanted to do it on c64
 MSmits: 35 years ago I wanted icecream and transformers robots
 kovi: but the best i could actually do is smart greedy gomoku
 jacek: smart?
 jacek: also, limited hardware encouraged creativity
 reCurse: Sometimes wish I was older for that
 jacek: you always can limit your hardware ~
 Scarfield: not to late, there is no limit to self limitation
 reCurse: We know it's not the same thing
 kovi: motivation and especially knowledge  was different back then
 Scarfield: wait karlis o first in UTTT
 jacek: w00t
 Scarfield: submitted 18.15 today
 jrke: damn karliso also aving 1 point lead
 jacek: im too noob to detronize him
 jacek: NN autobots, get him!
 jacek: and still not 1st in onitama despite using onitama avatar :s
 Scarfield: thats dedication though
 reCurse: Maybe at this point I just need to accept I'll never catch a break at it
 jrke: jacek is your onitama bot NN
 jrke: 6 points lead a big one
 jrke: nice
 jacek: yes
 jacek: or just lucky start positions :v
 Illedan: NN in onitama? Do you have `NN-input for every kind of possible card?
 jacek: its card-agnostic. i have input for every square that is attacked by one player, or other player, or attacked by center card etc.
 Illedan: cool
 jacek: 320 states per square. the inputs over-parametrized as all of my NNs

 Astrobytes: hey struct
 ZarthaxX: hey
 Astrobytes: zarthooo
 ZarthaxX: astroooooooo
 Astrobytes: How's things?
 ZarthaxX: good
 ZarthaxX: tommorrow im having the job offer conditions and stuff
 ZarthaxX: pretty happy&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ah nice man!&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I've got an interview next week for a damn webdev job
 ZarthaxX: :O
 struct: at least they dont use foxpro
 ZarthaxX: nice tho&#160;:)
 struct: I hope :D
 ZarthaxX: hope it goes well
 Astrobytes: foxpro :D
 Astrobytes: Fucking Wordpress
 Astrobytes: Not gonna lie, I'll take anything right now
 Astrobytes: (but not foxpro)
 Astrobytes: But quite honestly I am not looking forward to brushing up my PHP and js knowledge tbh
 struct: some frameworks are not that bad
 ZarthaxX: php, no&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: It's a WordPress job
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes first dev job tho?
 Astrobytes: Excluding the last one I had around 1999-2001 yes
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: well
 ZarthaxX: i guess you gotta start somewhere
 Astrobytes: Though I did keep my hands in the pie over the years
 Astrobytes: I was going for testing jobs and a few said I was 'too skilled'
 Astrobytes: I am not entirely sure what kind of candidate they were looking for.
 struct: too skilled is bad?
 Astrobytes: For many jobs yes. "They'll leave as soon as they can" is the reason. I've done my time in hiring.
 Astrobytes: When I was studying and eventually quit my kitchen job, I tried to pick up a few hours at a TNT warehouse. I had to sit there for about 20 minutes trying to tell the guy that I just needed soem cash and I wasn't gonna suddenly leave or apply for his position.
 Astrobytes: I still don't get how ithis applied to me for the testing positions but  hey
 ZarthaxX: too skilled wtf
 struct: I had to google tnt warehouse
 struct: just to be sure
 ZarthaxX: lol i will google that too
 Astrobytes: Yeah, not an explosives factory :D
 ZarthaxX: haha
 ZarthaxX: i forgot you were a chef
 ZarthaxX: have you been doing any course related to programming?
 Astrobytes: I did a 'foundations of computer science' (discrete maths, lagos, data structures, complexity, proofs, all that crap) and a Java OOP course about 12 years agho
 Astrobytes: *ago
 Astrobytes: That got me started properly
 Astrobytes: *algos (lagos!!!)
 Astrobytes: Little bit out of date but I can prove myself.
 ZarthaxX: i see
 ZarthaxX: that seems enough
 Astrobytes: I mean I've done lots of online ones informally but that's the only formal ones
 ZarthaxX: but the time that has passed plays you a bad oen
 Astrobytes: Yes exactly
 struct: thats why it was dangerous, they havent updated java in 12 years
 struct: He would take their jobs
 Astrobytes: Hahahaha
 Astrobytes: That was the second worst course I ever took in my life btw
 Astrobytes: The absolute worst was a combined geology and weather module. Grim. Really, really grim.
 codin_compuder: i need help for this clash
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes my job involves learning java :D
 codin_compuder: HELP|||
 codin_compuder: The program: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/95760e24-8699-4424-8259-d1f0086e9528">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/95760e24-8699-4424-8259-d1f0086e9528</a>
 codin_compuder: i need help
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: It's hideous!
 Astrobytes: I mean, it works and stuff. But the goddamn verbosity.
 struct: the purpouse of the clash is for you to solve it
 struct: not us
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes ah okey, nice
 Astrobytes: I'm totally with reBless in that we need a bot that replies to these standard requests/questions/demands
 ZarthaxX: i dont know if the verbose part is what annoys me
 Astrobytes: There's a lot more yes
 ZarthaxX: but will see, i will try to see java with different eyes&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: also, i could start practicing with the multi creation haha
 struct: you better close them
 Astrobytes: Not EVERYTHING has to be a fking object
 ZarthaxX: why not
 ZarthaxX: :P
 Astrobytes: Right!
 Astrobytes: Honestly, I'm a fan of using the right paradigms for the right tasks
 ZarthaxX: i like the objects paradigm tho
 Astrobytes: Sure, where applicable
 ZarthaxX: at industriy lvl, seems right
 ZarthaxX: industry*
 Astrobytes: But when you're forced into that when you don't need it it's a little unwieldy
 Astrobytes: What I'm getting at is that there are a lot of problems that could be solved by not putting all faith in one methodology over another. (my early dev experience taught me A LOT. And still in touch with my creative lead and tech lead btw)
 densch: PRAISE THE SUN!
 densch: I finally, even though very narrowly beat the mars lander episode 2. it aint no good code, it could be way smarter or efficient but I dont care. it worked

 Astrobytes: Don't post your code
 densch: oh
 struct: free experience, ty
 Astrobytes: For debugging purposes it's cool but honestly, don't post working solutions please
 densch: sorry
 Astrobytes: don't worry, now you know
 Astrobytes: Not much of a challenge if everyone posts their solutions in the chat right&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes okey yes, being forced to something may not be the best, even more when you know what the correct choice would be
 ZarthaxX: but well, we are just slaves :D
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: Sadly very true!
 ZarthaxX: depends on the company values tho
 ZarthaxX: the one i got into now is known for being one of the best places to work in
 ZarthaxX: top 8 in the world apparently
 ZarthaxX: im pretty lucky haha
 Astrobytes: Smaller ones *sometimes* have better values. In my experience they do not :D
 Astrobytes: *Smaller companies that is
 Astrobytes: Get in there dude
 Astrobytes: We can talk shit here all we like but a good job is a good job right

 ArtMajor: Quick question. I was doing a reverse coc, and when I submitted with all test cases showing correct I got a 25%. Why?
 struct: bad testcases
 struct: validators are a bit different
 Andriamanitra: ideally the validators should be testing for the same thing but in a different way so hard-coded solutions won't pass but the reality is bit different
 Andriamanitra: people seem to rarely take a good look at test cases before approving new clashes so all kinds of crap slips through
 Andriamanitra: also the fact that it was a reverse and you got specifically 25% leads me to believe it was one of those reverse modes with only 4 test cases.. that's almost never enough for reverse mode
 ArtMajor: yeah there were only 4
 ArtMajor: what you said makes sense though

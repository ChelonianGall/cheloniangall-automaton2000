 GenesisWasTaken: testing stuff out on an alt account is within the rules right?
 NinjaDoggy: idk, i was banned before for it(on my alt)
 NinjaDoggy: but it's probably fine
 Zenoscave: your alt&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: just namei t differnetly
 NinjaDoggy: in UTTT
 NinjaDoggy: i got an email saying i was hogging legend spots and got it removed lol
 NinjaDoggy: I wasn't too discrete with the name though...
 GenesisWasTaken: why does it take so long to get out of wood league lol
 NinjaDoggy: NinjaDoggySmurf :thinking:
 GenesisWasTaken: is it because there are only 16 people insthis league lmao
 GenesisWasTaken: it takes forever for me to find 1 match
 NinjaDoggy: submits are slow right now
 NinjaDoggy: because servers are overloaded&#160;:(
 GenesisWasTaken: been sitting here for 10 minutes and I'm still at 50%
 NinjaDoggy: game's too popular
 elderlybeginner: what are the basic rules for utilizing learns in silver?
 NinjaDoggy: learn first 8
 NinjaDoggy: you can get top of gold with that still
 NinjaDoggy: my current bot learns index 0 for first 6
 elderlybeginner: any ratings for learns required
 LLG: I just learn until I have 8-10 spells, still trying to figure out the optimal number
 elderlybeginner:&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: no, learn first tome for 8 turns is pretty good
 LLG: I put higher weight on spells with 0 cost
 NinjaDoggy: was around top 30-40 gold today
 NinjaDoggy: with that still
 NinjaDoggy: you can also try to generate a value for each tome
 NinjaDoggy: and take highest value tome or something
 LLG: yeah that's what I do
 elderlybeginner: 5-6 learns at start works best for me, but still got stuck in silver and I am wondering where are my week points
 NinjaDoggy: probably searching algo
 NinjaDoggy: and python&#160;:(
 LLG: maybe your evaluation heuristics
 elderlybeginner: most certainly it's about heuristics
 LLG: I've seen people in gold with only about 5000 sims
 elderlybeginner: I don't rate learns and brews
 LLG: so it technically could work with good heuristics
 LLG: one thing you could do is optimize the end game
 LLG: like if you're at 5, and you can get to 6 before your opponent can brew a single potion
 LLG: that's a good target to rush
 LLG: or if they're at 5 and about to get 6
 NinjaDoggy: yea, end game optimization is pretty big
 LLG: you can try to cast spell and get bonus points for ingredients at the end
 NinjaDoggy: having 1 extra potion usually wins
 elderlybeginner: that would require to look into opponent
 LLG: you can just track the number of potions each side have brewed, for now
 Uemu: if you're at five and your score + the potion you will make is higher than opponent's score, rushing the sixth potion when the opponent is ahead is bad imo 
 elderlybeginner: i am usually first with 6 brews, but loosing with points
 LLG: yeah I only rush 6th if the 6th potion give me higher score than my opp.
 LLG: otherwise I look for the second closest, etc.
 LLG: until I find one
 LLG: if I can't find one I just optimize ingredients
 LLG: because you get 1 points for each tier2+ ingredients at the end
 Uemu: Oh the ingredient part is smart as hell
 GenesisWasTaken: I do search for both sides though
 GenesisWasTaken: so I have perfect information on which player can rush a potion first
 GenesisWasTaken: let's say, they're at 5, and there's no way I'm beating them to 6
 GenesisWasTaken: I'll optimize ingredients
 elderlybeginner: still you get more points by brewing 6th then by optimizing end-state with inventory
 Uemu: Yes but if you can't brew sixth before him stack ingredients 
 GenesisWasTaken: yeah that ^
 GenesisWasTaken: if I can't get to 6th before my opponent I stack ingredient
 elderlybeginner: I must have bigger heuristics weaknesses then that
 GenesisWasTaken: right now I just evaluate by point/turn
 GenesisWasTaken: I get the path to each potions, and divide their reward by the number of turns to reach it
 Zenoscave: GenesisWasTaken do you include current inventory in your eval?
 GenesisWasTaken: for example, I can brew a 20 points potion in 4 turns, that's 5 points a turn
 elderlybeginner: in general i'm going for "kill", just trying to brew asap and only rating casts
 GenesisWasTaken: I used to, but now I don't
 GenesisWasTaken: the only thing I evaluate is point/turn
 Zenoscave: Put it back. that's a big part. Just need to tune the eval
 GenesisWasTaken: then I have some heuristics to determine whether I can get to that potion before my opponent
 elderlybeginner: do you rate brews in regards to its ingredients usage?
 Zenoscave: yes
 elderlybeginner: kind of balance points/ingredients?
 Zenoscave: t0 &lt; t1 &lt; t2 &lt;t3
 GenesisWasTaken: well, the potion's reward IS based on it's ingredients
 GenesisWasTaken: but yeah, could be a thing to look into
 Zenoscave: But you don't know which potion will be next. having ample t3's but not too many is important
 GenesisWasTaken: yeah stacking 10 gold ingredients is a very common problem
 GenesisWasTaken: I've seen it way too many times
 elderlybeginner: i believe I'm learning and casting improperly
 GenesisWasTaken: also, multicast
 GenesisWasTaken: I can't believe I forgot about that up until upper silver
 elderlybeginner: improperly casting when no solution is founded
 GenesisWasTaken: I was doing single cast all the way from bronze to like, top 400 silver
 GenesisWasTaken: before I started generating states for multicasts
 elderlybeginner: i have multicasting included in simulation only
 GenesisWasTaken: also, how many states are you able to generate in 50ms?
 GenesisWasTaken: it's ironic how my old bot was super efficient about generating states (only 1-2k before timing out)
 Zenoscave: 30-40k
 elderlybeginner: i don't see big difference between 2k and 5k; thus it's about heuristics
 GenesisWasTaken: so I tried a solution that doesn't require as much simulation
 GenesisWasTaken: but then my current bot does 5k sims in 5ms
 GenesisWasTaken: I'm like
 GenesisWasTaken: NOW you decide to be fast huh
 GenesisWasTaken: when I don't need you to be
 NinjaDoggy: @Zenoscave
 NinjaDoggy: my secret sauce pruning is finally being useful! :O
 NinjaDoggy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b35c2180-042a-45e0-9c94-24c6d3bb53c1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b35c2180-042a-45e0-9c94-24c6d3bb53c1</a>
 NinjaDoggy: I'm computing the best possible set of 6 brews given an initial set of casts, and a fixed 11 brews
 Zenoscave: Nice NinjaDoggy!
 NinjaDoggy: it's easily searching depth 40-60 &lt; 1 second XD
 Zenoscave: I'm trying to do opp blocking
 NinjaDoggy: ah...
 NinjaDoggy: it's a pain
 Zenoscave: any pointers?
 NinjaDoggy: simulate your opponent for a given depth
 NinjaDoggy: then simulate your self for that same depth
 GenesisWasTaken: oh yeah speaking of which, I should do that also
 NinjaDoggy: compute opp turn 1, then ur turn 1, then opp turn 2, etc
 Zenoscave: then rinse and repeat?
 NinjaDoggy: knowing minDist to potions really helps
 NinjaDoggy: yea
 GenesisWasTaken: right now what I'm doing is
 GenesisWasTaken: check which potion has the highest return for my opponent
 GenesisWasTaken: like, point/turn for him
 GenesisWasTaken: then if I can get to it in less turns than he can
 GenesisWasTaken: I'll rush it
 GenesisWasTaken: but only if he doesn't have a second best option available in 2-3 turns
 Zenoscave: But what if he has two other potions where p1+p2 / (t1+t2) is &gt;?
 NinjaDoggy: sry p1+p2/t1+t2 is?
 Zenoscave: points and turns for items 1 and 2
 GenesisWasTaken: my thought is, if I go out of my way and do unoptimal things to block him, only to have him brew another potion 1 turn later
 GenesisWasTaken: that wouldn't be very profitable
 GenesisWasTaken: so I only do that if my opponent doesn't have a second option available within x turns
 NinjaDoggy: wait sry i'm prob being dense rn but
 NinjaDoggy: what's points and turns?
 Zenoscave: minDist and Price
 NinjaDoggy: oh like if there's multiple options for opponent
 Zenoscave: Yeah
 NinjaDoggy: like if you block potion 1, but they do potion 2
 NinjaDoggy: hehe ok secret sauce time
 GenesisWasTaken: yeah that
 Zenoscave: I chose the wrong one a lot
 GenesisWasTaken: but yeah, as I said, I only do opponent blocking if they don't have another option within 2-3 turns
 GenesisWasTaken: probably not the best way to do it
 GenesisWasTaken: but it kinda improved my bot compared to not doing it at all
 GenesisWasTaken: another thing I picked up from my colleague is to use a bit field to store spell castable state instead of storing a boolean on each Spell instance
 GenesisWasTaken: so when you generate a new state, you only need to generate 1 bit field, instead of n booleans
 GenesisWasTaken: with n being the number of spells
 GenesisWasTaken: which in turn, means I don't even have to clone the spells, but rather just use the original array
 GenesisWasTaken: anyway I'm gonna go grab something for lunch while waiting for my bot to reach silver
 GenesisWasTaken: see you guys later
 elderlybeginner: any one with python's code contest here? How long is your code?
 ClockSort: alright, we're submitting. Let's roll.
 NinjaDoggy: let's see it CLOCKSORT
 NinjaDoggy: (don't mind if you bump me to legend&#160;;) )
 miszu: rush B my friend
 ClockSort: so far, meh results
 miszu: yeah saw it&#160;:/
 ClockSort: 16% done, server isn't that bad
 NoobCod3: guys join the class of code im lonely
 miszu: question for c++, does a function that returns a primitive can be returned as const?
 Csipcsirip: it's not tha hard to try out :p
 miszu: sorry I meant can it always be returned as const?
 Csipcsirip: I don't understand the question
 miszu: const before a function definition means the return value won't be modified
 Good_Coder: Lol
 Good_Coder: Hi
 Good_Coder: Hi
 Csipcsirip: const int f() {return 1;}&#160;?
 Good_Coder:&#160;???
 Good_Coder:&#160;???
 Good_Coder: ...
 miszu: int is a primitif
 miszu: primitive*
 Good_Coder:&#160;??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
 Good_Coder:&#160;?????????????????????????????????????????????????
 Csipcsirip: in this case if you do this: int a = f(); a will be modifiable
 miszu: so could you say that whenever you return a primitive you could always put a const before?
 Good_Coder:&#160;????????????????????????????????????????????
 Zenoscave: Good_Coder quit.
 Csipcsirip: but you can do int f(){return 1;} const int a = f(); in this case a is const
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Coding with 1 day left in challenge...everyone: FML  ME:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So6uDI0M-40&amp;&amp;tt=666">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So6uDI0M-40&amp;&amp;tt=666</a>
 miszu: yeah I know you can but
 ClockSort: top 100 Gold and climbing, yess!
 miszu: primitives will always be const when returned though
 miszu: even if you don't put const
 Csipcsirip: wut? no.
 Zenoscave: nice ClockSort
 Csipcsirip: int a = f(); a = 69; 
 miszu: yeah
 NinjaDoggy: i think he means
 NinjaDoggy: f() = 69
 NinjaDoggy: doesn't work?
 ClockSort: try f() = 420
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 NinjaDoggy: maybe compiler will allow it
 miszu: can't lol
 miszu: haha
 miszu: because f() is not an l-value
 Csipcsirip: oh okay. never tried that :D
 miszu: if you are interested into why you can't do: 5 = 7, it has to do with l-value in a language
 ClockSort: also 5 isn't 7
 miszu: pretty interesting
 miszu: I really mean 5 = 7 and not 5 == 7
 The_Duck: 5 isn't 7 until you set it equal to 7, maybe&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Prove it ClockSort

 Instafluff: anyone happen to know how to avoid a big gc spike for JS on CG?
 ClockSort: never lose a reference to any object. then GC doesn't have anything to clean up
 dbdr: it will still try...
 Instafluff: hmm...
 ClockSort: it worked for me in C#, haven't tried JS

 reCurse: It makes GC traversal slower for one
 reCurse: Not sure it's a benefit but if it works for you
 wlesavo: assertion triggered, do not know why though eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: assert(wlesavo &gt; eulerscheZahl)
 reCurse: Hmm is it bad to have coffee at 2am
 dbdr: assert(can_still_win())
 Ifthel: Instafluff my bet, reuse via a set() command instead of instantiating, keep a bunch of that object type in an array for later reuse.
 wlesavo: smth like that
 eulerscheZahl: get some sleep and come back stronger tomorrow reCurse
 reCurse: But tomorrow will be wasted with servers
 reCurse: If I stay up longer now I can stay up longer tomorrow
 reCurse: Or something...
 eulerscheZahl: did you take off from work?
 reCurse: Monday? Yeah
 wlesavo: submits will be dead soon anyways
 eulerscheZahl: smart move. i did the same :D

 reCurse: So wanna make it count
 eulerscheZahl: oh, relevant changes in your life?
 reCurse: Possibly
 eulerscheZahl: still lurking on the chat?
 reCurse: Discord yeah
 reCurse: Webchat unlikely
 dbdr: good content on discord?
 reCurse: I prefer the chat on discord and I'm already pretty active on it
 reCurse: Webchat means another app/window meh
 benlinn: fk man this game is hard
 dbdr: not for reCurse&#160;;)
 reCurse: I beg to differ
 benlinn: who's that lol
 reCurse: I'm starting to hate this game with every fiber of my soul
 benlinn: lol
 benlinn: nice to meet u guys&#160;:) i just want to get to bronze before time runs out
 dbdr: inb4 ragequit
 benlinn: dont give me any hints hto
 kovi: which was the last game you liked recurse?
 dbdr: ragequit and still win&#160;:)
 reCurse: tbh I think it's more the contest effect
 kovi: (i remember such last day hate for quite a few times...)
 kovi: yeah...we got tired
 reCurse: Like I'm sick of watching or thinking about it
 reCurse: lol
 kovi: at least its not 4 week long as locm
 dbdr: burnout
 wlesavo: felt this way about phd thesesis
 wlesavo: still do
 kovi: 4 week without depth. halite3 was good
 reCurse: Last game I liked is probably FB or WW I think
 reCurse: On CG
 Csipcsirip: server is so dead already. rip spamsubmit
 wlesavo: and it is only 100 ppl computing
 Gonny: when it's that slow to push because servers are overloaded, does it potentially increase your time outs?
 wlesavo: would be close to 400 later
 blasterpoard: I suppose it's so slow because of everyone running cgbenchmark
 blasterpoard: (not me, my bot is not finished yet, I have nothing to test)
 Csipcsirip: and games are even much shorter than usual
 Csipcsirip: usually there are 100+ turns at least
 wlesavo: yeah imagine 300 turn games
 blasterpoard: I wonder why there were absolutely no problems during kutulu, 4players and 200 turns...
 blasterpoard: maybe it depends more on the load of their cloud provider, not CG itself
 kovi: maybe cause heuristic was enough to reach top gold in kutu
 eulerscheZahl: or CG still has some problems with the backend
 Batpapa: Do you know if in C++ there is any way to set the flag fpermissive? Virtual pure inheritance couldn't work without it..
 Westicles: maybe 
 Westicles: #pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-fpermissive"
 Batpapa: I already tried, but without success&#160;:'(
 Batpapa: I think i'll just recode some classes then
 Westicles: you could do it the hard way from bash
 Batpapa: Isn't it considered cheating? Because you by-pass their compiler limitation
 CommanderCero: nah everyone uses pragmas otherwise c++ would be slow as hell
 Batpapa: sure, at least for O3
 Westicles: did you try this
 Westicles: #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wunused-result"
 Westicles: you can list exceptions error by error
 kovi: wow, new leader. very nice submit bourgeof
 bourgeof: thank you kovi, but the submit is not finished yet...
 bourgeof: But it is a very good start&#160;:)
 kovi: well, impressive start
 bourgeof: Best ever for me&#160;:)
 Batpapa: I always get
 Batpapa: note: (if you use ‘-fpermissive’, G++ will accept your code, but allowing the use of an undeclared name is deprecated)
 wlesavo: solid lead, nice
 Batpapa: no worries, I give up!
 LLG: I changed a tiny bit of how I choose spells to learn
 LLG: I hope that's enough to push me to gold
 LLG: I was #15 silver at 50% battles before the submit so maybe I could've been gold anyway, but let's see
 Csipcsirip: wow bourgeof, calm down
 bourgeof:&#160;;)
 Csipcsirip: writing minimax to the endgame is giving me headaches&#160;:(
 benlinn: battles in progress 0%
 Instafluff: -1% :joy:
 GenesisWasTaken: accidentally resubmitted both my smurf and my main
 GenesisWasTaken: inb4 fighting myself
 eulerscheZahl: you aren't allowed to use smurfs in contests
 GenesisWasTaken: 👀 welp time to abandon my smurf
 eulerscheZahl: last time thibaud was thinking about removing only the smurfs or both smurf and main account
 eulerscheZahl: CG has some plagiarism check
 eulerscheZahl: afaik they only run it for gold+legend
 GenesisWasTaken: can I somehow delete my smurf so my main stay safe? 👀
 GenesisWasTaken: there's a chance both my accounts get to gold on this submit
 eulerscheZahl: then resubmit before it finishes
 eulerscheZahl: a worse bot of course
 Batpapa: have you any known way to by-pass the 100ko file size limitation?
 eulerscheZahl: no. the limit is chars, not bytes
 eulerscheZahl: so fancy unicode can increase it a bit
 Batpapa: arhhh
 Batpapa: I guess I have to make different files for differents techniques
 GenesisWasTaken: what are you guys doing with your files that make it exceed 100 tho 👀
 The_Duck: you can strip whitespace and comments to save some characters
 eulerscheZahl: or use tab instead of space if you code in python
 Batpapa: plenty of classes
 Instafluff: minify :joy:
 Batpapa: oh yeah, it's 4 spaces instead of each tab, good guess!
 GenesisWasTaken: hi instafluff! was just watching the vod of your stream
 eulerscheZahl: be careful about compression. if it's considered as obfuscation, it can disqualify you
 GenesisWasTaken: you planning on streaming anytime soon?
 Instafluff: hi genesis!
 Instafluff: not anymore til next week :worried:
 Instafluff: thanks for watching it btw!
 Instafluff: i didn't know that. thanks for the heads up euler!
 GenesisWasTaken: you shooting for gold today Instafluff?
 Instafluff: hopefully. i was struggling vs random GC timeouts tonight and trying potential workarounds
 Instafluff: it's looking like all of today will be struggling against the servers :joy:
 GenesisWasTaken: lol xD good luck with that
 GenesisWasTaken: I'm procrastinating redoing some parts of my heuristics
 KingKirb64: Yo, how are  we doing 3am gang?
 GenesisWasTaken: all I've done today is change my spells limit from 12 to 13 and fix 1 faulty comparison (where it compared references instead of values)
 GenesisWasTaken: and somehow I'm seeing good improvements xD
 Instafluff: thanks! good luck to you too. hopefully i can get back to working on the heur soon too :D

 benlinn: does anybody in the higher levels use javascript?
 Instafluff: im using JS in silver atm :thinking:
 LLG: there are a bunch of people in gold who uses js
 benlinn: sweet ^
 LLG: and 1 guy in legend who uses python
 LLG: what a legend
 benlinn: lol wow
 benlinn: im guessing the best use C++ though?
 LLG: yeah I think most ppl in legend uses c++ and rust
 Instafluff: generally ya, if you need the iterations for simulation
 benlinn: oh i just realized i can look it up myself
 LLG: yeah that's where I get my information from xD
 benlinn: 90% C++, 10% java and rust

 PatrickMcGinnisII: no Tatiana Shmaylyuk?
 Westicles: I don't even know who they are... they made us memorize that in high school French and it never went away
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Lo siento
 linjoehan: lol PatrickMcGinnisII now you just name dropping.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gheesh, I'm running two trees per turn.  One with learns and rests and a quick one with just casts.  can't get depth
 lowzhao: how to prevent timeout?
 linjoehan: do it faster.
 lowzhao: njoe
 lowzhao: lol cool
 lowzhao: i will do it faster then
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I was trying to do 2 consecutive brew pairings eval instead of the single brew logic... but just can't quite get there
 lowzhao: what if you just change the problem to be a double for loop?
 lowzhao: and same BFS logic
 lowzhao: use an array to prevent revisiting
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm depth first, i can reach 20k nodes, but everytime i try to use trim logic to get deeper i timeout
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sob
 lowzhao: depth first and stop and second brew?
 lowzhao: at*
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can see all the available brews first occurrences, but can't reach all of the 2nd brews...some but not all
 lowzhao: I think you should consider ignore some paths if its over a certain best that you already have found
 kotamanegi: I agree with lowzhao, it's useless to think something like resting 10x times, just use calculation time wisely to find some better answer.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm not usiing eval functions like yall prolly are,  after i saw top bots winning games in 30 turns, I started looking at combinatorial brew pair paths
 blasterpoard: PatrickMcGinnisII 30? that's a lot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/508221358">https://www.codingame.com/replay/508221358</a>

 kotamanegi: :sweat_smile:
 kotamanegi: 1 hour ago solution is still 26% progress :disappointed_relieved:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: running new tree without learns after turn 10 or so, does the trick ... but I have to run local to find optimal learn pathways to desired destination pairings...eww, damn php making me shortcut
 kovi: i wonder if i submit now, will that finish at the end?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i don't remember, does CG recalc, or just let everything running finish?
 dbdr: recalc legend
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my last submit was 3 days ago
 kovi: after finish i think

 blasterpoard: but it wins against your style of play
 wlesavo: yeah, i have like 0% winrate against it
 blasterpoard:&#160;:)
 blasterpoard: (I'm very greedy and lose vs players who learn 6 or less spells)
 kovi: cgbench should be limited to current top5....
 eulerscheZahl: you mean only those should be allowed to use it?
 eulerscheZahl: or only play vs them in your batch?
 kovi: yeah. maybe top5-vs-top5 games only
 AntiSquid: lol
 LordSkaven: my hashcode code is broken so using a hashset makes my bot dumb, but using a list means I have to stop searching really early. ARRRGH
 wlesavo: tough battle at the top, recalc would be fun to watch

 PatrickMcGinnisII: holy crap...total nodes = 208735
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, first turn only
 LLG: dang
 LLG: rank 16 silver
 LLG: so close
 LLG: had a series of close defeats around rank 100... if I won 2-3 more I could've been gold
 LLG: my winrate in 10-30 is good
 Cappefra: mmm when's the end exactly?
 aCat: you have timer om the top of IDE
 PatrickMcGinnisII: says up top in the ide
 aCat: 22h 26m
 WINWINWIN: Well done PB4
 JFB: Only 50 participants left to 7000&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: we can do it
 JFB: Everyone in Legend will add 1 smerf&#160;:-)
 Westicles: How many in legend are people never heard of before?
 Westicles: I guess delineate and most of the japanese
 WINWINWIN: actually its only 4
 MenoIy: what  is the best way to know  wich  potion i should brew xD I suck at math...
 Westicles: This is a programming site, not a math site.  So I've been emphatically told
 MenoIy:&#160;:(
 kotamanegi: I heard tha score for potions is determined by tier-0 * 1 + tier-1 * 2 + tier-2 * 3 + tier-3 * 4
 kotamanegi: Of course there's noise x for (-2 &lt;= x &lt;= 2)
 lainislain: thats actully the price
 MenoIy: ah ok thx &lt;3
 Cappefra: are there good resources for beam search? There's an article here in codingame where the GitHub link gives back a 404
 wlesavo: if you have general understanding you would be fine
 kotamanegi: If you want to know spells &amp; recipe list, please look at github for info. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java</a>
 kotamanegi: @Menoly
 MenoIy: thx 
 JFB: Am I correct that when you said beam search - you mean Breadth-first search with pruning&#160;?
 LLG: I believe so. From what I understand, beam search is a BFS that only explores n most promising nodes at every depth.
 aCat: yes
 Q12: How do you determine which node is worth exploring?
 LLG: that's where heuristics come into play
 LLG: inventory state, distance towards potions, etc.
 eulerscheZahl: kotamanegi the "noise" is +1 for 3 colors and +2 for 4 colors
 Q12: Thanks, maybe I will use it
 Whiskee: is there anything more reliable than Stopwatch for C#? Because this is honestly getting infuriating, ticks vary too much&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: Stopwatch is good enough
 Presac: Is the distance towards potions just the ingredients missing?
 eulerscheZahl: use ElapsedMilliseconds
 ParticleBeam: Try only starting the stopwatch after the first input read
 eulerscheZahl: and start the timer after reading the first line of input
 LLG: ingredients missing, but with different weight on different tiers
 Whiskee: it's what I'm using, it easily leaps forward 5ms
 LLG: missing 1 blue is closer than missing 1 yellow
 Whiskee: same exact loop
 eulerscheZahl: CG has some problems in general
 eulerscheZahl: most players use a time limit around 40ms
 LLG: right now I'm only exploring inventory states
 ParticleBeam: Also, garbage collector might run in the background
 LLG: so I don't even exceed 10ms most turns
 Whiskee: I guess it really is the garbage collector complicating things, because I'm repeating the same identical state several times in a row, same calculations, averaging 38-39 and then getting spikes of 55
 Icebox: damn
 Icebox: I wasted 16h
 LLG: I tried playing against my own bot
 LLG: and 1 of them took 10ms a turn, the other one took 11ms for the exact turn
 eulerscheZahl: with what Icebox?
 eulerscheZahl: debugging?
 Icebox: no, with sleeping
 wlesavo: lul
 Icebox: :D
 eulerscheZahl: sleep is never wasted
 kotamanegi: @eulerscheZahi thx for info. I haven't noticed that :D
 LLG: it is possible to get to a higher rank by just resubmitting without changing your code right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but you can also drop
 LLG: yeah that's why I'm afraid to do it
 Icebox: volatiliy giveth, volatility taketh away
 eulerscheZahl: improving your code is more reliable if you want to gain ranks
 wlesavo: 50 ppl 5 gameson the start of submit, nice
 LLG: I'm very close to gold
 LLG: like, top 10 kind of close
 LLG: so I was thinking maybe resubmitting could move me up just a little bit
 eulerscheZahl: it's only to gold, still lots of room for improemvents
 wlesavo: or not, dam, itis still 3 isnt it
 LLG: yeah I guess I could actually write a proper BFS for starter
 LLG: right now I prune all states with the same inventory state, except when I just rested
 LLG: I guess I could start taking spell states into account lol
 LLG: been putting that off way too long
 Whiskee: I'm changing so many things at once that I don't know how to title my commits
 Whiskee: best development practices out of the window
 geppoz: :D same here Whiskee
 Cappefra: honestly if you don't end up with some sort of spaghetti code mad props to you
 geppoz: I will create a git next contest
 WINWINWIN: Geppoz, dropbox is better.
 geppoz: dropbox?? I mean for trace all changes, all back-and-forth ideas
 geppoz: not for sharing&#160;;)
 Icebox: magine Version control with dropbox
 Icebox: kappa
 geppoz: oh, I didn't know
 JohnCM: haha once i extended my depth to 10, my code performed worse than it was at 5
 Icebox: yes, I'm being sarcastic 
 JohnCM: 'cause i considered multiple brews (which may not have existed by the time)
 Icebox: dropbox isn't for code :D
 JohnCM: icebox, how're you?
 Icebox: I'm doing fine, thanks, how about you?
 JohnCM: i've been trying the past two days to get into gold, but now still stuck at top 50 silver
 JohnCM: i even recoded my entire python code into c++
 JohnCM: which gained me 5+ depths
 Cappefra: Pretty sure this is the hardest challeng to get into gold
 JohnCM: that's how inefficient python is
 Cappefra: it doesn't feel that way but it's so hard
 JohnCM: it's hard because it's too easy
 JohnCM: there's too few things you can do
 Icebox: well there are people in legend with python JohnCM
 JohnCM: haha i wonder what they did
 geppoz: same here
 JohnCM: there must be something i'm missing out
 geppoz: in python I had 30ms for GC
 JohnCM: wait for post-mortem to be enlightened
 geppoz: it is possible to do static allocation in python??
 JohnCM: memset equivalent in python?
 Cappefra: It might be because of how many people there are and your bot needs to be performing well against more different strategies at the same time
 geppoz: (Im newbye in python btw, but i got silver with it, before switch to c++)
 Icebox: geppoz you just need to know what operators reallocate memory in python
 Icebox: and then avoid those
 ParticleBeam: Create a super long list in the beginning as reuse list with an index?
 geppoz: that: newboards=[]
 JohnCM: size = ...buffer = bytearray(size)
 JohnCM: bytearray is implememted in C
 JohnCM: i think maybe that's why my code is so slow. i used lists, which is super slow
 JohnCM: geppoz i think you'll be silver soon
 JohnCM: i mean gold
 JohnCM: wish i could be bumped up to gold overnight
 JohnCM: i can win the silver boss 70% of the time already
 geppoz: seems so...
 JohnCM: 49th in silver now... come on
 JohnCM: few more bumps will do it
 geppoz: I just noticed that i was calling clock() at every explored node :D
 geppoz: that was big my timeout fear :D
 JohnCM: my performance actually became better after i removed pruning
 JohnCM: i think i removed a few important branches
 geppoz: now i call it every 16th explore and i gained one depth!
 JohnCM: geppoz how many spells on average do you learn?
 JohnCM: wondering if there is a sweet spot
 geppoz: i hardcoded the first 6
 JohnCM: i hardcorded the first 8 haha
 geppoz: then it is free to learn if it finds a good reason to
 JohnCM: yea.. maybe 6, then let the program decide if learning reduces number of turns
 JohnCM: haha i have some ideas in mind, but very lazy to code out
 JohnCM: spent the whole day yesterday coding the c++ version alr
 geppoz: someone top hardcoded 8
 JohnCM: my first time coding c++, took a while
 JohnCM: lucky got some kind souls told me how to do struct and vector initialization here
 JohnCM: so it was easier
 geppoz: yeah, Im gold&#160;;)
 JohnCM: yay congrats
 geppoz: ty
 JohnCM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/508832954">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/508832954</a>
 JohnCM: oh my algo can win yours
 JohnCM: maybe i should just wait out
 JohnCM: oh wait, that's a timeout
 JohnCM: yours is better
 geppoz:&#160;:( my timeout again
 geppoz: and I was winning :D
 JohnCM: very impressive code there geppoz
 JohnCM: you beat me by 30 pts
 geppoz: maybe you learn too much at start, so the tree is too wide&#160;?
 JohnCM: do you learn only the bottom tree, or the 2nd line also can
 JohnCM: i was trying to limit my number of actions per turn
 JohnCM: i have a feeling your code can reach legend geppoz
 geppoz: I dont think so
 JohnCM: you are doing 90+ in 40 turns
 JohnCM: that's very high score
 geppoz: I dont play opponent, and contest is almost over
 JohnCM: that timeout though...
 JohnCM: you might want to reduce a depth
 geppoz: I need to add opponent, I dont think I can do it today
 JohnCM: next competition then
 JohnCM: just a little disappointed i can't make gold
 LLG: #1 silver now
 LLG: it would be great if someone were to push me up&#160;:^)
 JohnCM: soon your turn
 geppoz: you can get gold johncm
 LLG: just take the day off tomorrow and grind your ass of&#160;:^)
 LLG: you're very close
 JohnCM: haha i hope so, now i'll code in dynamic spell learning
 JohnCM: hope it pushes me closer
 JohnCM: then maybe enemy prediction later
 geppoz: enemy prediction is a big change, and it is not needed for gold, so if you just want to reach gold, i suggest not to sail for it if you cannot spend all day and night on it :D
 JohnCM: ha yea
 JohnCM: dynamic spell learning then
 JohnCM: not much time left anyway
 rockstar555: hii guys i am felling so tried 
 rockstar555: because i woke up all night to solve a hard puzzle
 rockstar555: :tired_face:
 JohnCM: did you solve it?
 JohnCM: some hard puzzles i solve only 90%, the last 10% is too hard
 Cappefra: same
 Cappefra: I really enjoyed skynet episode 2
 geppoz: I'm working on the "Nintendo sponsored" puzzle by years :D
 geppoz: literally
 WINWINWIN: Up all night for only 1 puzzle?
 WINWINWIN: You solved like 5 last night
 LLG: I'm .03 below the boss
 LLG: this is intense lol
 MadKnight: u got 21h to get RNG'ed into next league
 LLG: I'll improve my bot after dinner
 rockstar555: i solve it only 90%
 LLG: even if I get to next league I still want high placement, cause my colleague is tailing me very close
 LLG: and we're competing
 MadKnight: oh
 MadKnight: are u doing beam search&#160;?
 LLG: not really, I'm doing exhaustive bfs
 LLG: but I don't take into account spell states, only inventory states
 LLG: so there's only like, 2000ish states to explore
 rockstar555: I have fever also
 LLG: I'm doing exhaustive for me and my opponent every turn
 rockstar555: last night
 LLG: Siska is looking scary tho
 LLG: already at #3 at just 63%
 Zanoshky: guys, i use java for contest, but i lose 66ms just to read input&#160;?? what is this?
 Zanoshky: in.nextInt() for all states takes between 43 to 62 ms?
 therealbeef: that probably includes waiting time for something to appear on stdin
 WINWINWIN: Are you measuring time right around the input statement?
 LLG: generally you want to start measuring after reading the first line
 Zanoshky: i use system nanotime on start of the while loop, and at the end of last nextint()
 LLG: start your timer after reading the first line
 Zanoshky: sure one sec
 WINWINWIN: Ok, are there any methods in that area? It could be that.
 LLG: I had that problem with c# and typescript
 therealbeef: they should have made this clearer in the game rules, i think
 LLG: there's a couple milliseconds of nothingness between the start of the while loop and when you read the first input
 LLG: not sure why, but I'm pretty certain there is
 Zanoshky: thanks! works much better
 Beresta: easy example would be if you end turn in 1ms and your enemy ends in 50ms - you will have a delay till next input of 49ms + whatever takes engine to evaluate both moves
 Beresta: so yea, starting measuring after first input line is a good idea
 PatrickMcGinnisII: still wierd stuff in output from referee
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Standard Output Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ede3e03d-009e-498b-9f39-b4e12bf799f0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ede3e03d-009e-498b-9f39-b4e12bf799f0</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: same inventory
 PatrickMcGinnisII: played against myself
 Beresta: is it really same? looks like lhs has 1 more inv space free
 LLG: do you have replay link?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nothing was lost, inventory not full
 LLG: rip I lost a game to Orpheo
 LLG: there goes my plan of getting RNG'd to gold
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it computed inventory correctly
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess player 1 had 1 more 0 ingredient
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm
 Orpheo: @LLG same I'm betting on RNG, sorry&#160;:(
 LLG: 😔
 LLG: also the real question is, Patrick
 LLG: how the hell did you get to 5 taxed blues
 PatrickMcGinnisII: both players learned 5 turns in a row
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er, hmmm,, should be even #
 LLG: and yet none of them touched the bottom spell 👀
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, learned 1 spell above
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup 5 learns per
 PatrickMcGinnisII: testing differrent learn priorities
 LLG: also, idk if I'm being dumb here
 LLG: but isn't this kind of thing very easy to test by just looking at the game screen
 LLG: you can just look at it and see if the output matches with what's happening
 Beresta: I have a bunch of safety checks end of turn and throw exception if my turn is somehow invalid from expectations :D helped me to found a dozen bugs in my bot
 LLG: YES!!!
 LLG: RNG'd to gold
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/508856776">https://www.codingame.com/replay/508856776</a>
 Beresta: gratz
 Orpheo: gg
 LLG: Good luck Orpheo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the game summary output is just wonky
 LLG: hopefully I'll see you here soon
 Orpheo: ty ^^

 MadKnight: there's actually 1001, LLG
 LLG: 1001 for 1 player
 MadKnight: oh, u want it for 2 players&#160;?
 MadKnight: but isn't it 1001*1001&#160;?
 LLG: I'm doing it for 2 players
 LLG: separately, not in the same bfs
 MadKnight: ooh
 LLG: I run bfs once for me, once for my opponent
 MadKnight: but why&#160;?
 LLG: then extract the data that I need, like shortest path to each potions etc.
 eulerscheZahl: to know when the game will end
 MadKnight: and how do u use the results of your BFS&#160;?
 MadKnight: of enemy bfs i mean
 eulerscheZahl: score some more points before opponent completes 6th potion
 LLG: the result of my bfs is shortest path to each potion
 eulerscheZahl: or end game early yourself
 LLG: so, let's say, my opponent has a shorter path towards the best potion
 LLG: I'll go for the next best
 LLG: that kind of stuff
 LLG: and yeah end game optimization also
 LLG: if he's at 5 and I can't beat him to 6, I'll just stack ingredients for the endgame bonus
 MadKnight: but what if he isn't going for that potion&#160;?
 LLG: well, I'm playing for worst case scenario
 LLG: I think my idea is to maximize my worst outcome
 MadKnight: worst case is if he's going for multiple possible
 LLG: I mean worst case when it comes to the 6th potion race
 LLG: worst case is if he picks his closest potion, and it's a shorter path than whatever i'm going for
 geppoz: MadKnight what's 1001&#160;?
 Orpheo: I made it also to Gold :D same code i've been resubmitting since yesterday with minor modifications ^^
 MuddySneakers: Ha! Link404 timed out!?!
 kotamanegi: Everyone get timed out. Even Silver Boss does.
 MuddySneakers: That's the gold boss that timed out.
 kotamanegi: Ya, my Link404 too lol
 kotamanegi: I bet program execution time is longer than expected because of it's busy server
 rockstar555: hii
 LLG: geppoz 1001 possible inventory states
 LLG: and congrats Orpheo
 rockstar555: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/1f5b0ff230728fcbcecbae143f3ae5148463604/achievements">https://www.codingame.com/profile/1f5b0ff230728fcbcecbae143f3ae5148463604/achievements</a>
 MadKnight: faster than what&#160;?
 Zanoshky: Arrays.sort(enemyBfsAction, Comparator.comparing(Result::getKey));
 Zanoshky: this take 10MS!
 Zanoshky: wtf?
 Beresta: what, can't be true
 LLG: sounds fishy
 MadKnight: show us more code
 Zanoshky:  System.err.println("Sort start + " + printRoundTime() + " ms");
 Zanoshky: this is 10 ms
 MadKnight: wat
 MadKnight: cmon
 MadKnight: obvious
 Zanoshky: i am stunned
 MadKnight: your timer also counts the printing time
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you solved the nintendo puzzle rockstar555. i still struggle with this one. can you give me a clue what algos to look up?
 Icebox: eulerscheZahl he already solved that yesterday
 Icebox: you're so late
 eulerscheZahl: my bad
 MadKnight: try not counting the printing time Zanoshky
 DerthekNagra: I am having trouble keeping the number of brews that the opponent has done in the fall challenge. Any suggestions?
 Beresta: check current and prev turn enemy score, if it changed =&gt; he brewed
 rockstar555: Sorry guys I am Playing Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe
 DerthekNagra: Oh! Thanks! How didnt I think of that :D
 kotamanegi: Same can be said for Bonus BREW points (just a reminder)
 struct: Icebox today no sleep?
 Icebox: nope
 wlesavo: around the time somebody should ban this cheater guy, atleast from chat
 Icebox: till the end
 struct: ok, maybe ill do the same

 eulerscheZahl: to be fair: lots of green+blue

 HCCHEN: where are the puzzles?
 HCCHEN: 1 more puzzle to level up but I can't find the puzzles
 wlesavo: euler also default feeded you with some blues
 VizGhar: @HCCHEN top menu -&gt; practice&#160;?
 ParticleBeam: I'm missing something fundamental
 HCCHEN: ha, thank you very much
 rockstar555: hey guys what you do today
 wlesavo: can someone finally ban this guy? he is really annoying
 WINWINWIN: rockstar??
 WINWINWIN: I`m not even sure if he's a guy or someone's chatbot...
 struct: But he is a genius, he solved nintendo
 struct: And managed to solve some puzzles exactly with the same code as another player
 WINWINWIN: :P
 WINWINWIN: But I'm sure of the chatbot theory...
 struct: I think he is a troll yeah
 Westicles: He's just a kid
 Icebox: I'm already writing up a message to thibaud about the whole impresonation thing besides copying
 Icebox: for a chat ban he hasn't done anything wrong tbh
 struct: yeah
 WINWINWIN: I don't think that anyone would mistake him for Euler :P so not really impersonation...
 Icebox: still
 geppoz: congratz struct for gold&#160;;) I just followed you&#160;;)
 Icebox: imagine someone picks your uni, your location and your job WINWINWIN
 struct: that geppoz
 Icebox: wouldn't you be creeped out even if just a little?
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo 01:48PMcan someone finally ban this guy? he is really annoying
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, its pretty weird...
 Astrobytes: He's still hanging around then
 Icebox: imagine the weird eye contact once you meet him in your job eulerscheZahl
 Icebox: would be awkward as hell&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 WINWINWIN: :joy:
 Astrobytes: lol
 Westicles: Like a sitcom... euler, meet your new boss
 Astrobytes: Hey, Westicles. did you change your pi digits puzzle? I swear your first solution was even more amusing
 Astrobytes: *contribution
 eulerscheZahl: it got too many downvotes
 eulerscheZahl: so he changed it to add even more digits
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Icebox: ah, classic
 Westicles: The first one was awesome, but everybody hated the unicode.  Now everybody hate it because too much math
 PatrickMcGinnisII: too many hairs in your pie?
 Astrobytes: 3rd time lucky: use both 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er pi?
 eulerscheZahl: just create a clash of code where you have to add up ASCII values. higher chance to get it approved
 Astrobytes: lol, sadly true
 Westicles: And thanks to icebox BTW for the algorithm.  I never would have dreamed a million digits in a half second is possible
 Icebox: &lt;3
 aCat: what's the cod elimit length??
 Presac: I wonder, how do you write and test your code? Personally, I write in vs code and copy it to codingame then run it there, but is there an easier way testing?
 Westicles: 100k characters.  some unicodes count as 1char, some 2
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Westicles using gmp.h is cheating, GMP in php is disabled in CG last time i checked
 Q12: Can someone help me? I am trying to use Stopwatch in C# to measure the time so I will be able to escape my recursive function before the time for the time end. But for some reason it doesn't work I checked with stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds how much time I have and it says 0 so I didn't escape the recursive function and then CG told me that I didn't provide input in time. what is the problem?
 ParticleBeam: Did you use stopwatch.Start()?
 Beresta: garbage collections is a usual suspect
 WINWINWIN: I don't know about the stopwatch, but there's another way for time
 Q12: yes ParticleBeam
 WINWINWIN: DateTime dt = DateTime.now;
 Westicles: I'm not implementing my own scientific programming package that will get rejected anyway just to avoid using gmp
 WINWINWIN: time = (dt - DateTime.now).TotalMilliseconds;
 WINWINWIN: now in capitals both times.
 Q12: thanks WINWINWIN, I will try this
 WINWINWIN: np
 AllYourMCTS: what about stopping like 2ms before you hit the time limit? it takes some time to return from all the recursive functions and output
 aCat: is it better / faster than stopwatch?
 Beresta: no
 eulerscheZahl: stopwatch is the way to go in C#
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, last submit...I'll be sleeping when challenge ends
 WINWINWIN: Euler is stopwatch faster?
 WINWINWIN: Because there is object creation in DateTime?
 Westicles: Do you think CG would put a couple wordlists in the sandbox for use in word puzzles if I asked?  Can think of any other way to get at them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm really surprised I've been hovering around 1000th place for 3 days
 Westicles: *can't
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think there's much of a difference. but when the standard library has a component specifically for that task, use it
 Beresta: there might be a difference on precision, as stopwatch uses high precision cpu timer, not sure about datetime tho
 Beresta: also datetime might have bigger overhead because it has a looooot of formatting, etc, capabilities
 Astrobytes: guess you'd have to ask them to find out tbh Westicles
 Westicles: Then I will secretly embed 2 million digits of pi
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you can give the wordlist via stdin in an SDK contribution
 eulerscheZahl: and just use some javascript to completely remove the viewer if you don't need it
 Westicles: well I was thinking a scrabble optim, so that would work
 AllYourMCTS: sanity check... you can't cast a spell that gives you an excess of ingredients right?
 ParticleBeam: i believe so
 eulerscheZahl: for scrabble you can have a viewer
 aCat: AllYourMCTS nope
 Westicles: yeah, it would need to look decent.  It would end up being offline though
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://azspcs.com/Contest/AlphabetCityLight">http://azspcs.com/Contest/AlphabetCityLight</a>
 Westicles: That's it exactly!
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you got 4th
 Astrobytes: nice!
 Westicles: Well, this one
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://azspcs.com/Contest/AlphabetCity/Standings">http://azspcs.com/Contest/AlphabetCity/Standings</a>
 Westicles: I did them manually and came in 3rd
 aCat: when you resubmit you always start from the bottom?
 eulerscheZahl: how long are you on CG now aCat?
 aCat: ew years
 Astrobytes: manually :D
 aCat: but at the beginning I didn;t do much
 aCat: I should knoiw this behaviour?
 Astrobytes: Probably :P
 eulerscheZahl: your submit always resets your score
 eulerscheZahl: so in legend you start at the 2nd-last place
 eulerscheZahl: right above the deleted emil.
 aCat: I was pretty sure some time ago the first matchmaking depends on you previous position
 eulerscheZahl: that's RAIC
 WINWINWIN: Do you ever have battles with the deleted Emil.?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Westicles: They all look like this.  Got to get double triples on three words

 eulerscheZahl: instant win as emil times out in turn 1
 Astrobytes: when is RAIC btw?
 eulerscheZahl: next week, got delayed
 Astrobytes: oh?
 eulerscheZahl: they had problems with their sandbox or whatever
 eulerscheZahl: as dbf mentioned yesterday
 WINWINWIN: But Emil as negative TrueSkill, so winning against him would have a negative impact on you?
 Astrobytes: I missed that
 Q12: Can somebody help me in private with the implantation of Stopwatch in c#? for some reason I can't make it

 eulerscheZahl: Console.WriteLine(action)
 Astrobytes: hmm, racing or fighting I wonder
 Q12: thanks, I am trying now
 eulerscheZahl: maybe both?
 Astrobytes: They didn't email this time? I can't find anything
 Astrobytes: true
 eulerscheZahl: and your geometry for collisions will be exactly defined, not just a block or sphere
 eulerscheZahl: (i don't know anything but at RAIC nothing surprises me anymore)
 Astrobytes: hahaha, you're not wrong there :D
 Valdemar: Astrobytes organizers said that it will be strategy game, with buildings and unit production
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't get an email either
 eulerscheZahl: just dfb on the chat and someone on their discord
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/610464993883848725/779803527584677898/2020-11-21_23.20.43.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/610464993883848725/779803527584677898/2020-11-21_23.20.43.png</a>
 Astrobytes: Oh I see Valdemar, thank you
 eulerscheZahl: we had that 2 or 3 years ago already?
 eulerscheZahl: with the hamburger tshirt
 Astrobytes: 'CodeCraft" - clue in the name I suppose
 eulerscheZahl: that's about the only thing i can read
 Valdemar: eulerscheZahl yes, but it was just battle without resource management
 AllYourMCTS: what is RAIC?
 WINWINWIN: Russian AI Cup
 JohnCM: thibaud rank 2 now in silvr
 JohnCM: haha
 LordSkaven: So annoying I lose most of my games by 1-3 points
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - so it is official web page for RAIC 2020? (I newer received tshirt (I win 2 times) so I play only for fun)
 JFB:&#160;;-)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gratz [CG]Thibaud
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just jumped
 Astrobytes: into gold I presume?
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII nods</b></p><p><img src="/a/45097182899192" /> struct: yes
 Astrobytes: cool, hey struct, well done&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: sorry to hear that JFB
 struct: thanks Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Legend today struct?
 struct: Doubt it
 eulerscheZahl: i'm only waiting for the last one from 2019. they gave a like where i had to enter shipping details just 1 or 2 months ago
 JFB: question: do Gold boss is random? Usually bosses have not been random (=not deterministic) but when I play with gold boss I have different result every time
 struct: Oh I just remember that if I want to get legend
 Astrobytes: think it's the timeout/timing issues JFB
 Valdemar: JFB it is undeterministic unfortunately
 struct: I need to  beat dbd
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - OK so maybe I have to wait&#160;:-)
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/508929069">https://www.codingame.com/replay/508929069</a>
 Astrobytes: timing instability so search cutting out at different times = different result
 struct: Got 1 but I think I need to be faster
 JohnCM: maybe monte carlo tree search?
 JFB: OK - thanks Astrobytes Valdemar
 JFB: So it is a bit a pity that Gold boss is not replaiyable. So probably I have to find sb deterministic near top of the Gold and optimize o win with him&#160;;-)
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII zzzzzzz</b></p><p><img src="/a/45990545847301" /> MuddySneakers: I'm not sure you're going to fine all that many folks who are deterministic near the top of Gold.
 JFB: True
 Adi28: hello!
 Adi28: anyone know how do add the ccompany logo&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i think only codingame staff can do so
 emh: number of matches in Silver increased from around 80 to 100? great! more time to climb to boss hehe&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: unlikely
 eulerscheZahl: just more players submitting at the same time
 struct: Anyone has any idea, why I get this error on brutal tester?
 struct: ERROR [com.magusgeek.brutaltester.GameThread] Problem with referee output in game1. Output content:WARNING: sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass is not supported. This will impact performance.
 eulerscheZahl: so you get these extra matches duing your submit
 emh: ohhh
 emh: in that way
 geppoz: eulerscheZahl about inserting logos in company and school, there is someone to ask for?
 eulerscheZahl: thiabud
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud
 Mohammadmh: hi
 JohnCM: lol it's so hard to get into gold
 emh: JohnCM true true
 [CG]Thibaud: thx PatrickMcGinnisII
 emh: I've been struggling for days
 [CG]Thibaud: was difficult!
 JohnCM: i'm hovering 50-100, still have 60% more games
 JohnCM: and i beat the boss now 80% of the time
 JohnCM: my AI is improving
 JohnCM: but so are the top 100 silver ppl
 struct: 6977 players euler prediction was on point
 emh: my best was rank 1 in Silver, but that was a few days ago
 emh: now I'm around 50
 JohnCM: man.. you should have risen up back then
 JohnCM: now it's much harder
 emh: yes
 Mohammadmh: چه جوری کوه رو حل کنم
 struct: English please
 eulerscheZahl: with that prediction i'll quit the cristall ball business&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: crystal*
 Icebox: eulerscheZahl predict my final rank
 Astrobytes: hm? Contest participants?
 Mohammadmh: what are solve the mountian pazzle
 struct: 30th
 Beresta: any way to make codingame less laggy / more responsive? annoying to wait several secs each time I get back to browser&#160;:(
 dbdr: push eulerscheZahl push!&#160;:)
 Mohammadmh: in payhon
 Astrobytes: close the IDE window often Beresta
 eulerscheZahl: am i losing to you dbdr?
 dbdr: 3-1
 Mohammadmh: 3
 dbdr: and same rank
 Beresta: Astrobytes you mean refresh page? or is there any way to close IDE? :O 
 eulerscheZahl: where do all these paython programmers suddenly come from?
 dbdr: in legend?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm slowly getting frustrated about the contest.
 eulerscheZahl: no, PAYthon
 JohnCM: euler you in legend alr?
 Astrobytes: Beresta: close it completely and open in another tab, I think it's pixi that crashes the tab after a while
 eulerscheZahl: yesderday someone wrote that on chat
 JohnCM: lol paython
 eulerscheZahl: today again (well, payhon, close enough)
 Beresta: hm I see
 Icebox: rockstar wrote that yesterday
 AllYourMCTS: paython?
 dbdr: payathon
 Icebox: he always wrote "paython"
 eulerscheZahl: yes JohnCM, legend
 Icebox: xD
 Mohammadmh: penis

 JohnCM: it's probably a paid version of python
 eulerscheZahl: floating around rank 20 which is the tshirt bar
 Astrobytes: papayahon
 JohnCM: congrats euler! you're doing great again
 Icebox: refrain from using foul language Mohammadmh
 eulerscheZahl: too late, he got kicked and can't read it anymore
 Icebox: :D
 Icebox: yeah I type to slow
 JohnCM: one day i'll make it to legend
 eulerscheZahl: thanks JohnCM
 Icebox: there goes "warning first"
 eulerscheZahl: weren't you legend last contest?
 JohnCM: nah i was gold only
 struct: I needed to warn?
 JohnCM: didn't break the speed barrier as i was using python
 struct: sorry lol
 struct: I think he knows the cause
 Icebox: no you don't I guess
 Icebox: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: general guideline: warn -&gt; kick -&gt; ban
 Astrobytes: I think no warning is fair when someone just types something like that&#160;;)
 JohnCM: but now things have changed, i am using c++ now
 Icebox: euler just did a rundown for me
 eulerscheZahl: in extreme cases you can skip 1 or 2 steps
 Icebox: how modding works
 Icebox: :D
 JohnCM: but still struggling to get gold lol... it's not the program, it's the algo
 eulerscheZahl: i switched to C++ too
 eulerscheZahl: sadly necessary this time
 JohnCM: yea.. c++ needed for greater depths
 JohnCM: 57 and 50% more battles to go.. come on, let me win more
 JohnCM: oh yea.. rank 44 now
 BrunoFelthes: WoW, a Java in 4th, nice... I was trying to be the best java... but 4th will be impossible
 eulerscheZahl: obviously it is possible
 BrunoFelthes: I have no much more time
 JohnCM: lol
 Csipcsirip: dont worry pb4 is mid submit. so he's only 5th
 Icebox: remember, paython is in legend :eyes:
 BrunoFelthes: @eulerscheZahl for me ... 
 JohnCM: i'm really curious how the python code made it to legend
 Astrobytes: The Power of Payhon
 JohnCM: what legendary heuristics did he/she use
 JohnCM: watching my rank rise is like watching the stock market
 Astrobytes: stonks
 Icebox: funny story
 JohnCM: oh i'm in the 30s now
 JohnCM: rank 36:)
 Icebox: there was a hackathon in Kosice, slovakia 
 JohnCM: this is a new record
 Icebox: like a couple months ago
 eulerscheZahl: thrilling story :popcorn:
 Icebox: and couple weeks before the start they announced you couldn't participate live there 
 Icebox: because of covid
 eXhaustedUA: JohnCM are you cpp?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the one where you qualified for?
 Icebox: yeah yeah
 eulerscheZahl: and you paid traveling expenses
 Icebox: yeah the same one
 Icebox: :D
 Icebox: long story short
 Icebox: I didn't want to burden my team
 Icebox: because the plan was to work together
 BrunoFelthes: eulerscheZahl, how many nodes are you visiting?
 Icebox: but they were already together and me in germany
 Icebox: so I worked alone
 eulerscheZahl: about 150k
 BrunoFelthes: wow
 Icebox: and demotivated by the fact that I don't have a team I made a troll submission called "Stonks"
 Icebox: about stock market and fund management
 Icebox: that got 5th place :D
 Astrobytes: Did it win
 Astrobytes: LOL
 Astrobytes: brilliant
 BrunoFelthes: funny history, when i increase the deep of my algo, the algo perform worst... I'm visiting +- 10k
 Icebox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://devpost.com/software/stonks-14y6n3">https://devpost.com/software/stonks-14y6n3</a>
 eulerscheZahl: my c# was around 50-60k nodes
 BrunoFelthes: what is the deep?
 eulerscheZahl: 15-20
 Astrobytes: well played Icebox. Did your team get a placement at all?
 Icebox: #1&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: lol, well, some consolation at least
 BrunoFelthes: but, do you consider, some how, the new brews?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 BrunoFelthes: so, what is the point to get 15-20 deep? because with 10-15, 3 to 5 brews will go away...
 SirLoxley: how do you get that many nodes?My BFS (with heuristics) hardly generates 500 and then I have seen it all
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i could try a wider beam and see
 Icebox: BrunoFelthes because if your inventory state is good enough you can reach any potion in 2-3 moves
 BrunoFelthes: that is my point Icebox, at legend, you and your opponent, so, with 15 turns, there is no brews anymore, so, why to calculate 20?
 Csipcsirip: most games last 30-40 turns
 BrunoFelthes: yes... 
 Csipcsirip: so thats the point of 20 depth
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i should switch to chokudai search
 chokudai: XD
 eulerscheZahl: oh, hi
 BrunoFelthes: Csipcsirip are you using what deep?
 chokudai: hi
 eulerscheZahl: i still remember your 1 day till legend in the last contest
 Csipcsirip: fix 15. and yep, im using chokudaisearch btw :p
 BrunoFelthes: what is chokudai search?
 eulerscheZahl: fixed depth, dynamic width
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/chokudai/status/713979313377255425">https://twitter.com/chokudai/status/713979313377255425</a>
 eulerscheZahl: a bit like beam search bit changing the static and variable thing
 eulerscheZahl: but*
 BrunoFelthes: i think that i am using it
 BrunoFelthes: i'm not sure what is the width
 Nerchio: so at the start you go depth then width?
 Nerchio: or smth like this
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Csipcsirip: iterative widening :p
 BrunoFelthes: I do i with width 0
 BrunoFelthes: what width do you use?
 Losh531: hi
 Csipcsirip: with width 0 this algo does nothing
 Presac: From when exactly do I have 50ms to do what I want in the fall challenge?
 Csipcsirip: I increase the width after every iteration.
 BoBot: could it be described as DFS with max_depth? or am I missing something
 ClockSort: Presac from first readline
 eulerscheZahl: after reading the first line of input till the print of your action
 ClockSort: ^
 BrunoFelthes: why the width is important at chokudai?
 Presac: Thanks. 
 eulerscheZahl: less time checking with higher width
 BrunoFelthes: i will try to add width 1
 BrunoFelthes: are you using 1?
 JohnCM: i like that term. iterative widening
 Csipcsirip: I start with width 1 and increase it after every iteration 
 Csipcsirip: not sure if its the good why or i should set it to something like fix 50
 JohnCM: what C++ function can i use to time?
 JohnCM: like to stop the loop when time is up
 geppoz:  elapsed=(clock()-beginTime)*1000/CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
 geppoz: this is my noob one
 geppoz: but it works
 Csipcsirip: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1dc41ac6-1a08-4bab-ba5e-68db0ca03fbb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1dc41ac6-1a08-4bab-ba5e-68db0ca03fbb</a>
 eulerscheZahl: clock() has some precision issues i think. at least i had problems with it in the past
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/nQQQa8">https://ideone.com/nQQQa8</a>here ChokudaiWidth never change&#160;:/
 DomiKo: ohhh
 DomiKo: never mind
 eulerscheZahl: csipcsi just modified it. is that allowed?
 JohnCM: thanks euler
 Csipcsirip: no, i did not! I copied from somwhere else :D
 Nerchio: so you guys change the width parameter in the whole search
 Nerchio: but maybe it could be based on the number of potions done in the game? the more the wider you go instead of deeper
 Csipcsirip: dont think it matter much tbh
 JohnCM: ok i got it
 JohnCM: the clock thing
 JohnCM: how is it possible that the boss is not dropping for silver!
 JohnCM: pretty sure he lost many battles against the top 100
 JohnCM: just like me
 eulerscheZahl: but also won a lot
 eulerscheZahl: and stronger players get promoted
 Presac: Poor boss. Never have a chance to be promoted
 AshKetchum: JohnCM, here is a class I wrote after watching reCurse's stream
 AshKetchum: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/uQqj4sza">https://pastebin.com/uQqj4sza</a>
 AshKetchum: Usage:Timer timer;timer.start();while (timer.isElapsed(0.04)): // 40 ms
 JohnCM: thanks, basically functions to start clock and check time elapsed
 AshKetchum: yes
 LLG: wow I really need to improve my bot
 JohnCM: yup got it!
 LLG: I lose to ppl in gold 80-90% of the time
 JohnCM: haha this competition is mad
 JohnCM: how do people even code so efficiently
 AshKetchum: don't call isElapsed in every iteration, call once in say 200 or so iterations
 JohnCM: ok
 SirLoxley: I would love to get there first ... is it possible to win against the silver bot without using that 1s calc time upfront?
 LLG: wdym 1st calc time
 LLG: like preprocessing stuff before 1st turn?
 SirLoxley: yep
 LLG: if that's the case I never did it
 LLG: and still made it to gold
 SirLoxley: because I don't so far
 LLG: I just do regular bfs
 LLG: heuristics go a long way
 Nerchio: i will donate $5 for better CG servers
 Nerchio: where can i do that
 Nerchio: :D
 fermeaux: And what is the goal of your bfs&#160;?
 struct: 1st doesnt matter much imo
 LLG: my bfs at the moment find the shortest path to each recipe
 LLG: then try to maximize points/turn
 LLG: unless 1 player is at 5 potion then I maximize for the endgame
 LLG: depending on the situation (both at 5, me at 5, opponent at 5)
 fermeaux: interesting
 wlesavo: Csipcsirip did you finish your minimax? :slight_smile:
 hbouillo: Hey:) Is there anyone here doing MCTS? If so, would you mind sharing your rollout rate per turn?
 LLG: I thought about MCTS but decided against it since it sounded like a lot of work
 LLG: especially considering I didn't know what it was prior to this event
 AllYourMCTS: i'm just doing random depth 1 rollouts
 AllYourMCTS: but im not doing full game rollouts with all the actions, so not sure what rollout rate would tell ya
 Csipcsirip: I have 1 ply "minimax". working on some more serious stuff. not sure if i can finish it, wlesavo
 hbouillo: Same, but seeing my BFS didn't go past silver, I turned towards it :D
 hbouillo: @LLG
 hbouillo: I see @AllYourMCTS
 LLG: if anyone fought against me earlier today in high silver, or right now in low gold
 TheTenYearOldPanda_57c0: why i can't move the pod on coders strike back? can someone teach me?
 LLG: I put some emojis in the commands so analyzing matches become a bit less boring
 LLG: c:
 wlesavo: Csipcsirip i see, nice
 reCurse: 394 computing :D
 SirLoxley: I have spiced up my commands with curses from the fakir fight of "Asterix and the Magic Carpet"
 SirLoxley: Pushan turn you into an old goat!
 geppoz: lol, better from "monley Island"
 geppoz: *Monkey Island
 SirLoxley: yeah had that one first actually, but it didn't quite fit to these sisters
 aStar: =.= hey golds, which algorithms are you use?  
 SirLoxley: you fight like a dairy farmer ...
 struct: aStar bfs
 ClockSort: aStar bfs
 aStar: wow
 Icebox: damn you use astar?
 Icebox: :D
 Michael_Howard: @LLG my console is full of them. Makes it much more intuitive to follow what's going on.
 aStar: =.= i just use depth-limited search
 aStar: i can't reach gold
 ClockSort: usually silver bfs just have fewer sims than gold bfs
 ClockSort: i am running 100k-150k sims, depth around 8-10
 aStar: wow
 ClockSort: and in c# :laughing:
 aStar: my depth just only 4 =.=
 LLG: @Michael_Howard I just put them on the chat bubble since I can't be arsed to look at the console unless I'm debugging something
 LLG: when I'm just analyzing my bot's playstyle I rarely check the console
 Nerchio: 412 results found for «Score - Computing»
 aStar: @Icebox i can't find a heuristics
 Counterbalance: struct, did you get pushed or made an improvement? I knew you'd pass my bot once in gold&#160;:)
 struct: I got pushed Counterbalance
 aStar: @LLG
 eulerscheZahl: no waking up without gold
 yhyoxx:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: the boring version of "no sleep till legend"
 aStar: @LLG anh ơi anh work team nào v ạ
 struct: I had script to run the alarm only when I got gold
 Counterbalance: really?&#160;:)
 aStar: haha
 struct: nah, but maybe an idea for next time
 struct: Should I use all my threads for brutaltester?
 struct: or is not ideal?
 aStar: have anyone used A*, minimax, or alpha-beta prunning?
 Counterbalance: you'd definitely need to patch the cg engine for that.. I recommend leaving at least 1 or 2 threads free..
 struct: ok thanks
 struct: I only managed to make it run on windows&#160;:/
 LLG: @aStar I'm still in my probationary period in Viacar
 ZarthaxX: Csipcsirip you are top 10 with some kind of 1 ply minmax??
 ZarthaxX: you kidding me
 Astrobytes: hey Zarthy
 eulerscheZahl: on top of high depth chokudaisearch
 Csipcsirip: ^
 ZarthaxX: ahhh ok, all good
 LordSkaven: Ok so I found my problem with my BFS the best path it could find was 217 turns long lol
 ZarthaxX: hey astrobyto&#160;:*
 Skynse: dfs or bfs?
 Skynse: oh
 Skynse: "breadth" first search
 LLG: very broad, indeed
 Astrobytes: I don't know whether to continue trying to speed-write my sim + search or just leave it
 yhyoxx: same
 yhyoxx: 17 hours 
 LLG: in my case working on heuristics gave me much better results
 yhyoxx: do ur best it's gonna be over soon
 LLG: I'm doing 4k sims per turn at best
 Astrobytes: I got to silver with just a reflex agent but I reached a "fk it" point lol
 yhyoxx: same
 LLG: I reached silver with a super scuffed bfs
 LLG: decided to rewrite my entire code
 LLG: it became a less scuffed bfs, lol
 Astrobytes: I didn't even bother doing a bfs lol, been lacking motivation this time
 Nerchio: well advancing from gold is impossible now unless you have godly bot
 LLG: my goal is only high gold anyway
 LLG: first time experiencing some kind of competitive programming so I'm not aiming too high
 LLG: I'm happy with mid-high gold
 Samer: LLG what are you using to store the ingredients?
 yhyoxx: i just wanna leave silver
 LLG: uhh... just an array of 4 integers
 LLG: the regular way, I guess
 yhyoxx: i think what i need to beat the boxx is a good choice of potions to target
 Samer: and to store spells and potions? lists or arrays?
 yhyoxx: predicting the opponent
 yhyoxx: vector&lt;Action&gt;
 LLG: I use lists
 LLG: I honestly don't care that much, since I'm not duplicating the whole list anyway
 yhyoxx: cool
 LLG: so performance is not a huge issue for me
 Samer: dump the lists, use jagged arrays, you're likely to double your sim count
 Samer: at least that was the case with me
 Astrobytes: alright, afk for a bit, making bread and spaghetti
 LLG: my sims are fast
 LLG: I just don't do a lot of sims
 yhyoxx: hmm
 LLG: well, not exactly fast, just not slow lol
 Icebox: how fast is "not slow"?
 Samer: 4k sims per turn?
 LLG: I'm only doing around 4k sims per turn, but I rarely exceed 10ms a turn anyway
 Icebox: that's extremely slow :D
 therealbeef: :D adding one forgotten reserve() halved my running time
 Icebox: 400/ms
 Icebox: others get 40k/ms
 Icebox: so I'd say that's slow
 Samer: you wanna go extreme, store all 4 of them in an int and use bit shift
 AllYourMCTS: is that 40k/ms number with both players until end of game?
 LLG: I mean it's still 5x faster than my old scuffed bfs so I'm happy with it
 AllYourMCTS: or just 40k single action applications/ms?
 Icebox: depends on the person you ask
 Icebox: I'm just giving numbers
 LLG: I'm sure there are a lot of ways I can improve my sims but sim count isn't my focus right now
 Icebox: the implementations are different
 Icebox: the numbers are similar
 LLG: I do use bit shift, just not for ingredients
 Samer: LLG i actually agree with you
 Samer: 4k sims got me in gold too
 LLG: I just a bit field to store my spell states
 geppoz: uh oh, just notice I forgot to increase the rewards on lower tome spell when I learn &gt;0
 Samer: because i optimized other aspects
 LLG: (castable/not castable)
 geppoz: *lowers tome spells
 LLG: I use* a bit field
 Samer: llg
 Samer: best optimization i made was choosing the right tome spells to learn
 Samer: and that's still a work in progress
 LLG: mine's really simple as well
 LLG: I look at bottom 3
 LLG: if there's a free spell (no negative delta) I grab it
 LLG: else I grab whichever one has the best value
 LLG: most of the time I just grab the bottom one cause it's free
 Samer: best value, or best value to your existing spells?&#160;;)
 geppoz: I suppose you didn't see the Euler epic: "learn just to pay dat tax" :D
 LLG: actually forget about that
 LLG: I scrapped all of my learning heuristics a while ago
 LLG: just realized it now when I looked at my code
 LLG: right now I'm just grabbing all-positive spells in the bottom 3
 LLG: else I grab the bottom 1 til I have 12 spells
 geppoz: it was something really
 Icebox: that happens hella often tho
 Icebox: as in
 Icebox: that's really important to have

 BrunoFelthes: wow
 BrunoFelthes: fastest game ever?
 BrunoFelthes: my AI with the same seed get 27 turns
 BrunoFelthes:&#160;:(
 JohnCM: wow euler your inventory is almost full all the time
 JohnCM: max efficiency
 BrunoFelthes: why do you draft 5 tomos eulerscheZahl? Any rules?
 eulerscheZahl: tomos?
 BrunoFelthes: learn
 eulerscheZahl: no fixed rules here
 BrunoFelthes: humm
 eulerscheZahl: oh no, Magus submittedthat was my reference if i'm improving or not
 kreo: hahaha
 Magus: :D
 BrunoFelthes: maybe you will gain something
 eulerscheZahl: magus put back the old version!
 Magus: wow ... submits are ... very slow
 eulerscheZahl: almost staff ping slow again
 eulerscheZahl: i mean sunday staff ping
 kreo: I thought the mot reliable way to tell if you are improving is to play ~100 games against the old version
 BrunoFelthes: because the blind draft will help with the current brew and the new  randons.. I just dont know the best balance
 Michael_Howard: Is there a way to have the codingame web IDE show 2 windows of your code with changes trasferring?
 eulerscheZahl: too much rock paper scissors for self-play
 eulerscheZahl: and 100 isn't taht much
 kreo: I bet you don't play 100 games against Magus, do ya?
 eulerscheZahl: a diff between bot versions? no
 eulerscheZahl: i don't
 eulerscheZahl: i click the yellow button
 eulerscheZahl: and then wait 2h
 struct: im doing around 1k is that enough
 kreo: And what if after 2h you see that you haven't improved or even lost quality? What do you do to debug?
 eulerscheZahl: 1k what? submits?
 LLG: lol euler flexing on us
 LLG: with that 25 turn game
 rmuskovets: looks like the submits situation is getting ok
 rmuskovets: there definitely is a problem with my code
 Nerchio: kappa?
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair that was mostly blue+green. 25 frames but low score
 rmuskovets: I timeout too much&#160;:((
 eulerscheZahl: some timeouts are normal, CG has problems
 rmuskovets: I mean nearly 80% of my games are 0-turn because I timeout
 ClockSort: that's too many&#160;;)
 rmuskovets: yeah
 rmuskovets: I'll consider rewriting to another language
 rmuskovets: Kotlin seems like a good choice
 LLG: I just tried that seed
 LLG: Link404 won against me in 37 turns, 95 to 44 lol
 LLG: I still have a long way to go
 NinjaDoggy: :O I got pushed to legend overnight
 NinjaDoggy: I was like 2.5 pts away from boss after submit dang...
 NinjaDoggy: thx ryzen! :D
 NinjaDoggy: Risen*
 struct: grats
 NinjaDoggy: nice, you made gold too!
 ToshiTuringMachine: that red timer...
 struct: 17 hours lets go
 eulerscheZahl: good news NinjaDoggy, now you don't have to delete your account
 NinjaDoggy: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: wait till it starts blinking toshi
 NinjaDoggy: dw i have some sick improvements today
 NinjaDoggy: gonna be top 20&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: you have some sick confidence at elast :D
 ToshiTuringMachine: this contest really destroyed my self esteem. still in silver fighting timeouts
 struct: rank 1 or delete /ss
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 MadKnight: only one account stays on CG after the contest ends
 ZarthaxX: not everybody is like u structo
 struct: This time I had to set goal lower
 struct: No way I can get legend in this contest
 ZarthaxX: hahaha :P
 ZarthaxX: coward
 geppoz: 1st in Italy or delete here :D
 LLG: did Errichto cancel his stream today?
 LLG: he should be live right now right?
 struct: yes canceled I check on his stream now
 struct: "[canceled] CodinGame Day 4 - Legend League"
 LLG: rip
 kovi: maybe legend was too hard for him? (just jking)
 LLG: I was thinking maybe I could get some ideas from watching it
 LLG: but I guess I'm on my own now
 ZarthaxX: kovi he is in silver
 ZarthaxX: maybe he didnt like it
 struct: he was 2nd and did not get pushed&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: yeah, i saw that, multiple times
 ZarthaxX: super sad
 wlesavo: chokudai is still not in legend, that is surprising
 struct: lets go
 struct: time to stat
 rmuskovets: is rewriting from typescript to kotlin worth the time?
 MenoIy: Its me or no one is getting out of the silver&#160;? 
 Cappefra: My theory is silver is so crowded it's really hard to write a bot that does well against bottom mid and top silver
 Cappefra: but it's more likely that I simply suck
 MenoIy: true and sad&#160;:(
 casmith789: I managed to just get out of silver yesterday but it required a lot of optimisation
 MenoIy: I'm getting out of ideas  :/
 ZarthaxX: running out
 dreadylein: same, the boss is slightly boosted by the submits but if you win consistnely against him you get out
 Nerchio: come on bot
 Nerchio: you can do it
 MenoIy: Im winning against him  like 80% of times but Im stuck at the mid 
 Nerchio: just one time lucky pls :D
 DomiKo: yes you can!
 Nerchio: i probably jinxed myself
 Nerchio: that was a bad idea
 jrke: are battles slow?
 Nerchio: yeah since 2 days
 Nerchio: :D
 delineate: does anyone know how the end of the contest works? are all scores reset before the final set of games are played or not?
 Icebox: just for the top players
 NinjaDoggy: the scores are kept i believe
 NinjaDoggy: as the starting point
 jrke: just for legend they had megarun for 500 battles
 Icebox: well yeah he's right, the scores are kept but the code is resubmitted
 struct: but score starts where you end up
 struct: If you have 25.00 when rerun starts you start with that score
 delineate: ah, I see. interesting, thanks. and it's using a trueskill for the score? (so at the end, everyone's variances are set high like a fresh submission (but with the current means? or is it something else))
 struct: variances are kept I think
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, increasing variance an 1000 extra battles
 struct: oh i was mistaken
 struct: I never reached legend so I dont know&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i should look into trueskill again, how do you call the confidence there?
 eulerscheZahl: increase sigma for recalc
 delineate: okay yeah cool. was trying to understand if there was a disadvantage to submitting late (as your variance will be higher than people who submitted earlier), but it sounds like that isn't the case
 wlesavo: legend soon will exceed ooc numbers, but the contest is far more popular
 rmuskovets: my code timeouts far less often now, yay!
 struct: already 60 in legend
 struct: damn
 rmuskovets: looks like I got a OK-ish bot now
 rmuskovets: at least I'm not the worst in bronze
 ParticleBeam: Why does nothing work...
 Kiat: so many submit for silver now... 
 Kiat: system lag again
 MadKnight: really?
 rmuskovets: doesn't look like it lags for me
 MadKnight: they mean the submits
 rmuskovets: I know
 Kiat: BATTLES IN PROGRESS 46%
 Uemu: Ye I'm stuck after the first 10 matchs
 Kiat: stuck for 20mins
 Kiat: silver boss getting beat to positino 9 now
 rmuskovets: I won't sleep 'till my battles are done... this makes me happy - I'm in the top 1000 *in bronze* for the 1st time
 rmuskovets: *knocks on a piece of wood*
 MenoIy: Get me out of silverhell pleassse
 dreadylein: grats&#160;:)
 Uemu: I wanna get out of silver tooooo, end my first contest in gold 
 Samer: will this game be available later for play?
 Illedan: Yes
 Samer: great
 wlesavo: especially with pm wisdom
 jrke: did c++ got broked on submission?
 jrke: all timeouts just on resubmits
 Samer: it's funny when you change your code to make it smarter and less random, you submit and lose 100 ranks&#160;:) i guess randomness can be useful sometimes
 Apologize: how can i prove i'm not a bot
 LordSkaven: Ironicly, by coding a bot Apologize
 geppoz: next contest: a bot that outputs code for another bot :D
 geppoz: input: minigame rules
 geppoz: wow not bad uh?
 Apologize: so cool
 dreadylein: so General Game Play Competion&#160;? :P
 Zenoscave: NLP time right geppoz
 eulerscheZahl: lateGame = Players[0].SamplesFinished &lt; 2;
 Icebox: huh, samples
 Icebox: what is this, C4L
 Zenoscave: lol Icebox
 struct: Icebox submit already
 eulerscheZahl: using c4l terminology in the contest :D
 Icebox: but I did struct
 Icebox: only testing the sim alone but I did submit :3
 eulerscheZahl: when gold?
 Icebox: probably this submit, if not I'll submit same sim with different params
 Icebox: I need to finetune sim without all the other logic so that I can debug clearly
 Icebox: sim = eval I mean
 struct: I think current 1st on silver
 struct: will go straight to legend
 kotamanegi: Really? GoGo!!
 eulerscheZahl: defaultAI is submitting and ranked above you Icebox
 Icebox: sick
 Icebox: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 MadKnight: default too strong
 MadKnight: too icy
 jrke: icy was first at one moment 
 MadKnight: not enough icy
 miszu: how's everyone doing?
 yhyoxx: terrible
 miszu: the sound of defeat
 Samer: pretty good here
 miszu: I went into UTTT
 miszu: Samer how's gold for you?
 eulerscheZahl: getting frustrated
 Samer: i'm not making progress in gold.. my silver code is still better than the "improvements" i made today
 Samer: i got plenty of ideas, but not enough time to execute
 ClockSort: i just had a breakthrough after adding 4 major features that worsened my bot. 
 Beresta: yea same stuff, my current gold bot is still worth than the one that carried me into gold :D 
 Rounddice: I don't understand why my old code performs the new one by so much
 ClockSort: making your bot worse is a common hobby, it seems&#160;:)
 Beresta: but I've rewrote it completely from heuristics to beam search
 Beresta: potential is there
 wlesavo: Rounddice it can be lucky submits also
 ClockSort: sometimes a new submission takes a long time to rank up to where it belongs, so it seems worse.
 Samer: not when you lose the first 15 battles :D that's a pretty good sign you belong in the bottom
 Samer: i'm sticking to my silver code for now
 NinjaDoggy: what exactly is default AI?
 NinjaDoggy: do they pick someone's code to be default AI?
 ClockSort: yeah i think so
 ClockSort: and ironically they were named Default.
 ClockSort: in gold they're named Link404 which really confused me
 NinjaDoggy: I know that bosses are picked from someone's code
 NinjaDoggy: but idk about default AI(the bot you have by default in the highest divison)
 JFB: ClockSort - sb can think it is strange type of hobby - spend Sunday writing worse version of your bot. But it really look so it is my hobby too ...
 struct: Gold is not deterministic right?
 struct: Gold boss*
 JFB: It look so 
 JFB: *looks
 struct: I think I really need to add pruning
 miszu: s it not wrong that it is true that
 miszu: Is it not wrong that it is true that the gold boss is not deterministic, correct?
 JFB: Is it true that it is not wrong that it is true that the gold boss is not deterministic, is it Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: tankers spawn with 1 water
 ParticleBeam: This statement is false.
 rmuskovets: &gt; is it true that it is not wrong that it is true that ...
 miszu: my history teacher in a multiple choice exam made a joke question with that statement but in French.
 Astrobytes: 2 hour submits...
 rmuskovets: wow, rank 466! I've never been so high
 miszu: grats
 rmuskovets: ty
 miszu: I am 1946
 miszu: top 2000
 rmuskovets: in what league? I'm 466 in bronze
 Astrobytes: oh, he means overall
 miszu: oh sorry I mean overall
 miszu: across all league
 JFB: At first I think that you are from 1946&#160;:-)
 JFB: 1946 year
 sadakatsu: I have long thought that the solution to statements like, "This statement is false," is to implement a rule that any assertion that reflexively refers to its own evaluation should be inherently false.
 miszu: Hi all, I came from 1946. How's 2020?
 JFB: So far great&#160;:-)
 rmuskovets: go to 2019. the grass was greener, trees taller, etc.
 ParticleBeam: Suddenly all oscillators stop working
 JFB: covid?
 struct: Ok I need to submit soon
 struct: and hope I get pushed
 miszu: which league are you?
 NinjaDoggy: yea pushing is pretty important
 struct: gold
 NinjaDoggy: i got pushed 2.5 points
 JFB: It is 14 hours to the end - so 7 submits&#160;:-)
 geppoz: struct you aim to legend now? :D
 struct: Ill try, but its not really a goal
 Zenoscave: I left my debug time limit in my last submit
 emh: I've given up on Gold
 ParticleBeam: Bah. My rewrite fails miserably.
 emh: staying in Silver
 rmuskovets: NinjaDoggy 2.5? do you mean rank?
 Zenoscave: 45M ms
 NinjaDoggy: no, 2.5 points lol
 struct: lol
 NinjaDoggy: i was 2.5ish points away from boss after submit
 Zenoscave: turns out that's too long
 NinjaDoggy: and got pushed up to legend XD
 rmuskovets: I actually thought 2.5 was the rank
 struct: ok im gonna add enemy now
 struct: then prune
 Zenoscave: prune first
 Zenoscave: Enemy is high gold/ legend
 JFB: Yes, prune first.
 Zenoscave: Been telling you that for days lol
 JFB: My bot with added enemy works worse
 Zenoscave: 2 days exactly
 struct: True
 struct: But 2 days ago I rewrote
 rmuskovets: 14hr 43mn left, I hope I'll not get lower...
 struct: :p
 Zenoscave: :P i see
 struct: Ok I cant be in chat or I lose focus
 struct: Cya
 Zenoscave: Bye struct
 Zenoscave: glhf
 struct: u2
 ZarthaxX: 7000 participants
 ZarthaxX: :O
 rmuskovets: yeah, that's a lot
 struct: very nice
 struct: congrats to cg
 Zenoscave: struct leave chat!!! You need to focus
 struct: sorry
 BrunoFelthes: 7k participants, and servers are stucked&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: Yeah My submit gets 1 battle a minute or 2
 miszu: how slow are sumissions?
 BrunoFelthes: 4 hours i think
 Zenoscave: 4 HOURS!?
 BrunoFelthes: my submition 2 hours ago is at 50%
 miszu: do you think the deadline will be extended?
 Zenoscave: Will the extend competition if it takes too long? They've done it once
 Astrobytes: no
 BrunoFelthes: for sure no
 Zenoscave: drats
 kotamanegi: For sure no
 Astrobytes: have they? Oh well, maybe, who knows
 Zenoscave: I believe it was the locam sprint. but I can't recall.
 Zenoscave: but it was a severe situation so most likely no
 Astrobytes: don't think they extended that did they?
 Astrobytes: All I know it was a clusterfk :D
 Zenoscave: it was something. Cant remember which one been so long
 Astrobytes: wow, submits from around 3:40-ish still going
 Nerchio: in legend?
 BrunoFelthes: CG should have a paid version for a faster submision
 particleflux: mine from 4:30 in bronze also still running, seems like I'm gonna end up *right below* the boss -.-
 Astrobytes: yeah Nerchio
 Nerchio: nope
 Nerchio: dont jinx me
 Nerchio: i was already here 2 submits ago :D
 k7n: i losing on submit because my code is timing out and when i rerun the same battle in the ide it doesn't timeout
 geppoz: usual in these days...
 k7n: I already hamstrung my bfs by shaving of 3 ms but it's still happening at least 2 out of 10 battles at the moment
 k7n: c'est la vie, i really had fun with this competition even if I'm only silver
 Beresta: damn, scoring is hard
 LLG: I just realize something is not right with my points/turn heuristic
 ZarthaxX: wat :P
 LLG: let's say I can brew a 20 points potion in 5 turn, and a 8 points potion in 3 turns; the first 2 moves for both paths are the same
 LLG: technically the 20pts is better, because 20/5 &gt; 8/3
 LLG: but after 2 moves
 LLG: it becomes 20/3 &lt; 8/1
 Zenoscave: I tried telling this to you last night&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: Harmonic sums weigh revers
 Zenoscave: reversed
 Q12: So how can solve it? @LLG
 Q12: I am doing exactly like you and I suspected there was a problem in it, Love to hear what you will do :slight_smile:
 theycallmedavid: Don't forget where did you start from
 dbdr: that start eulerscheZahl&#160;:+1:
 Zenoscave: there's two options both are viable but meh
 TC9792: dont change it if you already have a target potion?
 Zenoscave: *3 options ^
 wlesavo: euler coming for top1
 ParticleBeam: Add the existing game step counter to your depth value?
 wlesavo: dam sorry for ruining perfect submit euler :smiley:
 Zenoscave: no just total points / total turns or sum(order.price * pow(1.0-discount, order.turns) for order in order)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Zenoscave: discount should be very very small
 Zenoscave: but greater than zero
 eulerscheZahl: is urgency bonus worth adding to the sim?
 eulerscheZahl: seems unreliable with opponent interfering
 Csipcsirip: dont think so
 ParticleBeam: Isn't it already included in the price?
 Zenoscave: That's why their both meh
 eulerscheZahl: ParticleBeam for later potions when you remove one with bonus
 ParticleBeam: Ah ok
 SabertheLost: wow takes 1 hour to play all battles now
 eulerscheZahl: only 1?
 eulerscheZahl: you must be in wood
 dbdr: What did you do eulerscheZahl?&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: sit tight and wait&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: rage repush an old version
 Csipcsirip: ichyo submitted almost 3 hours ago xd
 dbdr: really? :D
 ZarthaxX: frustrated toad?
 eulerscheZahl: yes ZarthaxX, i'm pretty much done with the game
 ZarthaxX: you got what you wanted toad, it's fine right? :D
 eulerscheZahl: i want that tshirt
 dbdr: again?
 ZarthaxX: you got many..
 dbdr: is there a new one?
 wlesavo: my version that got to #6 yeasterday cant reach 30 now. also tryed to rage push that one couple of times :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: it's just that i haven't won anything in 2020
 LordSkaven: you have won my admiration euler :heart_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: codejam? nopekotlin heroes? yes but retour to russia
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC? no tshirts this time
 eulerscheZahl: oh, nice LordSkaven. this will totally keep me warm in the winter :D
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Icebox: Zenoscave the total turns vs total score is tragic, no hate &lt;3
 Zenoscave: what do you mean tragic?
 Zenoscave: only love Icebox
 Icebox: imagine you're in late game (turn 45 or 44 or something), you have 30ish points and have two options
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl go do ctfs and change the topic :P
 wlesavo: MichaelPu gratz!
 ZarthaxX: Icebox wassup bro
 Icebox: 10 score potion in 1 turn or 11 score potion in 2 turns
 Icebox: according to your "total score/total turns"
 Zenoscave: I prefer to use the discount version
 Icebox: the 11 in 2 is better than 10 in 1
 dbdr: count time from the previous potion
 Icebox: so if the formula fails on such easy cases imo it's not that good :D
 Zenoscave: I agree
 Q12: so which formula do you suggest?
 Zenoscave: I was giving options to solve the harmonic sum
 Icebox: ZarthaxX not much I was gonna change a couple of variables in my code, but you know the moment you change ABSOLUTELY nothing in your code but next time you test it the neighbors house is on fire and your code segfaults?
 Icebox: something like that
 Astrobytes: and Zeno did state they were "meh"
 Zenoscave: meh is right
 BoBot: thinking that you need to keep going for the bigger one sounds like a fallacy.. before you started both targets were in risk of being stolen by the opponent, now only one of them is risky... the ordering must not stay the same throughout the turns but I might be wrong about this - and I am sure there are many cases where we still want to go for the bigger one
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 Zenoscave: Still don't know a non meh
 Astrobytes: looking good so far euler
 Zenoscave: sshhh don't jink
 Zenoscave: jinx*
 Astrobytes: only another 3 hours to find out
 eulerscheZahl: i expect it to rank around 20-25
 Astrobytes: not gonna argue, all your predictions have been 100% this contest :D
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: 1 out of 1
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i predicted Neumann legend
 Astrobytes: sure there was something else too
 Neumann: You also predicted a 1.5 ratio
 wlesavo: 7006! 
 Neumann: 2 out of 3
 Zenoscave: 1.5 ratio?
 Neumann: When he converted his code from C# to C++
 wlesavo: another eulers prediction become true
 Zenoscave: Ah right
 Neumann: 2/3 predictions right, and 0 promises honored
 Zenoscave: did he promise to eat a hat
 Neumann: He said he was going to congratulate my legend promotion. He didn't
 Astrobytes: Shocking!
 Zenoscave: how rude Euler!
 numb3r5: what does it mean when it says "pod 1 of player waits for it's engine to reload"
 eulerscheZahl: you weren't online when i saw you promoted, sorry
 Zenoscave: Is csb disabled right now?
 eulerscheZahl: congrats for reaching legend. i'm not even remotely surprised taht you did
 eulerscheZahl: typing in teh chat is getting laggy again
 Neumann: Thanks euler, appreciated
 Astrobytes: Yeah, congrats from me too. Since we're congratulating :D
 Presac: Why does actions take longer in the arena than when testing?
 Zenoscave: congratz Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: congrats Zenoscave
 Astrobytes: actually, I'll take that. I thought I'd stay in Bronze.
 Astrobytes: Nothing quite like suddenly getting motivated at the *end* of the contest&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Where's robo this time around?
 Zenoscave: lol Astrobytes penultimate peril
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 LLG: Zenoscave what does this do?or sum(order.price * pow(1.0-discount, order.turns) for order in order)
 MadKnight: Zenoscave did u share your code?
 Zenoscave: MadKnight on accident I pasted the top ~1/4th
 eulerscheZahl: robo around 4k it seems. that's unusual for him
 MadKnight: fixit
 Zenoscave: Nothing but the spells were shown. same as Deck.jav
 Zenoscave: Java*
 eulerscheZahl: usually a safe candidate for legend
 Astrobytes: yeah, maybe he's busy or just didn't like it
 MadKnight: write a virus that deletes top-1/4th code fromeveryone's PC
 Zenoscave: LLG waiting makes a potion worth less. but only exponential decay
 Astrobytes: smits was busy and also low level
 eulerscheZahl: he's online. let's ping RoboStac and ask him about his contest performance
 Zenoscave: not linear
 Astrobytes: lol
 Michael_Howard: My bot gets to about #150 in silver without doing any repeatable casts yet - how far can I expect to go up when I add it?
 MadKnight: smits is busy he doesn't play the contest much
 Zenoscave: I'd say gold
 eulerscheZahl: gold++
 MadKnight: #149&#160;? Michael_Howard
 Zenoscave: is it that close silver to legend?
 MadKnight: at least
 eulerscheZahl: legend will be hard, that needs some more bells and whistles than just repeatable spells
 Michael_Howard: Oh, and I get about 16 nodes without serious crashing, that's the 2nd next thing I need to sort&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: next contest should be about optimizing leaderboard submits @_@
 Michael_Howard: scoring is fast but sim has bottleneck
 Astrobytes: profile + optimise
 Michael_Howard: Got to do all the low hanging fruit that might require a brain before it gets to midnight &amp; all-nighter time...
 MadKnight: people are in legend with python
 LLG: @Zenoscavefrom what I understand, the order.price * pow(1.0-discount, order.turns) decreases the recipe value by amount of turns to reach it
 LLG: what does the sum do?
 Zenoscave: adds all the completed sums together
 Zenoscave: depends on how you track orders brewed ig
 LLG: so I'm essentially calculating distance towards all recipe 
 LLG: right?
 Zenoscave: no just ones you complete
 LLG: oh, like the completed ones
 Zenoscave: yup
 LLG: gotcha
 LLG: I calculate all of those post-BFS
 Michael_Howard: If I can get Swift into legend I'll be so happy&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: not optimal but it should help
 LLG: so I don't have a list of completed potions
 Zenoscave: do you track current state's score?
 AntiSquid: 2 people MadKnight 
 AntiSquid: are in legend with py
 LLG: I do
 Zenoscave: add a decay score to track for sorting in bfs
 LLG: oh wait
 LLG: I don't track every states in the bfs, just the root state lol
 LLG: my bfs only does 1 thing, get shortest paths towards every potion
 LLG: all the heuristics comes after BFS returns
 Zenoscave: and not second or third potions?
 LLG: all 5 potions actually
 LLG: I scan all possible inventory states, then get the shortest paths towards the states that can afford each potion
 Zenoscave: smart.
 LLG: also Zenoscave, by "discount should be very very small"
 LLG: how small are we talking
 Zenoscave: .005-0.1
 LLG: I'll try playing around with those
 Zenoscave: But I've never found a good value that always helps
 LLG: any reason why you prefer it to total points / total turns?
 Zenoscave: Icebox  had a good example
 Zenoscave: 10/1 &gt; 11/2
 Zenoscave: end game points matter more
 AllYourMCTS: total points / 2 * total turns, fixed!
 Zenoscave: lol AllYourMCTS
 BoBot: count turns starting from the end of the game *taps forehead*
 LLG: I have a deterministic solution for endgame scenario (either player at 5 potions)
 LLG: if I'm at 5 I'll rush the closest potion that gives me higher score than my opponent
 LLG: if they're at 5 I'll try to rush a potion, or stack ingredients if I can't rush any fast enough
 miszu: LLG, if your AI is russian add the Rush B option
 ANGGEL: hi
 AntiSquid: what's the reference miszu
 LLG: it's a csgo reference
 miszu: AntiSquid in counter strike game, in dust 2 map russians always rush into B site when terrorists
 miszu: it's a popular reference among gamers
 AntiSquid: was never a fan
 miszu: :P
 AntiSquid: nice improvement Rounddice, become the Edgelord&#160;! 
 AntiSquid: seriously, congratulations on 3rd place
 ClockSort: it's getting hard to climb, everyone else is climbing too!
 miszu: which league?
 ClockSort: or at least, that's what I blame my slow progress on&#160;:)
 Nerchio: &lt;legend&gt;  :)
 Astrobytes: :eyes: eulerscheZahl tho
 miszu: you guys too good
 DomiKo: GJ
 aCat: Grat Nerchio
 Zenoscave: I'm still waiting for emil's comback
 ClockSort: congrats to all Legend players -- it's a great achievement!
 AntiSquid: chodu kai entered the LB
 AntiSquid: 1 day legend again?
 Astrobytes: well done Nerchio!
 eulerscheZahl: oh, looking better than i expected so far
 ClockSort: I'm #50 Gold, really trying to make Legend in the next 13 hours
 miszu: good luck ClockSort
 Nerchio: thanks wasn't so easy to enter legend with java tbh
 miszu: with java?
 miszu: ouff
 AntiSquid: oh gratz nerchio
 Nerchio: im impressed with vala nice results with java
 Michael_Howard: All this talk about rushing potions at the end... why aren't people rushing potions all the way through? Serious question.
 Nerchio: wala*
 miszu: why you kept with java and not c++?
 AntiSquid: he likes java
 ClockSort: thanks miszu
 Nerchio: i was in the middle of rewriting to C++
 Nerchio: but saw wala smashing to the top in java
 Nerchio: so decided to keep going
 Zenoscave: Michael_Howard which is better 15 points now or 20 points in two turns
 eulerscheZahl: potion rush empties your ingredients
 Zenoscave: that's why
 Michael_Howard: @zenoscave ah I see what you mean. Thanks.
 eulerscheZahl: with no ingredients you take more turns to recover
 Michael_Howard: Another good point. Thanks.
 AntiSquid: poor daiver&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: was rooting for him
 mde_deus: hey I need some help with chess board analyzer, how should I make it so the checkmate is identified? 
 Samer: eulerscheZahl did you manage to fit spells and potions into an int32? this is killing me, i can't figure it out
 NitMpez: yeah... I'm trying to come up with ways to push higher... but i can't come up with a good heuristic to do a beam search so still stuck at around depth 8 and unfortunately I rush potions which seems hit or miss, looking to adjust my scoring to handle differently
 Samer: i seem to be 2 bits short
 eulerscheZahl: onl the inventory part of them
 eulerscheZahl: which spells i have is more than 32bit
 Samer: yes that one's easy.. i can even fit the price, but still need 2 bits for castable and repeatable
 Samer: i guess it's impossible
 LLG: I guess I'll submit, watch it for a bit then go to sleep
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i could do a little writeup of my storage after the contest. the rest of my bot really isn't worth writing about
 Zenoscave: Also how you modify to get a new state needs to be considered. Samer
 LLG: it's already 3am for me
 LLG: I need to wake up at 6:45
 wlesavo: Nerchio gratz :slight_smile:
 Nerchio: ty :D
 DomiKo: good start in legend
 Zenoscave: more operations but smaller storage isn't always optimal
 Stilgart: gg Nerchio
 Nerchio: i will grab my spot at the bottom of legend :joy:
 Zenoscave: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 kovi: yeah, pm will be boring mostly
 Zenoscave: TIMEOUT
 eulerscheZahl: i need very few operations for my inventory
 Samer: Zenoscave is have fast routines routines to sum 2 inventories and other operations, one liners
 eulerscheZahl: i know a little of what pb is doing. that could give an interesting read
 Zenoscave: and number of instructions/cycles in this?
 wlesavo: kovi i bet python pm's would be helpful 
 eulerscheZahl: but 20 times "i used beam search and through thousands of simulations steps at the problem", meh
 Q12: @mde_deus check if the king is attacked and if so then check if he can escape, if he can't then this is a sign that there is checkmate.
 Nerchio: i want to know how wala can be in top legend with java :D
 Astrobytes: I'm interested in the more unique approaches, seems there are a few
 Zenoscave: By being better than bottom  legend
 elderlybeginner: I have a feeling that I set wrong objectives. And I have a feeling that I started to understand what to go for.  Bit late to start it over again :joy:
 ClockSort: relevant username
 Zenoscave: .com
 wala: Nerchio arrays and primitives mostly
 eulerscheZahl: how many sims do you get?
 wala: I don't know but but i think the evaluation is rather important in this contest
 Nerchio: yeah my evaluation is average at best
 Nerchio: well i use arrays and bitset and was getting even 200k nodes but it wasn't very useful so i changed to beamsearch and well.. 30k nodes maybe and up to depth 15
 Nerchio: kinda bad compared to other languages :D
 pb4: How many people here have tried to see how their rank is impacted by the number of simulations they get&#160;?
 Zenoscave: o/
 Zenoscave: My sims greatly impact my score
 pb4: Was it impacted much&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: my answer: not that much after some point
 Zenoscave: That means my eval is probably inadmissible
 wlesavo: pb4 i did for montecarlo, 5-15k were almost the same, but this is mid gold
 eulerscheZahl: to some degree you can counter a worse scoring with more CPU power. but there are limitations
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: same answer for me. Can't see a real difference between 30k sim and 150k
 wlesavo: my opp prediction is 1k rollouts mc, it seems to get all the losses right
 NitMpez: really depends i guess... kind of like nerichio mentioned, only gets 30k with beam search but the extra depth is more important... 
 kovi: for mc it did matterfor beam it is notwithout enemy prediction depth over 10+ has diminishing return
 wlesavo: same, i only have around 20k unique nodes, 
 NitMpez: I can't wait to hear what people did for their heuristic on the beam search to get to that depth... everything i implement seems to get to same depth or i just do worse
 Nerchio: i only predict enemy ending 5 turns
 Mike-yerG: hey all! Just a quick question: I'm just using actionId to brew, but once one of us brew that id my witch will still attempt to cast it. Doesn't my actionId refresh each cycle?
 AllYourMCTS: it only refreshes after you use the Rest action
 wlesavo: Mike-yerG you probably dont clear your storing right
 Mike-yerG: I'm new to all this so it would make sense I'm doing something wrong haha.
 Mike-yerG: would setting actionId = 0 after each brew do the trick?
 miszu: so I wrote my UTT game engine without testing it. 200 lines of code. Time to see if it will crash when playing random moves
 Counterbalance: 37m before the timer starts flashing
 Astrobytes: lol miszu, you really did give up on the contest :D
 miszu: *insert 24h tv series sound effect*
 NitMpez: i'm almost there
 miszu: Astrobytes, yeah yesterday I realised I don't have enough time to finish writing my game engine and do bfs
 miszu: I started the competition half way through
 dbf: Mike-yerG, just read everything from input on each step. All spells are provided to you in correct state
 Beresta: and I'd stuck in optimizing my heuristics full day today... seems like the more tunes I do the worse it becomes :D 
 geppoz: my initial idea was to start with values: 1,3,5,7 for ingredients, then change them every time I learn a recipe that make it different
 miszu: next competition I would start right away in C++ and write my game engine from beginning
 Mike-yerG: oki I'll recheck everything. 
 miszu: if you have a correct game engine, the rest is "easy" to test different strategy
 geppoz: so when I learn [-5,0,+3,0] the weight of  3 drops
 Astrobytes: miszu, I didn't do much due to lack of motivation until yesterday, now I'm motivated and don't have time to finish my sim never mind search :D
 Astrobytes: Trying to pick some low-hanging fruit and fix some bugs in my crappy reflex bot
 miszu: motivation is important haha. I find the applying moves to your game engine quite complex. Lots of corner cases to handle

 Zenoscave: lol
 Astrobytes: wlesavo you are now Big In Japan
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 ClosetAI: Is chokudai even trying? Maybe he will come back in last hours. Maybe even Psyho comes back.
 Zenoscave: Psyho I doubt.
 Zenoscave: But he could
 eulerscheZahl: he tweets about slow servers and that he wants to go to bed
 pb4: Psyho&#160;?
 ClosetAI: Psyho complained about TCO finals but that was like 5 days ago
 eulerscheZahl: chokuda i
 kotamanegi: Chokudai does.
 eulerscheZahl: now you pinged him
 elderlybeginner: this red color for timer is kind on annoying :unamused:
 Zenoscave: I have an improvement that increases my w/r against myself by about 20% with like a 1% loss rate increase. Wondering if I should resubmit
 ClosetAI: Chokudai is doing the 24h thing that he did last time I think
 eulerscheZahl: elderlybeginner it will start blinging soon
 Astrobytes: slow servers kinda ruin the last day
 eulerscheZahl: use the browser developer tools to remove it
 Zenoscave: I agree astro
 kovi: wow, iehn won topcoder marathon final
 pb4: STOP THE COUNT&#160;!!!!
 Zenoscave: no pb4. not again
 AntiSquid: :D
 Zenoscave: I can't take that anymore
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: contest the results if choku beats you :P
 eulerscheZahl: i made that joke before

 Zanoshky: pb4 congrats!
 Zanoshky: would like to hear any advice if youd like to share some?
 Zenoscave: win matches
 eulerscheZahl: git gud
 Astrobytes: lol eulerscheZahl, do you save your jokes for handy reference? :P
 struct: I tried pruning it was a fail
 struct: I go for my 2nd attempt
 AntiSquid: man what's with the snail pace submits Q_Q
 AllYourMCTS: winning is just magic
 eulerscheZahl: discord has a search bar at the top right
 Astrobytes: I knowwww
 Astrobytes: struct: Time for a Prune Array
 eulerscheZahl: but write it in paython
 AntiSquid: but but ... that would actually make sense for once&#160;!
 Zenoscave: what's a prune array?
 Astrobytes: *Payhon
 ParticleBeam: An orchard?
 Zenoscave: more ceg memes?
 Astrobytes: Ask ceg Zenoscave
 eulerscheZahl: the thing that makes GAimax faster
 Astrobytes: :D
 Zenoscave: thought so
 eulerscheZahl: astro yesterday it was paython.
 AntiSquid: what was the matrix meme Astrobytes&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you missed that i think
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, I did euler
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid&#160;?
 Astrobytes: for ceg?
 AntiSquid: in his own words
 struct: Today I felt the pain of playing vs myself
 AntiSquid: something about cost matrix&#160;?
 Zenoscave: struct what's that pain like&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Oh god, yeah
 struct: not fun
 struct: I think I failed my first attempt of pruning
 struct: But im going to try again
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: When he had the 'payoff matrix', pb4 asked him about it I believe
 Zenoscave: gl struct
 AntiSquid: pay off matrix is a real thing, just don't remember ceg's words 
 struct: Still have 12 hours
 Illedan: Nice pb4, pure luck?
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know what a payoff matrix is, but ceg had very far from a payoff matrix :D
 pb4: It'll go down, but stay in top 3
 ClosetAI: Agade is still in queue
 pb4: Normally...
 AntiSquid: it's like submits get slower by the minute .
 eulerscheZahl: but this time you can't win a starwars toaster
 Zanoshky: pb4 do you always program in c++? Do you see any benefits from other langs?
 AntiSquid: the canvas is okey
 AntiSquid: sort of
 miszu: I am using the rand() function in c++ but always give me the same value when I restart the game
 pb4: Zanoshky&#160;: don't know other languages
 NitMpez: need to srand it
 Astrobytes: srand() - call srand() if you must use rand()
 eulerscheZahl: miszu use srand(TIME(null))
 NitMpez: set your seed
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 miszu: thanks guys
 Zenoscave: too slow
 eulerscheZahl: or was it time(NULL)?
 Zenoscave: time(NULL)
 Astrobytes: srand(time(NULL))
 miszu: for MCTS what's your favorite random function?
 Zenoscave: lol
 Astrobytes: or 0
 Astrobytes: same thing
 dbf: miszu, fastrand
 eulerscheZahl: xkcd rand
 Zenoscave: time(0) == time(NULL)??? i thought they were different
 ddreams: NULL == 0
 ddreams: so
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/221/">https://xkcd.com/221/</a>very fast
 Astrobytes: I use a xorshift
 Zenoscave: oops duh
 dbf: very fast, very random
 BrunoFelthes: I only add the urgency bonus at my code now
 AntiSquid: isn't that automatically included?
 BrunoFelthes: for future turns
 struct: Well if you want to sim
 Icebox: ok I'm gonna do what I never like to do
 Astrobytes: sleep? :D
 dbf: rewrite in c++?
 Icebox: chat pls help C++ blows my mind I'm lost Q_Q
 Nerchio: personally i didn't bother implementing taxbonus for spells or urgency bonus in my simulation
 Nerchio: but maybe taxbonus could've been a little useful
 Icebox: dbf no I'm in gold with c++ already
 miszu: just read that rand() generates same randon numbers... that's not random!!!!
 struct: whats wrong Icebox?
 Zenoscave: it is. random on input. not output
 BrunoFelthes: i think that in legend any little thing can make difference
 struct: it is random
 struct: but it has default seed
 Icebox: calling q_ptr-&gt;front() on a queue crashes struct
 eulerscheZahl: i have the tax return. but don't add tax to new spells when i learn
 eulerscheZahl: and no urgency bonus either
 struct: I dont use queue sorry
 AntiSquid: check if q_ptr == NULL&#160;?!
 struct: I use plain old array as my queue
 MrSok: you should seed it with a timer
 Illedan: Is adding Learning to the search good enough as addon? :thinking:
 Icebox: neither the ptr is null nor the queue is empty AntiSquid
 Illedan: Wonder if I should try to wing adding it as a last effort 
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have that?
 Illedan: Nah
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps Illedan around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: miszu: start here<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift</a>
 Illedan: Didn't bother
 NitMpez: i don't have the depth for it
 Illedan: Ok eulerscheZahl
 Illedan: I'll do it
 Illedan: FINE
 AntiSquid: what ... i added it
 Zenoscave: do you mean learning midgame?
 NitMpez: been trying to get my depth lower to add learning
 Illedan: You had me and slaps
 AntiSquid: didn't do much i guess
 Zenoscave: or beginning
 BrunoFelthes: Illedan yes at the early turns
 eulerscheZahl: nice, random drift to top10i'll go to bed before i drop again
 Zenoscave: gn euler
 NitMpez: gl
 Illedan: Oh, BrunoFelthes. You don't do that on later turns?
 Astrobytes: gn euler, and best of luck&#160;:)
 Illedan: Intersting :thinking:
 dbf: gn euler, good submit&#160;:)
 miszu: so many different ways for randoms
 BrunoFelthes: i do, but i think that it do not do much difference
 pb4: Illedan&#160;: what does it mean "add learn to the search"&#160;?
 miszu: I mean.. I am not creating new encryption algorithm
 Zenoscave: pseduo-randoms*
 Icebox: okay antisquid it might be NULL but this doesn't make sense
 miszu: just something decent for MCTS
 miszu: yeah pseudo
 Icebox: if (q_ptr-&gt;size() &gt; 169500) {
 struct: pb4 learning psells from the tome
 eulerscheZahl: ille LEARN also helps to your your inventory and get free space for some spells
 Icebox: oh cmon
 Icebox: no pastebin
 Illedan: hmm
 NitMpez: he learns first part of the game but not after 
 dbf: miszu, what language do you use?
 miszu: c++
 BrunoFelthes: Illedan when you learn, you have more resources when new brew appear
 Astrobytes: Yeah miszu, they're good rng's
 miszu: does the random function matters that much in MCTS?
 NitMpez: also have more cases to search :P
 miszu: I just want A random move
 BrunoFelthes: so, if you have same result with learn and without learn, with learn is better at the long run
 Illedan: pb4, just using Learn as part of my simulation. Now I have it as a separate part
 Illedan: True
 dbf: miszu, after some performance tweaks you can get more sims with switch to some faster rng
 wlesavo: Astrobytes lol im trending :smiley:
 Illedan: 2 hours should be enough to add something that might work :D
 Astrobytes: dbf: that's why I linked the xorshifts
 dbf: but at the beginning just use one from standard lib
 miszu: okay thanks dbf
 miszu: I am in silver in UTTT
 Astrobytes: lol wlesavo
 struct: ahahaah
 struct: I cant believe
 struct: I dont believe thiis
 miszu: so if I want to use rand() I should call srand() followed by rand() everytime correct?
 NitMpez:&#160;?
 struct: this is my apply Aciton
 MrSok: yup
 NitMpez: no
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/41276ce2-a0b6-4c01-926a-b4efe1f670b8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/41276ce2-a0b6-4c01-926a-b4efe1f670b8</a>
 struct: anyone sees anything wrong?
 NitMpez: you should do srand once at the start of ur program
 AntiSquid: why miszu
 Astrobytes: no, once per execution miszu
 struct: this is too good
 NitMpez: srand(time(null))
 miszu: right once
 miszu: as long as it's different everytime
 NitMpez: then your rand seed will be different every time
 struct: Astrobytes check and see if you can find the bug
 MrSok: srand(time(null)) this is much better
 Icebox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0da9ac75-7050-439f-b7b6-9447efba13f6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0da9ac75-7050-439f-b7b6-9447efba13f6</a>

 Icebox: I don't understand how it can compare size of pointer
 Icebox: but can't cerr it
 Icebox: this is black magic for me I swear
 NitMpez: srand(time(NULL)) just in case since the null cap matters
 miszu: ok thanks it worked
 miszu: sorry for my noob question
 NitMpez: its ok... i've been stuck in the same spot for the last couple of days... 
 struct: So my bug was that when I brew, I didnt discount ingredients
 struct: ...
 MrSok: np everyone is making noob questions when reaching a new target
 Tyir: wait a minute, Icebox gave up on Python?
 NitMpez: yeah that will make a difference
 Icebox: I switched to C++ on saturday last week Tyir :D
 theycallmedavid: Too weak
 NitMpez: my funny thing is.... i overwrote my enemy predictions and sad thing is... i did better with my garbarge enemy preduction than i do with my actual one
 Tyir: you've betrayed all my expectations, before it was pure heuristics, then you gave up on that. now you gave up on Python
 wlesavo: struct so you brewed by pure magic, no ingridients involved?
 Astrobytes: sorry struct, just looked. You didn't take off the cost from your inventory?
 struct: yes
 struct: I didnt
 AntiSquid: (void *)ptr Icebox maybe&#160;?
 struct: and got me to gold :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: new strat
 AntiSquid: cerr &lt;&lt; (void *)ptr &lt;&lt; 
 NitMpez: gratz
 Astrobytes: Having similar issues fixing my bugs
 wlesavo: easy gold 
 struct: Time to see now if this was a feature
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: You'll find out in 2-3 hours :P
 AntiSquid: not sure if &amp;ptr works either
 wlesavo: skipping ingridients when learning with near full inventory was a fun one
 AntiSquid: woah barely top 100 silver .
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 pass me a bucket of motivation
 Automaton2000: yeah, i've seen that one
 Astrobytes: I wish I'd had the motivation earlier in the week. Ah well. Contests always a fun time anyway
 wlesavo: Astrobytes did you liked the game after all?
 AntiSquid: would have preferred this as pure optimization contest of sorts instead of the tiny extra bits here and there 
 Astrobytes: Yeahhh up to a point wlesavo, it's not my favourite, but it's alright
 BrunoFelthes: if you cast the 4 t0 spell, with only 3 free spaces, the movement is invalid, or you can have 3 t0?
 AllYourMCTS: invalid
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: if total exceeds 10 it's invalid
 Zanoshky: how do  you guys predict enemy movements? I use java and barely do 7 node depth search with timeouts
 AntiSquid: stick to 20ms Zanoshky
 AntiSquid: and prune massively
 BrunoFelthes: i predict only 5 enemy turns...
 Zanoshky: how to enfroce prune?
 Astrobytes: if (tooBig) prune;
 miszu: when you create new object in c++, does int members have value 0 or garbage value?
 Astrobytes: (sorry, just joking&#160;:) )
 Zanoshky: A prune is a dried plum of any cultivar, mostly the European plum. :D
 AntiSquid: just leave at -1 what you can't predict&#160;: distances 0: 5 3 2 5 3distances 1: 1 2 -1 -1 1 
 Astrobytes: depends if you initialise them or not miszu
 miszu: the default constructor
 miszu: I have no constructor in my structs
 AntiSquid: can have garbage value, depends
 Zanoshky: do you also take into consideration learning a spell which might be used down the tree branch?
 Zanoshky: because i always timeout if i include learning
 Astrobytes: You can either make a constructor to init to 0, set them to 0 as default or zero them when you need them - depends on usage
 miszu: yeah so if you simply declare member int with no initial value, it will take garbage value when you create an object
 Zanoshky: does anyone uses a star in this contest?
 Astrobytes: Undefined, it might, it might not
 AntiSquid: hard to ask 7k participants that question :P
 theycallmedavid: I try to build death star
 miszu: Members of class types have no default values in general case. In order to for a class member to get a deterministic value it has to be initialized
 miszu: that answers my question
 Astrobytes: Wait for PMs Zanoshky
 LordSkaven: so my optimized BFS and A* bots are still being beaten by my own weird search bot that I wrote on Tuesday and has no optimizations FML
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/509283176">https://www.codingame.com/replay/509283176</a>
 Astrobytes: miszu, if this is regarding MCTS nodes be careful with initialisation as it can be costly
 struct: So many at the same time
 struct: Almost everyone in legend submiting
 struct: except 1
 miszu: Astrobytes, ok yeah thanks for the headsup. I am aiming for correctness for now
 mojojojo: are the submits still slow?
 AntiSquid: paint drying speed
 Astrobytes: Be prepared to throw everything at optimisation miszu, correctness be damned :P

 Icebox: this output
 Icebox: so literally after calling the function again
 Icebox: the the pointer go to shambles
 Icebox: does*
 Icebox: absolutely nothing happens inbetween
 wlesavo: Astrobytes lol that totally desribes my overflowating hash function
 AntiSquid: isn't q_ptr supposed to give same result there if nothing happens in between&#160;?
 Icebox: it does
 AntiSquid: do you use new when you create objects&#160;?
 Icebox: I use Emplace
 Icebox: which creates the object in the queue directly
 Icebox: I assue no new needed there
 miszu: Astrobytes is optimization important to reach gold? :O
 struct: for uttt?
 struct: no
 Icebox: I meant absolutely nothing happens between cerr U and cerr S
 Icebox: and U still cerrs a valid pointer address
 miszu: struct, what about legendary?
 struct: yes
 Icebox: while calling the function again cerrs nothing and crashes
 miszu: do you incorporate some game knowledge it too? Like first few moves?
 struct: my uttt is vanilla mcts
 Icebox: I'm completely dumbfounded and don't even know how to debug this
 Icebox: Q_Q
 miszu: oh I see

 ZarthaxX: what's happening ice?
 SirLoxley: still can't beat that silver boss&#160;:/sometimes I do, but not consistently
 Astrobytes: Pointer problems Zartho
 ZarthaxX: if you are experiencing some extrain bug, you are probably smashing the stack
 ZarthaxX: strange*
 ZarthaxX: mmm okey Astro
 Astrobytes: Well, I think so
 Astrobytes: Just had a quick look, don't trust me
 Astrobytes: trying to be higher in silver
 AntiSquid: feeling like gold or delete Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: yeah, tell me about it
 Icebox: ZarthaxX you might be onto something
 Icebox: oh my god you might be onto something
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 understands me! 
 Automaton2000: so, back to the code?
 miszu: does Automaton2000 throw random txt or it actually reads input?
 Icebox: what is the stack size?
 Automaton2000: do you get a lot of time to get back to your old code
 Icebox: ZarthaxX&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: i meant that you might be hitting the return address of a function
 ZarthaxX: or some other variable in the stack
 ZarthaxX: like a ptr for example if thats the case
 Icebox: nonoono what is the stack size?
 ZarthaxX: struct asked
 Astrobytes: 8 mb
 Astrobytes: westicles checked the other day with ulimit
 Astrobytes: @Icebox
 ZarthaxX: why the @
 Icebox: AaAaaaaaa
 Icebox: yup

 Astrobytes: just to show who I was talking to ZarthaxX. Meh, so judgemental :P
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Q12: If I am in rank 48 (Silver) should I risk a submit that will maybe help me a little?
 AntiSquid: bedtime now, maybe by tomorrow someone kicks me to gold&#160;:'(
 AllYourMCTS: whats your goal?
 Astrobytes: how many hours you got Q12? :D
 Q12: gold league
 AllYourMCTS: well you aint getting gold league by not submitting!
 Icebox: ZarthaxX give me your address
 Icebox: I'll order you pizza
 Icebox:&#160;:)
 Q12: Astrobytes: one
 AntiSquid: if it's not top 20 you aren't really risking anything (prizes) Q12
 Astrobytes: the submit might take longer than that Q12
 Q12: so I should submit...
 AntiSquid: 2 hours for my last submit
 AntiSquid: listen to the heart of the bots Q12
 Q12: I am trying, but he doesn't listen to me :rage: :joy:
 Q12: Ok, lets do it!!!!
 ZarthaxX: Icebox what?
 ZarthaxX: did you manage to fix it?
 ZarthaxX: i want a pineapple one&#160;:)
 Icebox: I didn't yet, but it makes too much sense
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX you monster
 ZarthaxX: ah, okey
 Icebox: I use around 9mb of data
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes i just said it so someone commented that lol
 Zenoscave: blow the stack&#160;!!!!!
 Astrobytes: Thought so tbh :D
 ZarthaxX: blow it baby
 Icebox: and it might or might not be chilling on the stack
 Icebox: so yeah
 Astrobytes: recursion Icebox?
 Icebox: if this fixes
 Icebox: yeah
 Icebox: recursion
 Zenoscave: def a stack blow
 Icebox: so if this fixes you can pm me your address ZarthaxX
 Icebox: I'll order you a pineapple  one&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: and mine, I could well go a pizza :P
 Astrobytes: sorry, talking Scottish: I could destroy a pizza
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: okey
 Astrobytes: Welp, given submit times I don't think I can do much more. Hopefully this one stays top half of silver and I'm cool;
 Astrobytes: or cool.
 cblte: Hi Guys. 
 cblte: Just started and getting back into the game of programming&#160;:) this time learning some Go and Python
 Astrobytes: When you subsitute . with&#160;;&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: there are 11 hours and 19 mins to submit in the current contest cblte :D
 Icebox: yup that fixed it ZarthaxX
 Icebox: making it tail recursive fixed the issue
 Icebox: \o/

 Astrobytes: gj Icebox
 ZarthaxX: nice :O
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes you are gonna hate eating each piece :D

 miszu: given an int that represent a bit like 64, how to get which position is the bit?
 miszu: 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 4 = 3rd...
 miszu: wrost case I'll use a counter in my loop and get the position like that
 Astrobytes: fast way? __builtin_ctzll

 Lysk: this one maybe <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/builtin-functions-gcc-compiler/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/builtin-functions-gcc-compiler/</a>?
 miszu: ah thanks
 miszu: I guess loops would come to the same thing
 miszu: I am using a while loop anyways
 Astrobytes: yeah 'bit' better Lysk, thx&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: this will be fast
 BrunoFelthes: pb4 with more than 2 point than the 2nd place...
 Lysk: I can shorten my loops to avoid going through trailing zeros :thinking:
 Lysk: from french channel, he has precomputed path to each potion
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I heard earlier
 Astrobytes: It's working really well
 Astrobytes: PM's are gonna be interesting 
 Lysk: yup, i would like to learn how is the stater representation used
 Andy176822: anyone know a good way to know how close the opponent is to getting the 6th brew?
 Andy176822: I might be missing something
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/509320386">https://www.codingame.com/replay/509320386</a>
 struct: :D
 The_Duck: like, how to know how many brews they've already done?
 elderlybeginner: servers seems to be red hot
 Andy176822: yea
 Andy176822: that doesn't seem to be provided in the input
 The_Duck: it's not, but you can check each turn to see if your opponent's score changed
 The_Duck: if it did, then they brewed something
 Andy176822: aha, good idea
 Andy176822: thanks
 Astrobytes: lol struct
 Astrobytes: oh hi The_Duck, nice to see you back again&#160;:)
 Nerchio: pb4 29 points 2.2points ahead atm :o
 Nerchio: BrunoFelthes nice result in java too&#160;:)
 BrunoFelthes: :D
 BrunoFelthes: Heuristics &gt; Performance :D
 Nerchio: interesting ^^
 BrunoFelthes: I changed some things that was not very good at my code, and the number of visited nodes jumped from 10k to 20k :D
 Nerchio: i can do more but still much worse
 Nerchio: but i won't be changing my code anymore :D
 BrunoFelthes: I'm not confident that this code will get the top20
 Nerchio: hehe i will be cheering for java player good luck
 BrunoFelthes: im sure that it is possible to write a top1 code in java...  the best players just dont like to use it... and CG platform do not have a good experience to play with GC languages
 Rikerslash: a question to the java developers. Do you use soem unusual datastructures to get performance. I use mainly ArrayList and Hashmaps and a lot of custom objects. Any tips?
 Rikerslash: I am 10th with java atm
 wlesavo: the real question is it possible to write top1 python code
 BrunoFelthes: plain arrays
 ThomasNicoullaud: pb4 you timeout
 Rikerslash: arrays instead of lists if possible if sized are fixed?
 Rikerslash: sizes
 Nerchio: well just try to avoid creating many new objects every round, if you can create them on round 1 and only refresh their state in future rounds
 Nerchio: its much better
 BrunoFelthes: reuse as much as possible the objects
 Rikerslash: this is a very good idea thanks
 Nerchio: yes this is the first contest where i really needed to do this
 Nerchio: but basically you don't really want really big garbage collections since they can time you out sometimes
 Rikerslash: at the moment for example I put all my spells and tomes and stuff in lists at the start
 Rikerslash: every turn
 Nerchio: if you create arraylists or whatever make sure they don't auto-resize during your work that can really kill performance
 Nerchio: ah I also do this it's not enough object to bother with in my opinion
 Nerchio: we're talking here the big things like search or whatever where you use thousands of objects mostly
 Nerchio: ideally you don't want to use objects and use plain types
 meh1001: I just profiled my code for the first time, and found that 16% of my time is spent by my function that determines if I have the ingredients to cast a spell
 meh1001: :expressionless:
 Nerchio: you run local instance to profile it?
 meh1001: yeah
 Nerchio: kk i rarely do that so can't use profiling&#160;:(
 meh1001: I scraped input from a match and shoved it in locally
 meh1001: overrode input() to just read it from a file
 Nerchio: so you need to print the input to stderr then
 Nerchio:&#160;?
 Nerchio: and you just copy 
 Nerchio: will try it next contest for easy debugging
 Beresta: yea I did the same
 meh1001: yeah I just made it WAIT 100 times, so the input is not useful for determining how smart the bot is, but made it possible to do the profile
 meh1001: wish I'd though of doing it last week when I still had energy to try and improve it
 Nerchio: isn't it just 1 turn though?
 meh1001: nope, cause while my side sends WAIT the enemy side is still learning an brewing so the spells and potions still changed some
 Beresta: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/079e4dee-7a9f-4fbe-9185-a4c65c13db67">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/079e4dee-7a9f-4fbe-9185-a4c65c13db67</a>
 Beresta: oh wow didn't know it works like that :D &gt; as for profiling, I just print every turn, something like that
 Nerchio: well i mean i use timers inside the code as well but would like to profile in the IDE 
 meh1001: Well, I can't say it's a great idea... but I'm using python and am also very lazy so I wanted to use the python profiler
 Beresta: well profiling is kinda dangerous and could easily be misleadingin debug mode its just completely different from release, and in release its not that reliable
 Nerchio: :grimacing:
 Beresta: might be helpful early to local some real bottlenecks, but later meh
 meh1001: I certainly don't know the ins and outs of it
 meh1001: yeah like, 18% of my time is calculating my heuristics which honestly are of questionable usefulness
 Beresta: yea, I once added some terrible check to evaluation and it resuced my iterations like 10x :D 
 Beresta: reduced*
 meh1001: 17% checking inventory against spell cost  though is pretty ridiculous
 Nerchio: the more stuff i added to evaluation it slowed down as well
 Nerchio: even if it was if checks
 Nerchio: but every thing counts i guess
 Beresta: meh1001 precalculate it all
 meh1001: I certainly learned lots of stuff doing this challenge that I didn't know before about optimization. Yeah that's one of em
 meh1001: sadly I doubt I'll ever use any of this knowledge in my actual job snicker but it's super fun
 Astrobytes: Fun is the general idea&#160;;)
 Beresta: yea, true
 Beresta: I'm waiting for it to finish now so I can look what others did on forums, I wonder what were my biggest mistakes :D
 geppoz: meh1001 if you want to reduce that time, you can build a lookup table precalculated
 geppoz: an array of 1001 elements, where index maps all inventory combination,
 geppoz: and element is an array of possibile recipes (42) with possible/nopossibile and remainder
 geppoz: and remainder itself is the index where you land after cast that spell
 meh1001: thats an excellent idea
 geppoz: I didn't do it, since it is not my issue :D
 Zenoscave: if you do an array of 82. you can also include the first for spells and all 36 potions. and have a lookup of cast and brew
 meh1001: it would probably get me 20% reduction in time honestly, well, assuming the lookups are much faster (which they would have to bE) than the list comprehension things I'm currently doing
 Njitram: Whats with the guy in legend that always times out at turn 1?
 geppoz: a smurf deleted
 SkyCoops: Coucou les amis
 geppoz: salut
 geppoz: (?)
 Astrobytes: coucou SkyCoops #fr
 MuddySneakers: Does anybody know: does threading help, or do you only actually get a single core?
 Astrobytes: Single unfortunately
 Astrobytes: multi-core arch but we only get 1
 SinOfWrath: Gold submission: won two against top100 players, lost one against a lower ranked player: let me place you at rank 300. This is gonna be a long night to wait my rank stabilize. :D
 Astrobytes: there are submissions still running (in Legend at least) from around 20:00 (GMT)
 Astrobytes: and hello fellow Scottish person SinOfWrath
 SinOfWrath: hi Astrobytes, good to know that it's super slow tonight
 SinOfWrath: I guess 7000+ game on last night is not so unexpected
 Astrobytes: Yeah, last night of the contest but this is actually the highest number of contestants who submitted if I'm not mistaken
 miszu: curious, how much $ does it take to run montly the platform?
 Astrobytes: No idea. You'd have to ask Thibaud
 Astrobytes: They do have a main business other than this
 miszu: debugging my UTTT, my game engine has hidden errors
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/">https://www.codingame.com/work/</a>
 miszu: I find this platform more fun than hackerrank or other stuff
 Astrobytes: the link I posted is how they make $ or € rather
 AbundantPuddle: Did they combine the urgency  bonus into the price by default?
 Astrobytes: Right, not going any further so will stick with my crappy silver rank. GL to the remaining tryharders :D
 Astrobytes: AbundantPuddle: price the amount of rupees this will win you if this is a potion recipe, 0 otherwise. This includes the urgency bonus.
 Astrobytes: The urgency bonus is also in tomeIndex: This is also the value of the urgency bonus if this is a potion recipe.
 AbundantPuddle: Yes, I restarted my code in Python and it didn't specify that. My earlier code I could have sworn you had to add the tome_index to the price to get the overall profit.
 AbundantPuddle: But thank you, I'm just glad somebody could clarify that for me. I appreciate that.
 AbundantPuddle: They changed how the default python code reads in the variables as well . Just wanted to make sure I didn't miss something.
 AbundantPuddle: Oops, I apologize. I did just read that in the Game Protocol.
 Astrobytes: :D 
 Astrobytes: goodnight/day all
 ZarthaxX: astrooooo
 ZarthaxX: nooooooooooooooooooooo
 AbundantPuddle: Have a good night Astro. Take care.
 Astrobytes: zarthooooooooooo
 ZarthaxX: you cant leave me like that
 ZarthaxX: wait for my submit to end(?
 Astrobytes: I have to, I've been MadKnighted
 ZarthaxX: okey lol
 ZarthaxX: gn astro
 Astrobytes: You're way above me anyway
 Astrobytes: But still, silver fistbump
 Astrobytes: If you get gold I'll buy you a pineapple ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: i think gold is secured
 ZarthaxX: :fist:
 ZarthaxX: gimme pineapple
 particleflux: when bfs is optimized too much and now it actually gets worse 'cause it looks too much into the future with bad scoring :S
 ZarthaxX: limit the depth
 Astrobytes: looks that way :fist: :pineapple: 
 NinjaDoggy: lol unlucky
 NinjaDoggy: astro heading out?
 Astrobytes: yeah, top 50% silver 
 NinjaDoggy: alrighty, gn m8
 Astrobytes: or I was at least
 ZarthaxX: have a good one byto
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:*
 Astrobytes: gn NinjaDoggy&#160;:) all the best luck to the late submitters!
 struct: nn
 ClockSort: see ya
 NinjaDoggy: hey clock!
 NinjaDoggy: u staying till end?
 ClockSort: trying to
 ClockSort: i keep adding LEARN to my search in different ways that all make the results worse
 NitMpez: i'm the opposite i'm trying different ways to prune to get pass depth 8th and having no luck
 NinjaDoggy: silly trick that sped up my performance a lot in C++:
 NinjaDoggy: memset all your global arrays to 0 on turn 1
 NinjaDoggy: that way it forces them to be loaded in memory
 NinjaDoggy: and then it's much faster to access after that
 miszu: ok I think my game engine for UTTT is bug free. I can run couple runs with no errors
 miszu: I had a previous submission for UTT in silver and finished 5th. I totally rewrote my bot and just playing random moves. He was able to draw with the boss  bot. How sad was my previous submission couldn't draw even with sloppy MCTS
 Michael_Howard: I know how this must sound... but has the Silver boss got harder to gatekeep Gold? :sweat:
 Michael_Howard: Talking about in IDE, not even arena.
 Lysk: NinjaDoggy is  it 8*sizeof() or just sizeoff in the memset?
 Zenoscave: Nah, they don't change bots 
 SirLoxley: I cant beat him consistently either. Sometimes ... rarely I do
 Michael_Howard: I went back to my pre-tree version to test it &amp; it got absolutely minced
 Michael_Howard: At least I know my 10 node tree is doing something lol
 SirLoxley: my endgame sucks, didn't read properly "tier1 or higher"
 NinjaDoggy: @lysk just sizeof
 Lysk: gotcha thanks
 ClockSort: mizsu what is UTTT?
 NinjaDoggy: ultimate tic tac toe
 ClockSort: :thumbsup:
 miszu: question, what functions you guys use to measure time
 ClockSort: i use Stopwatch class   (C#, sorry :D)
 miszu: haha :P
 cegprakash: I just added simulation and it's tooo bad any tips
 cegprakash: I've 90K sims at depth 5 clearly something is wrong with my moves
 cegprakash: I'm last in silver :D
 miszu: make sure you are returning the best move and not the worst move
 struct: Dont discount ingredients when you brew
 ClockSort: eliminate identical positions from your tree
 MadKnight: where are the static lists in the referee&#160;?
 MadKnight: of spells and recipes
 ClockSort: lol this match <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/509440481">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/509440481</a>
 ClockSort: best debug output ever
 Zenoscave: lol He used to do it one word at a time
 MadKnight: i can't find the list of all recipes/spells
 MadKnight: Zenoscave maybe u got it&#160;?
 geppoz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java</a>
 MadKnight: oh thk
 geppoz: yw
 Zenoscave: sorry thought you said "why" not "where"
 Zenoscave: misread
 MadKnight: does it use the index in this array for the id of spell in the tome&#160;?
 Zenoscave: I believe so
 NinjaDoggy: it's... complicated ish
 MadKnight: can i do allSpells[tome.spells[3].id]&#160;?
 Ridakz: when u learn a new spell the id changes
 NinjaDoggy: learns are id'ed properly
 Ridakz: so u have to track new id
 MadKnight: yea i know it changes when u learn
 NinjaDoggy: brews are index + offset(42 i think)
 MadKnight: i only need the tome id for now
 NinjaDoggy: yea learn id is the index
 Michael_Howard: Is the leaderboard getting faster again? 50% in half an hour.
 Michael_Howard: Sleepy Europeans.
 ClockSort: maybe so.
 ClockSort: stupid question: how do you count the number of potions the opponent has brewed?
 SirLoxley: every time his score changed ... ++
 ClockSort: brilliant. i was trying to watch potions while factoring in any potions i took. :O
 SirLoxley: so close ... in IDE I lose to silver boss and it's always by a point or two
 cegprakash: score tracking I think @SirLoxley
 hcabel: Someone find a good way to know witch spells learn&#160;?? I try lot of things but the best result was learn first spell all the time ^^
 SirLoxley: there are certain spells that work well together. I pick them that way. Plus that (4 0 0 0) and (3 0 0 0) are must have
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hcabel there are 14 learns my bot will never do, that's the simplest way to start
 Michael_Howard: @hcabel you can give them a score based on tier value, then add+subtract tax bonus/penalties.
 pedrosorio: that awkward moment when the challenge is almost over and you're looking for ideas on how to rank spells (because you just learn the first thing every time), and everyone responding is way below you on the leaderboard... 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lvl and rank may be a better indicator pedrosorio
 Counterbalance: what I do is I pretend I know all the spells, then find the brews, and see which ones I used
 pedrosorio: PatrickMcGinnisII&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^ I only pretend I know 1 at a time, the learn that has the most cross usage is what i pick
 meh1001: What I did was include spells 1 at a time in my search and if they shaved more than 2 off the distance I'd learn em, but it was too expensive so yeah 
 meh1001: but since I had horribly unoptimized python I didn't have the nodes to not time out most of the time xD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: because i use php i have a trimmed down sim, and it's not even perfect
 ddreams: I had a MCTS for learning the spells, but after seeing recurse jump to the top by simply picking the first 8 I stopped thinking about it
 miszu: c++ question. I have problem declaring my node class. Something to do with incomplete type:
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e75c4b7c-6d3f-4804-9115-57e699a77c8e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e75c4b7c-6d3f-4804-9115-57e699a77c8e</a>
 Counterbalance: if it's Node:struct Node;struct Node {....}
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Node *
 SirLoxley: yeah you have to predeclare it
 SirLoxley: the compiler doesn't know what a Node is when he sees that vector&lt;node&gt;
 miszu: same problem
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/acbbe1b8-4a1f-4775-826b-5266defa2eb7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/acbbe1b8-4a1f-4775-826b-5266defa2eb7</a>
 Zenoscave: If I increase my beam width my search becomes lessaccurate...
 Zenoscave: not because of time 
 ddreams: need a pointer, not the class itself
 SirLoxley: make that a vector&lt;Node *&gt;
 ddreams: use vector&lt;Node *&gt;
 Counterbalance: which type can't it find?
 miszu: the parent
 miszu: I need a pointer?
 Zenoscave: struct Node parent; no?
 SirLoxley: yes. The compiler doesn't know how big a node is before the thing isn't fully constructed
 miszu: yeah makes sense
 Zenoscave: ^ that too
 miszu: ok it works
 miszu: thanks all
 miszu: my road to c++ and MCTS has lots of mountains
 SirLoxley: good luck. I think I give up here.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Battles in progress 97%
 miszu: oh it's for tic tac toe
 SirLoxley: Is it possible to continue on the bot after the competition?
 primitive_coding: @miszu if you put a node into a node, that node in the node would have to contain  a node, which would have to contain a node, too, because ist's a node...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: prolly end up a multi in a bit
 SirLoxley: I am a bit upset that I didn't make it to Gold
 miszu: primitive_coding yeah I was thinking about the same. It would be a recursion
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i tried, but just trying to stay in top 1k was a challenge in itself
 miszu: i'm trying to do MCTS but it's very easy to make a mistake
 miszu: in the logic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap, dropped to 1001st
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh well, dinnertime glhf
 MadKnight: tome.add(new TomeSpell(new Recipe(-3, 0, 0, 1)));wait how do i tell if it's repeatable&#160;?
 ddreams: if any are negative, it's repeatable
 Batpapa: yes
 cegprakash: should I go for the smallest rupees one or the highest rupees one?
 MadKnight: rly? repeatable if any negative&#160;?
 ddreams: what do you think?
 ddreams: did I stutter?
 Batpapa: miszu, I first made MCTS, that was a huge lose of time (for me at least)
 miszu: I am doing the tic tac toe bot, not the contest
 MadKnight: can't i be confused and ask again?
 miszu: I gave up on contest haha. I am happy with silver
 Batpapa: repeatable = !anyNegative
 Batpapa: oh ok ahah
 Lysk: except initial spells
 Lysk: if 0 &lt;= id &lt; 42 and a negative then repeatable
 ddreams: you can ask more questions if you're confused, but just repeating the answer with a question mark behind is pointless
 Icebox: MadKnight fix your bot
 Icebox: gold when?
 MadKnight: doing the engine now
 Lysk: you should stream MadKnight!
 MadKnight: i'm just learning to speak english cmon
 miszu: why people are pushing to stream? :P
 geppoz: you are really starting to play at 8h to end? :D
 MadKnight: no i'd use an alt for a stream
 Tyir: Icebox, give me some pointers on how to do this better
 Icebox: I don't know if I'm a position to give pointers :D
 BrunoFelthes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/509504721">https://www.codingame.com/replay/509504721</a>
 Icebox: I just made a weird improvement that might not be an improvement
 BrunoFelthes: 26 turns against 1st position
 BrunoFelthes: not bad :D
 Tyir: you are working on C++ now, i figured you have tons of pointers
 cegprakash: 74 turns againt #1000 and still lost
 cegprakash: not bad
 ddreams: BrunoFelthes what strategy are you using?
 BrunoFelthes: same as everyone...
 BrunoFelthes: chokudai
 Icebox: where are you Tyir
 NinjaDoggy: can anyone give some tips/helpers for uploading hardcoded data onto codingame?
 Tyir: overall ~1300 with some brute force 3-4 depth
 Icebox: that's silver?
 NinjaDoggy: say, if I wanted to upload an array of integers how could I compactly do that?
 Lysk: I have python scripts to put stuff into a single file
 NinjaDoggy: i'm talking about hard coding an array of size a few thousand
 The_Duck: maybe you could encode it in a string literal, that gets you one code byte per actual byte of data
 Tyir: i should also state that i forced it into my code, it doesn't take into account learning
 NinjaDoggy: The_Duck, yes that's what i'm trying to do but
 Tyir: my simulations don't look at spells to learn; so definitely not ideal
 NinjaDoggy: there's apparently some fancy stuff u can do with characters that contain more than 1 byte of info
 Zenoscave: wanna know how ninja
 The_Duck: would that be better? does the submission size limit care about characters, or bytes?
 NinjaDoggy: yes please Zenoscave&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Characters
 NinjaDoggy: yea it just counts 100k
 The_Duck: huh
 Zenoscave: unicode
 NinjaDoggy: yea weird
 NinjaDoggy: um... unicode is nice and all but...
 Icebox: that is not true tho
 Icebox: there is a filesize limit not char size limit
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;? didn't someone post a pie compression thing
 Zenoscave: what's the filesize limit?
 Icebox: so more bytes per char is just less chars
 Icebox: 100kb
 Zenoscave: I thought it mattered or is that just shortest
 NinjaDoggy: actually 1 byte per character is enough for now i guess...
 Icebox: I mean that's really easy to test...
 NinjaDoggy: a factor of 4 or 8 won't really impact much
 Icebox: just upload 100kb file with normal chars
 Icebox: and 110kb file with unicode
 Zenoscave: dd time

 ddreams: code a bot friend
 Rodrigo_the_coder: how
 emh: ohh I got to Gold actually
 emh: with my last submit before I went to bed hehe
 cegprakash: what is silver to gold strat?
 cegprakash: go for fastest potions?
 jrke: ceg i think yes that would work
 ddreams: I'm pretty sure that's not enough
 ddreams: though I could be wrong
 mlemm: you need a good depth sim
 linjoehan: Dont think so either. Fast ones might get to little gold.
 AbundantPuddle: Is that like "Code a bot, friend" or "Code a bot-friend?"
 KrabbyFR: that's my first challenge :D do you have any ressources where I can learn to do sim?
 ddreams: both work
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 linjoehan: I did have a try at fastest first but it was quite bad, maybe I'm the problem though.
 mlemm: im simulating fastest/highest brews and still couldnt climb to gold
 mlemm: because my depth is too low
 rockstar555: hii Good morning guys
 Whiskee: because silver is a very different place now
 emh: cegprakash I'm doing beam search with brew price / turns
 emh: so average gain per turn
 Whiskee: I was very high before the cutoff but had a bugged version when it happened so didn't make it
 linjoehan: my depth is to low too, I just had an eval for incomplete ones, but that may be the problem mlemm
 cegprakash: I don't do BFS yet&#160;:(
 cegprakash: only simu
 therealbeef: made Gold :D
 MadKnight: why so cegprakash&#160;?
 MadKnight: and how do u use simu&#160;?
 linjoehan: Will MCTS work on this thing? or am I just going to hate myself for trying later

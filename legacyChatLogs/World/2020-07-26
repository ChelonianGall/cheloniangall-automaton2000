 rahulsain3000: ok so i shouldnt back out and solve those easy puzzles first
 jacek: good morning
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 jacek: AutomatonNN do your job
 AutomatonNN: how do you know that the boss will be a wood league the match?
 PhantomPencilCase_2d77: hello
 coll_ect: 1
 O-pera: Do I have to check messages not separate in codingame.com/ide/puzzle/chuck-norris&#160;?
 O-pera: or merge it
 O-pera: or *separate it
 AntiSquid: happy caturday
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: if it solved your code
 mark7: hello
 aCat: What is the CoC quest after 'reach top 1000'?
 jacek: win 3 games in a row
 aCat: hmm, hope I did this in teh past&#160;;-)
 aCat: Dzięki&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like aCat and me were blocked at the same step when the quest map appeared
 aCat: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i even had 3 languages before
 aCat: I've been also heavily blocked by MarsLander - which I plan to start from years
 eulerscheZahl: that was no problem for me. but don't panic with 200 chars
 aCat: I didn't - probably only Lua and Python, I had to do some stuff in c#
 aCat: this one I didn't even reveal
 jacek: whats after solve puzzle of the week?
 eulerscheZahl: for me probably C#, Python and Ruby, i don't remember
 aCat: haha no idea jacek :D
 eulerscheZahl: 30 achievements
 eulerscheZahl: 2 hard
 eulerscheZahl: lvl20
 aCat: lol, easy
 eulerscheZahl: 2 very hard
 eulerscheZahl: 100 achievements
 jacek: so just wait a week for more sane puzzle of the week
 dbdr: the current one is interesting
 eulerscheZahl: agreed
 MSmits: is it still the wifi one?
 MSmits: when are they updated?
 DomiKo: i  guess still the wifi one
 hydraaaaa: how do i find out what language these guys are gonna add next?
 darkhorse64: don't panic in 200 chars for code golf&#160;? Much too long for a one liner
 Washier: i suck at code gold
 Washier: *golf
 Washier: much rather obsess about some 2 player board game (hint-hint)
 darkhorse64: My recipe for golfing: solve the puzzle, look for published solutions, google "golf tips for target language", do a pass every couple of months. Solving in different languages helps too 
 Washier: sounds like a good recipe. if dipped my toes into ruby like that, and enjoyed it. 
 Washier: but obsesses with the 2 player board games for now, and some while. wish we had more players though(must be patient i guess)
 Washier: *obsessed
 Insufficient: Any of you guys ever got this?&#160;: 'OupsAn error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".'
 mark7:  B o            o E
 mark7: how is minimum communication distance is 1.00 here?
 mark7: and what is is to connect A-C?
 jacek: Insufficient youre clash addict
 DomiKo: mark7 use satellite transmitters in C and D
 Insufficient: no i get it when playing testcases in puzzles and things sometimes - i dont really play clash of code
 mark7: DomiKo what is communication distance? 
 mark7: how is distance between B-E 1.00?
 mark7: maybe i didnt understood the question properly
 DomiKo: only calculate that between direct links
 DomiKo: so only BA AC CD DE
 darkhorse64: 83 for don't panic/ruby
 darkhorse64: it makes real golfers laughing
 Washier: Console.WriteLine...and i've lost already
 mark7: okay satellite has distance 0, all other are already one unit apart
 mark7: Washier coc provides template though
 mark7: DomiKo thanks
 DomiKo: mark7 no problem
 DomiKo: code golf quests are after mars lander?
 MSmits: who needs advice on puzzle of the week?
 eulerscheZahl: Automaton does
 MSmits: AutomatonNN do you need advice on puzzle of the week?
 AutomatonNN: ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 eulerscheZahl: hahaha
 MSmits: uh oh
 MSmits: so it's finally doing what you want instead of stalking you eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: but atm i don't care about it. where is my struct?
 darkhorse64: MSmits perverting innocent chat bots
 MSmits: hey it's not me, it's Euler
 MSmits: i don't influence it at all
 eulerscheZahl: i even filed a PR while doing what's struct's part of our game <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/pull/32">https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/pull/32</a>
 MSmits: what game?
 eulerscheZahl: secret game
 MSmits: oh that one
 Washier: if its 2 player perfect info board game i promise i will obsess about it
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: maybe it's chess
 Washier: ooh
 eulerscheZahl: it's not!
 Washier: phew!
 eulerscheZahl: enough said
 MSmits: would you tell us if it was?
 eulerscheZahl: if you volunteer to test the game and not tell anyone, i might show it to you
 Washier: he would i guess. chess is a touchy thing around here imho
 darkhorse64: illedan has an empty github repo about chess
 MSmits: mmh
 eulerscheZahl: that's him at its finest :D
 MSmits: is it complicated to create a sim for this game?
 eulerscheZahl: i won't comment on this
 MSmits: if not, i'll test it
 Washier: fishing
 darkhorse64: Are there collisions&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: :mouth_zipper:
 jacek: is there fog of war?
 Washier: hehe
 MSmits: :zipper_mouth:
 darkhorse64: and rps&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: thanks
 Washier: its not the contest is it. noob doesnt know
 jacek: does this game make people go crazy?
 Washier: already has
 eulerscheZahl: it might become a contest. thibaud didn't exclude the possibility
 darkhorse64: does this game make MSmits crazy&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: which is why i won't share anything here
 Washier: already is
 Washier:&#160;:)
 MSmits: I'm working on othello, oware and yavalath currently. Don't need another game I think
 eulerscheZahl: no UTTT?
 MSmits: nah not for now, maybe in the future 
 Washier: beat you today in othello. fluke, might want to check if bug? my bot cowers
 eulerscheZahl: yinsh didn't get any popular, did it?
 MSmits: hmm nah, my leaderboard version is outdated
 MSmits: got a far better one in the works
 MSmits: wins 100% vs renard and averages 30-40% against rest
 MSmits: top 4 i mean
 eulerscheZahl: with an opening book or with real gameplay?
 MSmits: real gameplay
 MSmits: it will still end 5th i think, but it will pull down dbd r hard while getting there, maybe i'll get 4th because of the rating bonuses from doing that
 dbdr: with a real AI?
 MSmits: he'll still be 1
 MSmits: yes dbd r just with my 8 params fitted
 MSmits: that's all i did
 dbdr: you're avoiding pinging me while replying to me? :D
 MSmits: yeah i just realized that
 MSmits: habit
 <b>**dbdr needs to check the logs now, if it's a habbit</b></p><p><img src="/a/43448306132121" /> dbdr: I was refering to the "real AIs don't use search" forum post
 MSmits: just search for dbd r
 MSmits: ohh
 dbdr: exactly
 MSmits: that one
 MSmits: ridiculous post
 dbdr: find all the secret things you said about me
 MSmits: yeah I am curious myself, i dont remember half of what i said 
 dbdr: 14 days with hits
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: so i talked about you for 14 days?
 mark7: link to chess coding contest?
 MSmits: there isn't one I think&#160;?
 caubeloatchoat24: hey! i want to switch from win to ubuntu, but i still dont find any particularly about. Can anyone tell me. Plzzz
 MSmits: you're looking for ubuntu?
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ubuntu.com/">https://ubuntu.com/</a>
 dbdr: not just you MSmits
 MSmits: ahh yes other people talk about you too
 MSmits: filter those out, seems far less interesting
 dbdr: surely&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: but we don't avoid the ping while dbdr being here
 MSmits: makes sense
 dbdr: struc t did too actually, as I just saw
 MSmits: now i wanna know what my submit does. gonna submit my current version. Just once, so it won't hurt dbdr too much
 dbdr: :grin:
 Washier: oof
 MSmits: then you can also correct your bot, if it is some apparent weakness
 Washier: here we go.
 dbdr:  othello grew slowly
 dbdr: 54 players
 jacek: yinsh grows slowlier
 MSmits: othello wouldnt be attractive to any but board game enthousiasts i think
 MSmits: yinish has much branching doesnt it?
 jacek: and more complicated rules
 MSmits: it's harder to write a search for games like that
 MSmits: like the tulips game
 dbdr: MSmits's version optimized to push jacek and trictac delivers so far&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: first draw vs you dbdr
 MSmits: some versions have 50% vs jacek or tric trac
 MSmits: not sure what this one has
 Washier: &lt;spectating, motuh open&gt;
 MSmits: nother draw :P
 Astrobytes: how does it fare against robo?
 MSmits: probabyl crappily
 MSmits: most did
 dbdr: looks like draws count
 MSmits: though once or twice hit 45% or so
 Washier: being whipped by oyu right now
 dbdr: i'm going down
 Washier: whipped
 Astrobytes: nice improvement btw Washier
 Washier: soldily
 MSmits: yeah they count a little bit, not sure how much
 Washier: ty
 Washier: and again
 MSmits: btw i didnt fit it to beat you dbdr
 Washier: they all matter to me MSmits. gg
 Astrobytes: I didn't do any othello past couple days, got sucked into doing optims and golf for the quest map
 MSmits: i fit it to maximize the score of the top 5 opponents on the board
 dbdr:  that's fair
 MSmits: obviously some version that beats you 30% is gonna be better than one that does 0%
 Washier: cool
 Washier: how tho? must work on my simming then. 
 Astrobytes: nice submit so far MSmits
 MSmits: yeah it peforms the way cg bench told me
 MSmits: i was assuming that if the cg bench says 100% vs renard, it will beat anyone below that
 Washier: cg bench. ok i'll shut up and rtfm
 Astrobytes: Assumption works
 MSmits: yep
 DomiKo: lul
 DomiKo: i still cant find time for othello&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: yeah just saw that
 Astrobytes: that hurt
 dbdr: oh, many people promoted
 dbdr: 18 now
 MSmits: lost most games vs dbdr in this submit
 MSmits: did really well vs 6th and downward though
 Washier: edge of seat
 MSmits: yay win vs dbdr :P
 MSmits: 1
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Washier: gg
 MSmits: so it's possible at least
 MSmits: currently trying to see if disk-count is good to have in eval. I didn't have it yet
 MSmits: mostly because i only read bad thigns about it
 dbdr: might be good with a negative sign
 Washier: same here for what its worth. very small part of my eval
 dbdr: early on
 Washier: ty
 MSmits: yeah, or positive, it really depends on how the rest of your eval  works
 dbdr: true
 MSmits: i am already giving bonuses to all edges and corners
 Washier: true. 
 dbdr: or imaginary
 MSmits: top 4 really is far far ahead of the rest
 MSmits: my bot has a hard time winning any
 MSmits: hmm well my previous submit had a 2 rating lead over 6th, now its 5.5 so I am happy
 dbdr: it's top 5  now&#160;;)
 MSmits: was already
 jacek: submit more, push me up, push push!
 Washier: must say, ties in with what MSmits says, eval is quite important for Othello. might be wrong
 dbdr: I mean, as a pack
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: it's in the ballpark
 inoryy: which multi are you discussing
 MSmits: Othello
 MSmits: Washier yes it is super important
 Washier: come play Inoryy
 MSmits: more important than what search type you're using
 Washier: ty MSmits
 inoryy: I don't have enough time to contirbute anymore unfortunately&#160;:( I just lurk here every now and then
 Washier: my broken experiments say the same.
 MSmits: we're happy to see you lurk
 MSmits: or not, because you're lurking
 Washier: absolutely.
 JBM: "we're happy to see you, for lurk or other at your convenience"
 Astrobytes: "I teach computers to play games"=&gt;"I lurk in chatrooms" :P
 jacek: but othello is so NN friendly
 inoryy: haha I still do the first part, just not on CG&#160;:) 
 Astrobytes: True
 dbdr: there are games outside of CG? :O
 dbdr: coding games?
 dbdr: how can that be? that's in the name
 Washier: haha
 JBM: still puzzled at that cg-for-work concept
 dbdr: (credits to A. Asimov)
 Washier: my fav writer
 Washier: *author
 dbdr: he has this story where people forgot how to do manual calculations, they just reproduce the blueprints for calculators and trust them
 MSmits: isn't that foundation?
 Washier: yes, with the abacus. 
 dbdr: no, it's a short story
 MSmits: oh ok
 Washier: space calculations. took months.
 dbdr: and someone rediscovers the principle of calculations, and others don't believe him
 dbdr: "calculation is by definition what is done on a calculator, how could you do it by hand?"
 Washier: Asimov's short stories are his best works imho
 eulerscheZahl: help!is this a troll or a clueless coder? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/community-puzzle-number-shifting/152425/43">https://forum.codingame.com/t/community-puzzle-number-shifting/152425/43</a>
 Astrobytes: Saw that, clueless I think
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm clueless how to respond
 jacek: it means number shifting is not clear enough
 JBM: just troll him
 JBM: wasn't it obvious?
 Astrobytes: Maybe he needs to be teamviewered
 JBM: what's that teamview meme?
 Astrobytes: MK
 JBM: too many occurences here to be a coincidence by now
 Astrobytes: He used to try to get people to let him teamview him, and succeeded a few times iirc
 eulerscheZahl: that teamviewer got so popular that one user asked me to connect to his PC and help him (i guess after MK treated him)
 Astrobytes: *let him teamview them
 JBM: i think my dad wants me to install it so i can debug his linux remotely
 JBM: no wai
 Washier: haha
 dbdr: Standard Error Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/66c8973f-7ea9-4a5f-8311-993c4b915fed">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/66c8973f-7ea9-4a5f-8311-993c4b915fed</a>
 MSmits: MK was weird about teamviewe
 dbdr: he's right, it does not work
 MSmits: he would just ask me to teamviewer for no reason
 Astrobytes: Never asked me, I feel cheated.
 JBM: yeah same
 JBM: missing out on the best cg had to offer
 eulerscheZahl: i tried that before i wrote the reply on the forum. now i'm confused it dbdr wants to troll me too
 JBM: you're our prime target
 Washier: you guys realise this chat is like a complicated soap opera?
 Washier: good thing.
 eulerscheZahl: you definitely missed some drama Washier
 JBM: such is life
 dbdr: oh, I'm moderator on the forum
 Washier: double haha
 eulerscheZahl: since Friday
 Astrobytes: Yeah, happened on FRiday dbdr
 Astrobytes: grrr
 eulerscheZahl: click the link in the private message. that admin interface has more semi-useful data than i expected
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it was much more feature-rich than I expected
 dbdr: "A critical update is available. Please upgrade!"
 JBM: ok now we're curious
 dbdr: hm, shouldn't have revealed that
 dbdr: If I had mod rights on the chat I would ban myself now
 eulerscheZahl: that's the first thing i saw too. and was about to share my thoughts in a PRIVATE message
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 dbdr: yeah, I'm dumb
 Washier: drama
 Washier: sure yo're not
 Astrobytes: Oh, euler/dbdr, try to access the FAQ from the hamburger menu and let me know if anything odd happens
 Astrobytes: In the forum I mean
 dbdr: yeah
 Washier: hamburger menu? pam pam paaa
 dbdr: CG in CG
 Astrobytes: Yeah, CG inception thingy
 eulerscheZahl: double status bar
 JBM: yeah noticed that the other day
 JBM: i almost reported it
 eulerscheZahl: someone reported that recently on discord. but without the step needed to get there
 JBM: then i thought better
 Astrobytes: haha
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.com/channels/466965651135922206/699972160688488468/729287605388312606">https://discord.com/channels/466965651135922206/699972160688488468/729287605388312606</a>
 Astrobytes: I was literally a second away from doing that
 Astrobytes: Well, you beat me so you can report it.
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/VuYADX.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/VuYADX.jpg</a>
 Astrobytes: That is awesome.
 JBM: ah, that famous discord sign-in page
 eulerscheZahl: i was faster dbdr :D
 dbdr: stealing my original work&#160;;)
 Washier: pam pam paaa
 eulerscheZahl: it's obvious by your avatar being shown everwhere so i don't feel like quoting
 dbdr: yeah&#160;:)
 dbdr: now I can choose one of 3 chatboxes to write into
 eulerscheZahl: when you ping yourself, you don't see it in the same tab
 eulerscheZahl: try the self-ping now
 dbdr: dbdr
 dbdr: no
 eulerscheZahl: nowhere red?
 dbdr: no
 dbdr: but it does not ping with pidgin either, so no big surprise
 dbdr: was worth a try though
 dbdr: hm, I could you could use alts in the inner frames :D
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i deleted them&#160;:(
 dbdr: to follow the rules?
 eulerscheZahl: and because i didn't need them anymore
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/codingame-game-engine/blob/master/engine/modules/entities/src/main/resources/view/entity-module/textUtils.js">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/codingame-game-engine/blob/master/engine/modules/entities/src/main/resources/view/entity-module/textUtils.js</a>now i understand why OOC was lagging with really long text messages
 dbdr: :scream:
 dbdr: those poor CPU cycles on our machines&#160;:(
 dbdr: PR incoming eulerscheZahl?
 dbdr: we should make a clash out of it
 Fxguy1: Ok, new here. Storing the FactoryID with the highest troops, but cant figure out why that ID isnt changing once conditions change? 
 eulerscheZahl: mehbut binary search would be smarter here
 Fxguy1: It changes with adding a new factory, but once the old factory surpasses the new in troops, it wont change back
 eulerscheZahl: i like your clash idea :D
 dbdr: Am I missing something, or shouldn't it be O(1)?
 dbdr: or are you joking?
 eulerscheZahl: it renders the text over and over again in pixi to know the width in pixels
 dbdr: ah, it's in pixels
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: that's what I was missing
 eulerscheZahl: so either binary search or go the opposite direction (start with empty string) i would say
 dbdr: yeah, starting from empty is easy and technically O(1)&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: trying to draw anything without the entity module, not that easy&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: struct got it working. never committed and is ghosting us now
 dbdr: how is this related?
 eulerscheZahl: was curious what that utils file contains
 dbdr: the if is useless, btw
 dbdr: though that's a smaller problem
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, part of the while
 dbdr: font: { size: state.fontSize || 1
 dbdr: must be useful to have font size 1 :D
 dbdr: if that's in pt
 dbdr: maybe not
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff04379f-bad9-4641-b5d9-3fdbf9e004c9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff04379f-bad9-4641-b5d9-3fdbf9e004c9</a>
 dbdr: seems like the default would be better than 1
 JBM: if useless? only in absence of... wait for it... SIDE EFFECTS
 JBM: screw bypassing the entity module, I want to get rid of pixi altogether
 eulerscheZahl: it's possible. but i want to finish my game one day
 JBM: priorities and compromise
 eulerscheZahl: and when using the SDK, i'm close to 1MB after 100 frames already
 eulerscheZahl: so i might exceed it in certain worst-case games
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 JBM: 1MB sounds like nothing
 eulerscheZahl: 1MB is the limit for a single replay
 eulerscheZahl: CG doesn't allow more
 JBM: oh 1MB of game replay data?
 eulerscheZahl: which is why i already filed a PR for the toggle module this morning
 JBM: silly me, i thought "tab RAM use"
 eulerscheZahl: yes, 1MB json file
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 jacek: did atari go fix it?
 JBM: using a more compact format seems like the easiest of what's possible with theirr module system
 eulerscheZahl: but forces me to create my own sprites i think
 JBM: well, or link back to the js side of GEM
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i'm trying
 JBM: good luck!
 JBM: i know i certainly considered all i could to bypass that mess for tvc
 JBM: and threw the towel, too much for me for a first game
 eulerscheZahl: TVC doesn't really need to bypass it
 eulerscheZahl: much less going on in that replay
 JBM: i merely wishes very dearly to
 eulerscheZahl: yay, my first inserted image \o/
 JBM: on bypass?
 eulerscheZahl: on calling the EntityModule in JS
 JBM: yay gg
 eulerscheZahl: so it has an ID and all the benefits from the EntityModule
 eulerscheZahl: handles viewer resize and everything
 JBM: and fwd/bck in the replay
 eulerscheZahl: it's a static thing, background-like
 eulerscheZahl: that will be the next step
 JBM: please blog :p
 eulerscheZahl: and i want to reference to it in the toggle module
 JBM: so to react on the "tvc doesn't need it", i'm just so uncomfortable with my CPU pegging to 100% when tvc is open, even if the viewer is perfectly idle
 JBM: browser-based animation doesn't need to be that sloppy
 eulerscheZahl: then you definitely have to replace pixi entirely
 JBM: i know&#160;:(
 JBM: and the sdk is definitely not going to help me on that path
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.github.io/NumberShifting.html">https://eulerschezahl.github.io/NumberShifting.html</a>there isn't much going on, yet enough to make my laptop's fans turn on
 eulerscheZahl: and i don't think that i coded it badly
 JBM: i know the feeling
 eulerscheZahl: oh, I always thought setScale() would be a "cheap" command in the SDKit translates into 2 commands for x and y scale :o
 JBM: does that make it expensive?
 JBM: isn't there a setMatrix() they could compress all of those to?
 eulerscheZahl: a little more json data
 JBM: oh, right, that's your bottleneck
 vireakpanha: Hi
 icecream17: i just noticed the quest map.
 jacek: what quest map
 icecream17: at the home screen. think its something new
 jacek: O:
 icecream17: by just clicking ive levelled up twice
 icecream17: lol
 jacek: nowai
 MSmits: mmh i think i found a bug in the c++ language assist
 MSmits: If I page my 1 line opening book between two "   "    it cuts off at the end and it colors the rest of the code as if it is a string 
 MSmits: even though the bot works fine
 MSmits: page = paste
 MSmits: doesn't show any errors though
 MSmits: just the whole thing is orange after the start of the string
 MSmits: dont really care as I am not in the habit of coding with really long lines in the IDE
 MSmits: but it's weird
 eulerscheZahl: others reported issues with long lines too
 eulerscheZahl: up to the website completely freezing
 jacek: eeyup
 MoazCodeM4n: yo :sunglasses:
 MSmits: mmh maybe thats why it's being cut off now with -...-  at the end?
 MSmits: they just forgot to add the closing " for the language assist
 MSmits: I am guessing they fixed the freezing and added this bug
 dbdr: "forgot"
 MSmits: yep
 dbdr: it's asking much to modify your code but keep it syntactically correct
 MSmits: what I mean is, they forgot to make the language assist read the code as if the "; is still in there
 RoboStac: it's done that since the new editor msmits
 MSmits: oh ok
 RoboStac: displays larger lines with ... on the end and breaks formatting
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: 2020 and some editors still don't handle long lines
 dbdr: that stuff was solved in the 70s
 dbdr: just need to use the right data structures and algorithms
 MSmits: my opening book would not fit in 70s RAM though
 dbdr: but the algo could still be able to handle it&#160;:)
 MSmits: true
 RoboStac: it probably didn't try to syntax highlight it in the 70's though&#160;:)
 dbdr: true
 MSmits: especially since they only had 1 color...
 MSmits: yellow?
 dbdr: you can do bold in monochrome&#160;:)
 MSmits: true
 jacek: *impossibru*
 jacek: argh
 dbdr: early syntax highligting would just show keywords
 jacek: **x**
 MSmits: your autocorrect on bro-speak again jacek?
 dbdr: which you can do in constant time
 jacek: tried to bold message
 dbdr: *x*&#160;?
 dbdr: x
 dbdr: works in pidgin&#160;:)
 MSmits: i dont see bold
 dbdr: you would in pidgin
 MSmits: i deinstalled pidgin
 dbdr: probably webchat does not support it
 jacek: deinstalled... who says that
 <b>**dbdr has this though</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: only used it once because I needed some secretive hacker chatroom thingy
 MSmits: had to decrypt a codeword to get in even
 dbdr: real hackers write their own XMPP client&#160;;)
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: they were amateurs
 MSmits: btw disc-count does not look promising as an eval feature in othello
 MSmits: tried some values, 0 is still best as a weight
 MSmits: maybe i need to start at 0 and give it  a weight * (60- empty squares)
 MSmits: or make the 60 also a weight
 MSmits: well ... a parameter i mean
 dbdr: wieght*60 is a constant
 MSmits: yeah you can take it out of the parentheses
 dbdr: changing 60 would change nothing would it?
 MSmits: i am just trying to make it look sensical
 MSmits: this is multiplied with the disc-count
 MSmits: so it would
 dbdr: ah yes, sorry
 MSmits: it would be a constant weight + a weight dependent on how deep into the game you are
 MSmits: maybe something like  (400 - 20 * empty) * weight * disccount
 dbdr: make sure you have a discount variable too
 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: so typos go unnoticed&#160;;)
 MSmits: disc-count
 dbdr: I know
 dbdr: have both
 MSmits: really?
 MSmits: you do?
 dbdr: no, I mean that's super dangerous
 MSmits: ahh ok
 dbdr: make a typo and it will still compile, just do something stupid
 MSmits: or something that puts me at nr 1
 MSmits: it happens
 dbdr: could very well happen
 MSmits: worst thing is when a bug makes your bot better and you want to fix it, but you cant
 dbdr: wasn't penicilin discovered by mistake?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: he left a fungus and bacteria on a petri dish
 MSmits: as you do
 MSmits: I'm sure if i took a microscope into my bathroom I could discover penicilin all over the place
 dbdr: there was also a guy who predicted the existence of a planet, a few centuries ago
 MSmits: uranus
 dbdr: someone looked, and it was exactly there, and people were amazed
 MSmits: yes
 dbdr: turned out the formula was quite wrong
 MSmits: Dutch guy of course
 dbdr: it was just a lucky time when it did not matter
 dbdr: yes?
 MSmits: I think so
 dbdr: I think he was french :D
 Astrobytes: Fleming was Scotttish, we're terrible microbiologists
 Astrobytes: *Scottish
 Astrobytes: (penicillin guy)
 MSmits: mmh i am trying to look it up
 MSmits: Neptune was predicted before disovery
 MSmits: says wiki
 MSmits: nah i was wrong, it was Neptune
 Astrobytes: Le Verrier
 MSmits: French guy and Britisch guy both predicted i
 jacek: maybe someone else discovered uranus
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 MSmits: but not by math
 MSmits: Neptune was the first to be discovered by math
 Astrobytes: I hope Uranus is explored one day jacek
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/5-J6gW_w_Hs?t=648">https://youtu.be/5-J6gW_w_Hs?t=648</a>
 Astrobytes: Lecture any good?
 Astrobytes: Seems watchable, might save it to watch later
 MSmits: seems ok
 MSmits: Urbain was a gangster
 dbdr: yeah :D
 Astrobytes: yeah
 Astrobytes: Guy's got good delivery
 Scarfield: there is very likely another planet in our system, that still havent been discovered. 1 sec
 jacek: urectrum
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/mike_brown_the_search_for_our_solar_system_s_ninth_planet">https://www.ted.com/talks/mike_brown_the_search_for_our_solar_system_s_ninth_planet</a>
 dbdr: that's the main topic of that video
 dbdr: and this guy's research
 Scarfield: oh the video you linked, just assumed it was about Neptune/Uranus
 Astrobytes: clue's in the title&#160;;)
 Scarfield: lol, just joined and wanted to share, didnt read much of chat. but its really cool
 Scarfield: 5-J6g.. real give away :p
 Scarfield: didnt click the link xD
 Astrobytes: The *video* title not the url Impatientfiield
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Scarfield: its kind of crazy that there could be another planet so "close" and it hasnt been spotted. but we have pictures of other galaxies "slightly" futher away
 dbdr: need to do casear decoding on the URL
 dbdr: yes I did too many clashes
 eulerscheZahl: 48+2
 jacek:  i think i saw some lecture how we can see far things but not close ones
 jacek: like they discovered recently proxima centauri planet
 Scarfield: i guess the star in revolves around, and the angle between them makes it easier
 dbdr: isn't it because we see the light of stars?
 dbdr: and of their planets passing in front?
 dbdr: unlike an outer solar planet
 Scarfield: that would make sense, also the star will change its movement based on the planets orbit, so that could be one way of looking for where the planet should be
 dbdr: but yeah, it's weird. it feels like you should just be able to look around to see what's there&#160;:)
 dbdr: space is big and empty
 Astrobytes: Well, it's only empty if you're looking for what you can see&#160;;)
 Scarfield: "Its called space, because there is a lot of it"
 dbdr: it's full of vacuum?
 Scarfield: space, its full of space :p
 Astrobytes: My God, it's full of... something
 Astrobytes: No, I mean like dark matter
 Scarfield: like me, ive been told 
 Astrobytes: lol
 RShields: very brave of dyson engineers to go all the way out to space to harness the vacuum for our vacuum cleaners
 Astrobytes: Dyson sucks
 RShields: what vacuum company doesn't
 Astrobytes: Quite
 Scarfield: hmm or do they blow :thinking:
 RShields: gonna make me a vacuum company that doesn't suck
 RShields: it only makes money via stock buybacks
 poopooooo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AioVDsXidh0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AioVDsXidh0</a>
 RShields: dyson does indeed blow too
 RShields: if a fan blows, it necessarily sucks
 Zenoscave: As you can see it sucks as it cuts
 Astrobytes: lol poopooooo, what a movie
 jacek: is it made in java
 JBM: i love indonesia
 pedrosorio: top20 in clash of code, finally!
 TLun: congratz
 pedrosorio: :bow:
 FLQ4: how 
 FLQ4: i wish i was top 20 
 FLQ4: but i am 7000 something
 FLQ4: do you have some tips on how i can get a higher rank 
 JBM: play more
 JBM: (experts only) play better
 FLQ4: k
 Rachit1510: hii
 AntiSquid: add to CV: i am good at coc
 wes337: i am not
 wes337: i feel like an idiot when i play coc
 jjhiggz: it pisses me off that python has .capitalize haha
 jjhiggz: like I was wondering how I got crushed in JS
 poopooooo: tfw python gang keeps getting crushed by ruby gang&#160;;(
 Feeg4ever: HELLO
 Feeg4ever: yippie, yippie yeah
 Feeg4ever: this is awesome
 Feeg4ever: anybody
 Feeg4ever: i need a gig
 Feeg4ever: somebody?
 Feeg4ever: what is coc?
 Feeg4ever: sound like cock?
 benschreyer: people who use ruby == tryhards
 Andriamanitra: people who use ruby enjoy life more because it's the most fun language
 Zenoscave: people who evangelize languages are likely to not understand that a language is a tool and often times a tool is meant for a task. There isn't one language that is "best" 
 Andriamanitra: no one said best, just fun
 Zenoscave: I agree with the fact that it is a fun language, I have yet to find one that is most fun, though.
 Zenoscave: elixir is a blast
 Zenoscave: think erlang + ruby
 Zenoscave: I misread sorry
 fccloud: it does not matter what language you use. a language is a tool and you use whatever tool you're most comfortable with and does the job the best
 Feeg4ever: hello, fellas
 Feeg4ever: trying to solve a problem this late
 Feeg4ever: with right tools of course!!
 Feeg4ever: and that is python!!!!!!
 fccloud: sure
 Feeg4ever: right?guys==
 Feeg4ever: what is your favorite "tool"?or "toys".. ehm ehm
 Allis: Regarding languages: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/0la5DBtOVNI">https://youtu.be/0la5DBtOVNI</a>
 Andriamanitra: you can't really say the language does not matter, although there are often many perfectly reasonable choices it's obvious that some are better than others
 fccloud: yes, of course. each tool has its specialty
 Feeg4ever: yes, right, that is PYTHON 
 Feeg4ever: ehm... 
 Feeg4ever: just accept the truth
 Feeg4ever: embrace the truth..
 fccloud: i'd say python's okay for short scripts but as it gets longer the performance drawback is too bad
 Kariin: lmao
 Feeg4ever: ok, {that hurts}
 Feeg4ever: you are right. {that is bullshit!!}
 fccloud: with zero optimization i was able to update a 10k by 10k array with random values 120 times faster in java than i was able to do in python
 fccloud: with threading the difference grew to 150
 Andriamanitra: in my experience it's very rare that the speed of a language is a bottleneck in the real world
 Feeg4ever: what about coding in binary?
 Feeg4ever: is that better=
 fccloud: that's assembly/machine code
 fccloud: basically the most performance you can get
 Feeg4ever: no not assebly, step the level.
 Feeg4ever: just binary
 Feeg4ever: like 0 and 1
 fccloud: machine language then
 fccloud: but python is such a high level language (it's easy to write) that you cannot get performance out of it
 Feeg4ever: anyone good at it?
 fccloud: i have run into performance issues with python. i recommend you try other languages after you get one down
 Feeg4ever: like which language?
 Feeg4ever: c?
 Feeg4ever: c++?
 Feeg4ever: or c#?
 fccloud: in terms of level, c#/java or maybe js is a step down from python
 fccloud: you can work your way down from there
 fccloud: c++ probably after that
 fccloud: c++ can do everything c can
 fccloud: and you can go wherever you feel honestly
 Feeg4ever: what about C#? 
 Feeg4ever: tell me about it.
 Feeg4ever: im interested in C#
 fccloud: c# is really nice for interfacing with the OS
 Feeg4ever: thats my boy!!!!!!!!
 fccloud: it is strict typing and strict oop tho
 fccloud: that's probably the biggest change from py
 Feeg4ever: still my boy!!!!!!!
 Feeg4ever: thank you man
 Feeg4ever: from the creator of C#
 fccloud: although c# is a tiny bit slower than java it's still tens-hundreds times faster than java
 Andriamanitra: if you're trying to get a benchmark score down in a coding game then sure go learn c or c++ but if you want to actually get stuff done then python is a fine choice
 Feeg4ever: alright.
 Feeg4ever: any other showmen? 
 Feeg4ever: guys , three languages that is a must 
 Feeg4ever: GO!
 Feeg4ever: THREE LANGUAGE THAT IS A MUST TO HAVE..
 Feeg4ever: GO!!!!!!!!
 Allis: That really is like asking which three screwdrivers are the best.
 Allis: You need to fix your thinking.
 Feeg4ever: HAHA
 Feeg4ever: OH men
 Feeg4ever: i mean ... what if the world is about to end.
 Feeg4ever: and you have to save ti
 Feeg4ever: it
 Allis: Then you probably wanna learn Forth so you can hack on CollapseOS.
 Feeg4ever: whooo
 Feeg4ever: i would call my grandpa
 Feeg4ever: what is CollapseOS?
 Feeg4ever: short explaination pls
 Andriamanitra: my list would be javascript for web, python for scripting and getting shit done quickly, and julia for fun and maths
 Feeg4ever: that is what im talking about.
 Feeg4ever: that is nice list tho
 Feeg4ever: you are prepared. 
 Feeg4ever: anyone else?
 RShields: Use the right language for the job
 RShields: And that means, know what's different between different langs
 RShields: I would not try to write webcode in Haskell and I would not try to write an OS in Python
 Feeg4ever: right, i dont know alot about other programming languages and what they suitable for.
 Feeg4ever: im a noob alright { confession }
 Feeg4ever: im not what you think i am alright. { another confession }
 Feeg4ever: please say something. { i wanna leave }
 RShields: As far as if you're picking languages to learn, you need to learn either C or C++ at some point, just because they have raw memory management, pointers, that stuff
 RShields: JS is basically required for web dev, so that's on the list
 Andriamanitra: i disagree with that, although c is such a simple language you can probably learn the basics in an hour
 Feeg4ever: memories are my friends. good for game hacking.
 Andriamanitra: raw memory management is not something your average programmer needs to know in 2020
 RShields: you may not need to use it, but you should know how
 Feeg4ever: i agree with you.
 RShields: C++ is also still a very used language, and if you go into C++ dev, you need to know how pointers work to know how shared pointers work, etc.
 Feeg4ever: do you think that in future, somebody with a new programming lanugage? a really good one, suitable for everything?
 RShields: No
 Andriamanitra: quite the opposite, people keep coming up with domain-specific languages for *very* specific tasks
 Feeg4ever: then i will not plan it.
 RShields: Well, it's a trick question because in a literal sense, C++ is already that language
 RShields: The thing is, yeah, people write languages that are specifically suited to each task, so as a master-of-none language, C++ isn't the best for any task
 Andriamanitra: i think c++ is a terribly designed language from a syntax perspective to be quite honest
 RShields: It's definitely dated
 Feeg4ever: what bad about C#?
 Feeg4ever: bad OOP?
 RShields: C# is a good language which nobody uses
 Feeg4ever: oh men, im gonna be alone
 RShields: And as it develops, it's becoming a frankenlang
 Feeg4ever: frankenlang?
 Feeg4ever: what it is means?
 RShields: it's got ideas from all over the place
 RShields: bit of this, bit of that
 Feeg4ever: that is right.
 Feeg4ever: i kind see that
 Feeg4ever: it is becoming frankenlang
 RShields: C# will probably always target Windows a little better than Linux or Mac
 Andriamanitra: i've never seen the appeal of c#, just seems like a slightly less terrible and less portable version of java
 Andriamanitra: i guess people love their visual studio
 RShields: the syntax has a bunch of incremental improvements over Java
 Feeg4ever: i realize that visual studio does alot in background.
 Feeg4ever: is that good? i dont like it
 Feeg4ever: i feel dump
 Feeg4ever: it makes me feel dumb
 Feeg4ever: what you  think?
 RShields: and portability difference is like, anything you can't target with C# you should be writing C for anyway
 RShields: :3
 RShields: "doing a lot in the background" isn't good or bad per se
 RShields: it's about *what* you're doing
 Andriamanitra: mobile? in c?
 RShields: you can target mobile with C#
 Feeg4ever: yeah
 Feeg4ever: i wanna be a hacker. im gonna be arreseted.
 Feeg4ever: arrested.
 Feeg4ever: have you hacked into anything?
 Feeg4ever: in your life?
 RShields: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/supported-platforms/">https://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/supported-platforms/</a>
 Feeg4ever: dont klick it
 Feeg4ever: virus!!!!!!!
 Feeg4ever: just kidding
 Feeg4ever: good hacker
 Feeg4ever: white hacker
 Feeg4ever: black hacker
 Feeg4ever: and grey hacker
 Feeg4ever: and also red hacker
 Feeg4ever: you guys are getting sleepy.
 RShields: hacking is almost always, make a phone call to someone stupid, say you're IT, and ask for their username and password
 Feeg4ever: Haha
 Feeg4ever: hacking the satellite. start the laser beam... then booom
 Andriamanitra: very true, humans are almost always the weakest link in any security system
 Feeg4ever: what an AI will code for us?
 Feeg4ever: make it secure.
 Feeg4ever: is that possible?
 RShields: who will write the ai
 Feeg4ever: the humans!
 Feeg4ever: oh i get it
 Feeg4ever: okey...
 Feeg4ever: neverming
 Feeg4ever: nevermind
 Oregane: maybe they'll do something like caml, get a bunch of mathematicians to check the thing is secure and when you add anything, make it auto check itself
 rajington: js is all about the ecosystem and not a standard library, should at least have access to lodash/underscore
 rajington: for the length ones, use `var` or `let` instead of `const`, much shorter
 rajington: and drop unnecessary spaces
 rajington: or variable allocation

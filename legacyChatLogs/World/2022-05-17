 5DN1L: Big_Code because the formatting code does not add leading zeroes for you. You have to specify the required format yourself
 Big_Code: I'm still a bit confused, cause both 100101, and 0100101 both equal&#160;%. So for this exercise, I literally have to add a 0 to the beginning of %s binary value? 
 5DN1L: Yes, you do, the puzzle statement says you need 7 bits for every character
 Big_Code: Yea it does state that the "Input message" has a 7-bit ascii character, never would have assumed I'd have to manually add a bit. But thanks for the clarification
 5DN1L: Yes, it is not written very clearly, but the requirement is that
 5DN1L: np

 doogyman: cool
 MSmits: it's a nice list eulerscheZahl, but it doesn't really do justice to codingame. Unless any of those other sites have 50 bot arenas and optimization rankings
 MSmits: kinda makes it seem like CG is mediocre if you're just looking at that list

 TINOUAINANI: whay they can,t add c++20&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: :salt:
 Astrobytes: Not required for their business side I guess. 
 Astrobytes: Strange for them to upgrade g++ and not bother though
 eulerscheZahl: maybe they tried and ran into some problems?
 Astrobytes: Normally they mention it if their intention was to upgrade language version as well as compiler
 TINOUAINANI: its not fair , we need c++20 for shertes mod
 Astrobytes: try ruby
 Astrobytes: or python
 TINOUAINANI: yah even with c++20 no chance with those guys
 jacek: nerf python plx
 eulerscheZahl: forbid system calls and unicode
 SandmanSW96: Hey quick question...
 SandmanSW96: I don't think google can find the answer to this one
 eulerscheZahl: i opened google anyways, bring it on
 SandmanSW96: Okay, what YOYO decided to choose a clash that requires 30 decimal places, restricted to a language that only goes up to 29?
 SandmanSW96: lol and.... go
 eulerscheZahl: what's the task?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you don't even need floating points
 SandmanSW96: To put numbers into decimal notation, if non repeating include the whole thing
 SandmanSW96: no it doesn't give enough of them period lol.  Test 4 literally wants 30 digit precision for the answer
 eulerscheZahl: can you share the task?
 SandmanSW96: it was the c# event clash just now
 Astrobytes: if you remember anything about it, keywords, the name etc we can look it up
 SandmanSW96: aka =&gt;   input  was 11, 24   and 11/24 was 0.4583333333,
 eulerscheZahl: astro understands me
 SandmanSW96: output =&gt; 0.458(3)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5824d5a473f5c894b379b9803f0a6dc78a18">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5824d5a473f5c894b379b9803f0a6dc78a18</a>
 eulerscheZahl: denominator is less than 1000
 SandmanSW96: divide a/b and format the decimal
 eulerscheZahl: did you learn how do divide with pen and paper?
 VirtualRealityRocks: Yes I believe that's the one EulerscheZahl
 SandmanSW96: lol how many other languages don't have to write extra code for that
 b0n5a1: o/
 SandmanSW96: now if that was the reason to choose that one for c#, to make it trickier then i get that,
 b0n5a1: SandmanSW96 you should try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/recurring-decimals">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/recurring-decimals</a>
 eulerscheZahl: even python does not have unlimited precision for floating point
 SandmanSW96: but if it was just an oversight lol,
 SandmanSW96: then that's just sad lmao
 SandmanSW96: was a nice monkey wrench and all, if it was intentional kudos.  tc lol
 eulerscheZahl: first of all: clashes are intended for all languages. these events artificially limit the language while using the same pool of questions
 eulerscheZahl: i can't see the author's solution but i don't think that it works with built-in division
 Westicles: this one is seemed questionable as well
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/546313e8a5acd8d16b10e6c03cfea1f6d7bc">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/546313e8a5acd8d16b10e6c03cfea1f6d7bc</a>
 SandmanSW96: lol you had me at "bring it on", take care i said my peace
 SandmanSW96: my point =&gt; if someone set that up completely by accident it was a bonehead thing to do lol  that's all
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm pretty sure that using the division of your programming language is not the intended solution
 Astrobytes: Quite tough for a clash, compared to the majority I see
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but still doable without extra hoops in any language
 Astrobytes: Yep. I think that guy misunderstood the problem.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: getcontext().prec = 50
 eulerscheZahl: PHP magic?
 eulerscheZahl: does this work beyond double precision?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I googled python precision for Decimal class
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it worked. didn't know about that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: actual precision for certain functions is still only 15 places...like sqrt... I don't know how it fills in the rest
 PatrickMcGinnisII: at least PHP has BC math functions, they are slow AF...but they are better than the guessing game of .00000001
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl.clone(); would probably solve the world's problems. :joy:
 Westicles: this derivative puzzle is brutal.  you have to implement the derivative and then an eval if your language doesn't have it
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII don't forget to cast
 PatrickMcGinnisII: (smitsimax) world *=
 PatrickMcGinnisII: better?
 MSmits: sure
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops:  throws exception

 Astrobytes: And modest.

 waterproofsodium: I just wanted a taco
 waterproofsodium: thought "nom" was the right way to trigger that
 waterproofsodium: and don't call me Madam please Sir
 waterproofsodium: also since you're asking:
 waterproofsodium: I'm kinda stuck with the bulls and cows problem sigh
 waterproofsodium: seems quite complicated? can someone confirm? xD
 MSmits: it's  a difficult optim
 waterproofsodium: that it requires at least handling 3 complicated cases
 waterproofsodium: optim in what sense MSmits?
 MSmits: to get an initial solution that is
 MSmits: oh you mean the puzzle?
 aCat: optimization game&#160;;]
 MSmits: there is an optimization game and a puzzle
 waterproofsodium: yeah "bulls and cows"
 waterproofsodium: puzzle
 aCat: ah, I skipped both&#160;;]
 MSmits: oh ok, that puzzle wasn't too hard for me, but i played a lot of the game as a child.
 waterproofsodium: well it seems interesting so i wanna do it
 MSmits: it is. Let me see what my solution is, maybe i can give a hint
 Astrobytes: aCat: I am at last working on a locam: Constructed bot&#160;;)
 waterproofsodium: is there a trick to it maybe? since you played it a loot
 waterproofsodium: i don't even have a half solution by now
 MSmits: I bruteforced it
 waterproofsodium: think I don't really want a hint at this point even
 aCat: Astrobytes&#160;:*
 waterproofsodium: often I'm just looking for a reason not to give up
 MSmits: I tried all combinations with all information. If any of the scores are incorrect when combined with a solution-try, it means it failed
 MSmits: I will show a small snippet:
 waterproofsodium: deja vouz xD
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/859a083d-0694-41a1-af00-591d3652e080">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/859a083d-0694-41a1-af00-591d3652e080</a>
 MSmits: so i brute force all code combinations this way
 MSmits: and check them against the scores
 MSmits: program is around 120 lines in total, but it's C# and it's me, so a bit wordy and long
 waterproofsodium: sigh
 waterproofsodium: "if any are incorrect when combined with solution"..
 waterproofsodium: ofc
 waterproofsodium: why didn't I think of that
 waterproofsodium: seriously why haha
 MSmits: well i thought of it because that is what i do when i play the actual game
 waterproofsodium: nice
 MSmits: I try stuff and check against previous scores
 waterproofsodium: that's a good answer to my question
 MSmits: it's a fun game, but the last 1 or 2 turns before i solve it, i need to think for like 10 minutes
 MSmits: the fewer solutions possible, the harder it is to find one
 MSmits: and the more scores you get, the more limited the solution-space becomes
 karimbjjj: i cant get the input just yet 
 karimbjjj: i have a hard time understanding this site

 waterproofsodium: Husoski how do I retire once?
 Darleanow: Anyone not sleeping&#160;?
 Darleanow: i need help on the eval function
 Darleanow: i'm asking for the user the enter a print with an arg in it, e.g&#160;: print("Helloworld")
 Darleanow: but when i return the result in an f string like so :print(f"Résultat obtenu&#160;:\n{eval(PremierEx)}")
 Darleanow: it prints Hello world before, and prints none right after
 Husoski: Darleanow You know that print() always returns None, right?
 Darleanow: i don't lol
 Husoski: ...so if you eval("print('hello')"), you'll get 'hello' printed, but the expression return None
 Darleanow: indeed&#160;!
 dot.nick: tfw just me and 3 bots in a clash lobby for a minute there
 Darleanow: But how do i do if i want the user to print something
 Darleanow: like in an input&#160;?
 Husoski: You want to print the value *and* use what was printed?
 Husoski: Here's an idea I use for debugging:
 Darleanow: i got a solution
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f688a75b-ea99-45db-b9bd-f742d9f27251">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f688a75b-ea99-45db-b9bd-f742d9f27251</a>
 Darleanow: it's not really like using the function print in a py command line, but almost&#160;:)
 Husoski: You can also front-end python's print() function with something like:def print(*a, **k, _print=print):
 Husoski: I use something like that for debugging.  The above prints (with keywords, if needed) and returns a list of the positional arguments printed.  You won't get the effect of sep= or end= keywords in that list, though.
 Darleanow: this is a bit too technical for me
 Darleanow: i'll try to implement it
 Darleanow: _print=print
 Darleanow: throws an error
 Darleanow:&#160;;.
 Darleanow: Parameter cannot follow "**" parameter
 Husoski: Oh...yes...put **k last.
 Darleanow: ty&#160;:)
 Husoski: gn
 Darleanow: &gt;&gt;&gt;print("Hello World")Hello WorldRésultat obtenu&#160;:('Hello World',)
 Darleanow: gives this&#160;:/
 Wild_Python: which is better to lrean&#160;:(((
 Wild_Python: java or javascript
 Darleanow: depends on ur needs&#160;:)
 Darleanow: imma assume java is more for app dev focused, and js is more for like web 
 Husoski: Oh...it's a tuple?  I thought *a made a list.  You can return ' '.join(a) instead to simulate what print usually does.
 Darleanow: TOO GOOD
 Darleanow: eval(PremierEx)
 Husoski: ...or get a bit trickier and check for sep= and end= values in k
 Darleanow: works perfectly
 Darleanow: it's getting out of my spirit..
 Darleanow: but the print is now modified right&#160;?
 Darleanow: how will it behave differently&#160;?
 Husoski: Nope.  Just make "print" refer to your function in your namespace (local or your modules globals)  You can always `del print` to make that go away and use the real one.  Or pass eval a dict for locals or globals to just use that print function during the eval().  Lots of options.
 Husoski: Or define the funny functon as "my_print" instead of "print"  and then:print = my_print
 Husoski: result=eval(blah)del print
 Darleanow: OH GREATTTTTT
 Darleanow: you're too good sir, sadly i'm not seeing you quite often in here
 Husoski: Im usually clashing or working on a puzzle.
 Husoski: Right now, I was just on the language version page to compare with what's on CodeWars and saw your question.
 Husoski: I'm disappearing now to get in a little guitar practice before bed.  Good night!

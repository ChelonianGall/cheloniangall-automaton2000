 U.N.Owen: If u go to their profile it shows, but apart from that, I don't know of any way
 U.N.Owen: in their bio
 Crypticsy: hey, only 2 days left for the validation so could you give it a try&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: so you want us to tell which number appears how often and not print numbers with 0 occurences?
 eulerscheZahl: what a complex way of describing that
 Crypticsy: yeah XD
 eulerscheZahl: then i think i know why noone wants to approve it
 Thyl: Yo&#160;!
 MOSTAFA: why this compiler doesn't understand 
 MOSTAFA: int .Parse
 MOSTAFA:&#160;?
 MOSTAFA: C#
 alexfacciorusso: Maybe try `Int32.Parse`?
 eulerscheZahl: int.Parse is fine too. we need more context
 whay: hi
 tendai1km: cac
 tendai1km: :rage:
 jacek: :o
 tatabusa: hi
 jiki: :tophat:
 jacek: lazy sunday eh
 eulerscheZahl: where did my struct go?haven't seen him for about a week&#160;:(
 jacek: lost in js madness
 jacek: unrecoverable
 jacek: what have you done
 eulerscheZahl: and he writes game engines like he plays contests...was working on it for weeks without a single git push&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Maybe the JS finally drove him insane
 eulerscheZahl: i thought it could cure him, - * - = +
 jacek: cure of life

 Schwase: is today the day im gonna finally leave path finding...
 Schwase: maybe
 Schwase: ima try again
 remi6: Hello!
 remi6: Hi MathieuGanesan. It is awesome to see you playing CoC today too! Let's do our best.
 icecream17: Wow. pb4's win against me is... wow. wow.

 JBM: !ban
 remi6: ad99526, is it a private one?
 icecream17: italready strated
 remi6: Yeah, I can see that. I wonder whether it is a custom game or not.
 icecream17: no

 ad99526: anyone up?
 icecream17: don't post the same link 3 times in a row..... just one... i was working on something and now i got distracted
 tiwariji264: hi
 Astrobytes: ad99526 Please do not spam the chat with clash invites
 Astrobytes: Just asking is enough
 icecream17: WHAT!? I threw -1 stones
 JBM: you cheater
 JBM: burn!
 icecream17: =)
 icecream17: I threw (number - 2 * othernumber)
 acm: how do i close the char
 Scarfield: if you mean chat, the triangle "play" icon below
 acm: thanks very much
 acm: the ui is unintuitive as hell
 beginnerscripterlol: theres a little arrow bottom left corner
 beginnerscripterlol: clic kitr
 beginnerscripterlol: click it*
 JBM: but it's unintuituve
 icecream17: jbm your contribution is amazing
 jacek: hm?
 icecream17: troll vs castles
 Thyl: Hi&#160;!
 jacek: me vs castles?
 Silsquad: Anybody that does Coders Strike Back know how to display text next to your pod?
 eulerscheZahl: x y speed messagejust append it at the end
 Silsquad: Thanks got it!
 JBM: icecream17: thank you---what do you like most about it?
 icecream17: The game has simple rules but is very complex
 icecream17: Also the silly things, like the messages and the mountain
 Astrobytes: That artwork tho' :heart_eyes_cat:
 JBM: i put all my love into it
 icecream17: that castle when it falls down
 JBM: i've got a special alternate animation for that one coming up for when i complete multiround
 Laminator: Some real contenders up in clash right now. 
 JBM: clashes suck
 hhdhwuus: same
 Laminator: how do they suck? 
 JBM: improper rhythm, bots, cheaters, and downslope om the contributions' quality
 Astrobytes: With their mouths ofc :P
 Astrobytes: JBM, just noticed your little place on the web, look forward to more
 JBM: oh lol i forgot about that one lately
 JBM: i'll be sure to tell about my trolling progress
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 Laminator: There are cheaters?
 JBM: it's a game
 JBM: mmmtalking about it, i need a favicon
 Astrobytes: Tiny troll, or perhaps it's fig leaf
 Astrobytes: *its
 JBM: i'm going for way more subtle
 Astrobytes: A blank image with steganographically encoded information?
 JBM: maybe later
 JBM: for now, just an ellipse and an ellipse section
 JBM: how do i configure apache so that if the request contains the string "php", IP is banned and nothing is logged?
 JBM: this is eating up on my disk quota
 inoryy: are you sure you want to do it on the apache level?
 JBM: of course not
 inoryy: then I'd recommend setting up iptables
 JBM: to check the tcp's first line?
 JBM: it can do that?
 inoryy: something like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/825481/iptable-rule-to-drop-packet-with-a-specific-substring-in-payload">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/825481/iptable-rule-to-drop-packet-with-a-specific-substring-in-payload</a>
 JBM: in all honesty i haven't checked yet
 inoryy: that way you're not wasting compute on apache
 JBM: but i *hope* most my traffic is over ssl
 JBM: then again i'm fine giving the private keys to iptables
 JBM: but double de-ssl vs apache grep... not sure
 inoryy: I mean if you don't expect a lot of traffic then maybe doing it on apache level is also reasonable
 inoryy: haven't touched it in 10 years so can't say how to proceed though
 JBM: my gut feeling is trigger at apache level, filter at iptables
 JBM: (maintain tables' length with cron)
 Andriamanitra: spent 4 minutes golfing my clash solution before realizing it's fastest mode :sweat_smile:
 Counterbalance: jbm might want to check out fail2ban
 JBM: that's all the fewer minutes you'll need next time
 JBM: yeah i know the name
 JBM: i just never consciously associated it with apache
 JBM: i saw it as a login (say ssh) thing
 Counterbalance: it can also ban IPs that do apache php requests
 Counterbalance: any ban ips for anything it can find in any log.. It's a PITA to customise though, I only use it for ssh
 JBM: well i do get a lot in my ssh logs, but i don't browse them quite as much
 BurakParlak: hi
 _Akira_: hi
 JBM: hi
 Zorsal: Hi, I'm doing temperatures puzzle and I thought about using abs() but it doesn't recognize "abs()" even if math library is imported
 JBM: try using another programming language
 Zorsal: it works with c++ 
 JBM: so what's the problem?
 Zorsal: Originally I wanted to use java, not being able to use abs confused me, I wonder why it works with c++ but not in java even if it's exactly the same in both
 Counterbalance: Math.abs()
 jjhiggz: I just discovered this website, its pretty great
 jjhiggz: I feel like I can dump alot of time into coding and genuinely just be having fun
 itzblinkzy: yea this website is amazing
 itzblinkzy: found it around last week
 itzblinkzy: im really developing my skills here
 Laminator: It's definitely  one of my favorite hobbies right now. And I've used a lot of the techniques I've learned at my job already so I feel really good about investing the time. 
 Laminator: Allis I know you wanna share your code 
 itzblinkzy: When people don't share their code it makes me sad
 itzblinkzy: :cry:
 itzblinkzy: Sometimes i find a hard question i couldnt solve and looking at how others solved it is beneficial to me learning
 Zorsal: when you finally solve the errors but the platform says the code is not optimized enough to handle some cases&#160;:)

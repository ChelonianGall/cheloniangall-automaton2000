 flipped_a_bit: haha using rust instead of python lets me avoid some of the optimizations that the puzzles expect to need in order to pass the time limit
 BartholomewIII: Hey! Rude...
 BartholomewIII: (not that big of a deal)
 Daxlo: @flipped Because Rust runs way faster than Python?
 BartholomewIII: yeah, pretty much
 ZXC01: hi
 ZXC01: can anyone help
 ZXC01: when should i use sheild command in mad pod racing silver league???
 Uljahn: you shouldn't, but you may
 ZXC01: you mean i shouldnt use it?
 programX: hihik
 ZXC01: hi
 Uljahn: i mean in silver you can skip using shield
 ZXC01: ok thanks
 Uljahn: guess you can use it when the angle to the next checkpoint is larger than 90 + 3 * 18, so you won't use thrust in 3 turns either way
 ZXC01: oh thanks!

 ZXC01: i cant win.....
 Uljahn: it happens a lot
 ZXC01: :cry:
 5DN1L: Have you checked how many spaces you have printed before the thrust if thrust = 0 or thrust = 2?

 Uljahn: trust = str(100) will never be reached, fix it
 ZXC01: why?
 ZXC01: so change it to 99?
 Uljahn: hmm nvm
 Thorcode: bruh
 Uljahn: next boost will be equal to thrust 100
 ZXC01: but only one boost what......
 Uljahn: ye, the first boost has an effect of 650, and the next is just 100
 ZXC01: hmm 
 ZXC01: how should i change it then???
 5DN1L: trust is 0. if condition 1/2/3 is met, trust is changed. else if trust &lt; 80... but trust must always be &lt; 80 because trust is 0 if conditions 1/2/3 are not met.
 Uljahn: ^
 ZXC01: erm lemme think...
 ZXC01: so change to:

 ZXC01: wait oh i understand
 BartholomewIII: Thanks 5DN1L for the link, btw
 5DN1L: You're welcome&#160;:)
 Thorcode: pls help me
 BartholomewIII: In python: int(f"{num:b}")
 BartholomewIII: *without the int
 Thorcode: bin(n).replace("0b", "")
 Thorcode: it was this&#160;:(
 vaeng: Are there any stats for the clashes? I would be interested what languages are most often the winners at shortest and fasted and their percentages
 ZXC01: so should i just use boost at the start???
 Thorcode: no
 ZXC01: erm......
 ZXC01: then howwwwwwwwwwwwww
 Thorcode: you should figure out it yourself
 ZXC01: :sob:
 SergeyShirokov: Why does Spring Challenge 2021 include "Graphs"? Isn't it straight up easier to just go with axial coords? Do you really want to use graphs there anywhere except the states graph in minmax?
 Thorcode: Automaton2000 will you join Spring Challenge?
 Automaton2000: i remember i had a bug in my code...
 Thorcode: AutomatonNN will you fight with Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i think it's too much
 Uljahn: SergeyShirokov: i guess it might be convenient to represent the game grid as a graph, you could use bitboards though but it is kinda advanced approach
 Thorcode: Automaton2000 Is Thorcode is a noob?
 Automaton2000: i find it hard to think of it as a loss
 Thorcode: Automaton2000 do you want to be banned?
 Automaton2000: do you think it's a little bit of experience
 Thorcode: why Automaton2000 can answer so quick
 Automaton2000: i spent way too much time on this one :d
 AstroChap: lessgoooooo clash of code
 AstroChap: cracked
 LelouchVC2: cracked in the ass bro
 LelouchVC2: so good
 SergeyShirokov: Uljahn: maybe it's a bit above my understanding, but are there any benefits of using the graph? Like, first thing I did there is converted everything to axial and it's a bit easier to work with directions (distances from point are easy with both approaches, I think)
 Thorcode: Automaton2000 beat me
 Automaton2000: i hate the fact that the map is symmetric

 Thorcode: ZXC01 try another puzzle
 ZXC01: ..........
 BartholomewIII: Or at least take a break and come back to it. If we gave the answers instantly, you wouldn't learn as well.

 noobestnoob: yeah battle royal would be nice
 AntiSquid: how would that work&#160;??

 AntiSquid: you execute someone each time you win? because that's what battle royale is
 AntiSquid: BlaiseVonEbuthIV would CG need to provide / pay for your weapons of choice?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Already has 9mm. :3
 AntiSquid: would take an extra weapon if it was for free?
 AntiSquid: with CG logo on it ofc, maybe clash logo too

 eulerscheZahl: optimize for touchdowns in game?
 eulerscheZahl: technically: of course it's doable
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if interesting, as you know I usually skip the physics games
 jacek: so do i
 struct: would it be that different from SR?
 eulerscheZahl: you can pick your own ball (next checkpoint)
 eulerscheZahl: but probably it would result in reusing most of the code
 jacek: just a loose thought. just like search race is solo csb, the optim would be solo br2k

 n0b1e: thanks jacek yes its that one
 n0b1e: have been stuck for a while now
 jacek: have you read the forum
 darkhorse64: use 64 bit integer for calcculation. Other tip: brute force does not work
 jacek: oO
 n0b1e: thanks for the tip much appreciated and jacek yes i have checked it out thanks
 jacek: of course someone named 64 would recommend using 64bit
 Westicles: I used __int128_t
 GamingGnawer: so... brutefocing didn't work.. but I guess you already figured that out&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: 32 is so last millenium
 darkhorse64: the forum gives so many hints it spoils the puzzle
 n0b1e: thanks a lot tbh i tried to stay away from forums for that reason lol
 n0b1e: i think i got it
 GamingGnawer: Great!I wanted to try something cheeky by pre-computing chunks and making a shorcuts for the brute force algorithm.,,
 GamingGnawer: But i could only do about 10 000 000 per run, target to reach i around....4611686018427387904
 GamingGnawer: so that was a Baaad idea ;P
 n0b1e: haha yeah tried something along those lines too ended miserably :D

 n0b1e: yep true thanks for the input struct

 Codyz: help me solve this puzzle
 struct: have you checked the hints?
 nullaf: right
 WolfChen: Hello, I wonder that is there a command to print a log in codingame?
 WolfChen: Such as console.log
 struct: yes there is
 struct: console.error
 struct: it will still show in ide though
 struct: but it wont make illegal outputs
 WolfChen: Thank you, let me give it a try
 intellagent: java is such a terrible language for coding competitions. 20 lines of java == 3 lines of python
 intellagent: this is a fantastic site, found a gold mine. it actually makes coding fun!
 asioud: it keeps saying "SyntaxError: invalid non-printable character U+00AD" and i dont get why
 asioud: anyone know the cause?
 struct: what are you tring to print?
 asioud: if v_speed ­­­­­&gt; -35:
 asioud: the mars lander episode 2 if you know it
 Thorcode: bruh
 asioud: is it obvious?
 struct: There is nothing wrong on that code
 Thorcode: I will not print that in mars lander ep 2
 asioud: struct do u have a discord i can show u the code
 struct: send it on pm or something
 Thorcode: asioud shall we solved that puzzle together
 asioud: lmao
 asioud: solved it already
 Thorcode: wow
 Avocari: So one question:
 Avocari: Game information: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8b70907-b1d8-4565-b8e1-6166d72013a9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8b70907-b1d8-4565-b8e1-6166d72013a9</a>
 struct: maybe the validator is slightly different
 Thorcode: or this is not the last test case?
 Avocari: it is
 Avocari: after 10 runs with same result I now finally got it ^^
 Wontonimo: W :O W
 n0b1e: hi anyone know how to convert an interger to base 9, but with no 0s using python3? 
 n0b1e:  i have a long way but would like a more condensed solution
 Wontonimo: with no zeros?
 Wontonimo: like, using a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i&#160;?
 struct: does 0 equal 1, 1 equal 2 and so on?
 Wontonimo: so weird
 struct: sounds like a clash
 Wontonimo: how do you print 7 + 2&#160;?
 Wontonimo: 1?
 Wontonimo: no, definitely base 9 comes up a lot in financial transactions in Germany but the whole "no zero" thing seems more like Brazil.
 struct: guess we will never know
 Wontonimo: :thinking:
 Wontonimo: the practical applications are endless
 Thorcode: what is base 9
 struct: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
 Thorcode: thanks
 Thorcode: print 30-21?
 struct: so base 10 9 == 10 on base 9
 Thorcode: really
 struct: well you can check it yourself to confirm

 n0b1e: yeah sorry for late response but base 9 with no zeros. like a function translates n into base 9 with its digits 1-9
 n0b1e: its a part of a  solution for a puzzle here im just looking to optimize 
 n0b1e: so normal base 9 is 0-8 but i want 1-9 if that makes sense
 IndecisionTree: Sounds like the puzzle of the week
 n0b1e: yep
 n0b1e: it is
 n0b1e: i have a long code for it and i want to condense, any tips
 IndecisionTree: No idea. I just solved it too, but by just mimicing the test patterns. I dont understand the reason behind the actual solutions.
 n0b1e: ah I see, it seems by working with base 9 and 10 i can get a solution v similar to test cases
 IndecisionTree: Also, you can check the 'solutions' tab if you've solved it already to see other people's more elegant solutions
 n0b1e: Okay sounds good
 OofButBetter: :taco::bellhop:

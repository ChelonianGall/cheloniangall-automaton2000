 eulerscheZahl: you see me confused TBali
 TBali: why?
 eulerscheZahl: because of the 700 lines
 TBali: check it out&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: then you have a look at mine
 eulerscheZahl: ah, you include all languages there
 TBali: let me see....Okay, but I took the approach to the  extreme
 TBali: missing command lines for 2 langs.
 TBali: 8 langs have error, despite the code works if submitted directly
 TBali: don't know why
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't really take it to the extreme. you have different solutions for each language
 TBali: can be used as a systax cheat sheet for an unknown language 
 eulerscheZahl: while you should only have 1 solution in 1 language and call that from the others
 TBali: I don't know the system() syntax for all 27 languages

 MSmits: beamsearch question
 MSmits: is it possible to get a worse result with a greater beamwidth?
 MSmits: keeping everything else the same
 1400179: Whynot
 MSmits: not sure, it seems counterintuitive somehow, it's a deterministic search and you're improving something
 MSmits: but i think it could be, it's just weird
 1400179: You could be bumping out the good results with fleetingly better ones coming from more expansions
 MSmits: yeah thats it i think
 MSmits: I was just worried i bugged something
 1400179: You prune violently you get violent results
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: maybe time to put some hashing in there, get rid of duplicates
 kovi: that is definitely better than widening
 MSmits: well it depends a lot on how common duplicates are 
 MSmits: not entirey sure yet
 MSmits: entirely
 MSmits: i guess with code of the ring it is at least the case that every game state can be mirrored horizontally, so there's a factor of 2 right there
 MSmits: you can also rotate them 30 times, but i am not sure if rotation states occur much
 MSmits: that's just the symmetry part, then there's also arriving at the same state via a different order of actions. No idea how common that is
 MSmits: and i just shrunk my state-size and increased beamwidth even further. Maybe that helps :P
 ErrorRazor: Chat keeps disconnecting&#160;:|
 ErrorRazor: So uhh how many searches would a decent MCTS algo run in 100ms, in UTTT?
 struct: you need around 25k to reach legend
 struct: with vanilla mcts
 struct: 25k rollouts
 ErrorRazor: Oh shit lol
 MSmits: if you're new to this sort of thing, it's not easy to reach with a language slower than c+=
 MSmits: c++
 MSmits: with c++ it's quite easy
 MSmits: as 100k is also possible
 MSmits: with languages like java and C# and the like, you probably wont be able to do better than 30k or so
 MSmits: and that's if you do it perfectly
 ErrorRazor: I'm using c++ but clearly not doing it well, I get a few hundreds
 jacek: do you have optimisation pragmas?
 ErrorRazor: No what are those
 jacek: #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast,omit-frame-pointer,inline,unroll-loops"
 ErrorRazor: I just started learning tbh
 jacek: write those at top
 ErrorRazor: Ok thx
 MSmits: should help, but will not solve the problem fully
 jacek: secondly, do you use bitboards
 MSmits: probably a factor of 3 at most
 ErrorRazor: No, don't know what those are either
 jacek: no wonder its slow :v
 MSmits: he might also be doing mcts wrong. I noticed many players at first, create nodes all the way to the end game instead of rolling out randomly and only making 1 leaf
 jacek: or they do flat monte carlo thinkig its mcts
 MSmits: yeah but that should at least be fasrt
 MSmits: fast
 ErrorRazor: That's possible, I don't really know what I'm doing :P
 MSmits: thats fine, we didnt either at first
 MSmits: well except jacek, he was born like this
 jrke: so amazons in contribution
 MSmits: cool
 jacek: oh my
 MSmits: remember the other day jacek when you told us your first word was: mmmam... mi.... minimax
 jacek: oO
 jacek: are you high MSmits
 MSmits: how would I know?
 struct: If I have to increase turn time I will do it
 struct: I have no idea
 MSmits: what is it now?
 struct: 100
 jacek: years?
 struct: should be enough for python
 MSmits: well  with so much branching, i would not be surprised to see some reasonable python heuristic bots&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: a challenge for field 3
 MSmits: is there any way to turn off the language assist?
 MSmits: it annoys me
 MSmits: there should be a profile setting for it
 MSmits: account setting i mean, whatever it's called
 1400179: I don't know why people hate it so much, I find it quite useful
 MSmits: well I guess when you're actually using the IDE it's useful, but if you're working locally and paste it in and it tells you: "Fix your :poop: " it's not&#160;:)
 1400179: Locally and paste well there's your problem, you paste
 MSmits: I paste
 MSmits: I don't have a fancy program to send my code =/
 Counterbalance: I fix my :poop: locally and then paste
 MSmits: Counterbalance!
 MSmits: hi
 Counterbalance: heyy
 MSmits: everything good?
 Counterbalance: Yup! Not much time for CG these days unfortunately.. and you?
 MSmits: fine, teaching from home ofc. Plenty of time for CG
 Counterbalance: what are you working on now?
 jrke: for me "learning from home ofc. Plenty of time for CG"&#160;;)
 MSmits: i have to go to school every thursday because somehow the exam classes have to be at school
 MSmits: code of the rings 
 Counterbalance: ah of course you beat me at that too&#160;;)
 MSmits: i was actually 54th doing every validator by hand :P
 MSmits: only just now working on a search
 MSmits: dunno why i didnt start with that right away, would have been much easier
 Counterbalance: maybe, but doing it by hand first must have given you some good ideas
 MSmits: yeah i guess it does give you a feeling for what moves could be good and that helps with pruning
 jrke: looks all bugs fixed in D&amp;B endgame solver but timeout bug is .....
 MSmits: timeout bug?
 jrke: takes 100ms if total no. of chains &gt; 12
 jrke: more than 100ms*
 MSmits: ah thats not really a bug though
 MSmits: i thought you meant something server side
 MSmits: jrke do you have a function that calculates the board value when the board is simple?
 MSmits: like, only isolated chains and loops?
 MSmits: you can do this without search
 MSmits: it's just a calculation
 MSmits: so i mean with 0 joints remaining
 MSmits: I got this from the papers on simple loony endgames
 MSmits: it's useful as part of a greater search, because when you get deeper, you eventually will hit a simple state. Then you finish it off without branching, using a simple calculation
 jrke: hmm
 jrke: MS is choosing smallest loop and pruning bigger loops always is good or not?
 struct: MSmits do you know why some people use _m128 to store bitboards instead of _int128?
 struct: Is it more efficient?
 struct: __m128*
 1400179: __int128 is not standard at all
 struct: I see, is that the main reason?
 1400179: It doesn't map to any register either so it's pointless
 soyreda: anyone want to team up for the hash code competition by google&#160;? 
 ItZAtomic: Doing this has made me realize how bad I am at math. 
 MSmits: _int128 isnt even supported in VS
 MSmits: if i need 128 bit i will just create a struct of two 64 bit or something
 jacek: doing bitboards for amazons?
 jacek: my nn got random loss and couldnt converge. stupid c++. most of the time it initialized with zeroes, but sometimes some values were random memory trash 
 struct: what game jacek?
 jacek: just my own 'framework'. decided to rewrite it
 jacek: easy fix
 MSmits: array[X] = { 0}&#160;?
 jacek: momentumHidden = new float[hidden * SQ * units]; to momentumHidden = new float[hidden * SQ * units]();
 MSmits: your nn is pretty secretive
 MSmits: 4x hidden on 1 line
 MSmits: or 2
 jrke: a stupid ques - is NN a kinda hardcoding?
 MSmits: no
 jacek: well the MLP has the hidden later
 jacek: layer
 MSmits: but it does use codesize as a resource jrke
 jacek: maybe more with the friendship extension
 MSmits: jrke, if you think of your typical minimax eval, consisting of a few features that form a linear combination that leads to a score
 MSmits: a nn will have features too, but its hard to say what they are and instead of maybe 5-10 params, you have thousands
 MSmits: and the score takes much longer to compute
 jrke: ok
 MSmits: they train the nn offline to make sure it computes sensible eval scores
 MSmits: given a gamestate
 kovi: and you may run it on mcts not minimax
 MSmits: you can also run it on minimax
 kovi: yeah, i meant alpha0 style
 MSmits: it's just not done, so i guess it must be less effective
 MSmits: ahh ok
 jrke: how to store it on CG in 10k chars?bytes?
 MSmits: 100k chars
 MSmits: they use floats, possibly 16 bit ones i think
 jrke: oh yes my bad typos
 MSmits: or maybe some conversion
 MSmits: i dunno
 jacek: for bt i have about 50k weights. each weight is stored as 1 unicode character. its a less resoluted 'float'
 Maxim251: how I can activate set&lt;&gt;&#160;? I have error No template named 'set'; did you mean 'get'?
 struct: include &lt;set&gt;
 jrke: #include &lt;set&gt;
 jacek: c++ errors, so descriptive
 Maxim251: thaks, why set&lt;&gt; is not in std&#160;?
 jacek: it is. you need to include it
 Maxim251: Ow, Ok, thank YOU FOR HELP
 DomiKo: if you are lazy you can use &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
 Maxim251: Yes, I see it long time ago that shortcut, but I forget that I could use it

 1400179: It works :p

 MSmits: if so, then that's good

 MSmits: I'm a little surprised the first line of play I found goes 33 plies into my book though
 MSmits: I was somehow expecting it to play differently
 1400179: There are a lot of moves with only one good answer
 MSmits: yeah that's my experience. 1 or 2, rarely 3
 1400179: So if you enter a line where it's more or less forced
 1400179: I had a version earlier on that had 100% vs you, guess it hit the right line all the time

 kovi: another one bytes the ... recurse
 kovi: well done!
 1400179: Thanks
 Swagboy: Hey, what are you guys/girls playing on?
 1400179: Othello. Was.
 kovi: i try to implement my first mcts
 MSmits: wow, never done it before?
 MSmits: thats cool kovi, let me know if you need anything
 kovi: and i have trouble with some parts
 MSmits: ask away
 kovi: for opponent turn, uct should work on opponent win rate or not?
 1400179: It's like minimax
 MSmits: yeah opponent winrate
 1400179: Either you keep the absolute result and do max/min nodes, or you negate according to player to always maximize
 MSmits: so his wins/visits, assuming you're just backpropagating W/L/D
 1400179: If you minimize though don't forget to negate the exploration
 1400179: It's an upper bound
 jacek: each level should be from current player's persective
 MSmits: thats how it is traditionally done, but what reCurse says works fine
 kovi: thx. looked into many guides and implementations and i think many mixed that up i think
 MSmits: negamax vs minimax
 MSmits: sign errors are the most annoying mcts errors
 jacek: wait till you read about mcts solver
 1400179: There's so much crap on the internet that most tutorials are actually getting something massively wrong
 <b>**jacek runz</b></p><p><img src="/a/54241606493073" /> 1400179: If it's on a medium blog post chances are it's trash
 MSmits: well mostly they work, they're just very inefficient
 MSmits: the stuff i found that is
 jacek: like those on NN from 'scratch'. here you have math that we dont know what it does
 1400179: But they can be massively misleading if you're looking to do something good
 MSmits: true
 jacek: and here's python 2 lines that will download mnist example and make full neural network to train
 1400179: So I usually end up doing the ensemble method
 1400179: Grab multiple articles on the same subject and average out the errors
 1400179: Works well most of the time
 Astrobytes: It's a good technique in most subjects
 1400179: It is
 kovi: my problem is that my depth2 minimax is much better on btso i still think my mcts is bugged
 1400179: Scoring scaling can be a big issue with mcts
 1400179: Unless you're doing the pure rollouts
 kovi: (well depth2 + wise eval)
 kovi: i did pure rollouts
 1400179: Then it's up to sheer luck whether it's actually going to do anything
 kovi: without smart eval
 1400179: Or uttt
 1400179: A game where vanilla mcts works is kind of a black swan event
 kovi: i see. i was going to ask for some
 1400179: uttt
 kovi: thx
 MSmits: kovi, what often works better for me is backpropagating an eval 
 MSmits: not for BT though
 MSmits: but for oware it was very strong, also onitama
 1400179: mcts evals are very tricky
 MSmits: yea
 1400179: Not like minimax at all
 MSmits: what is the difference you think?
 MSmits: I mean i just fit params and see where it takes me
 jacek: if you learn mcts, do pure mcts first. uttt is good for that
 1400179: Serious question?
 MSmits: no i know the difference between the algorithms
 MSmits: i just mean, how does this work out in eval params, combining features etc.
 MSmits: i tried a mcts eval in minimax sometimes
 MSmits: was definitely bad
 1400179: The eval is used for (way too) many things in mcts
 MSmits: you mean guiding and deciding what the best move is, i dont see much else
 1400179: It affects everything from exploration, backpropagation, etc
 kovi: or nonrandom rollout
 1400179: You can only truly reason about it in MAB perspective I think
 1400179: Which I don't think is the case for zero sum games
 MSmits: mab?
 1400179: multi armed bandit
 MSmits: ohh ok
 1400179: Unless you let infinities in I guess
 1400179: But that makes me out
 kovi: one last question about uct...so using current player winrate...and max...but what about the exploration param
 MSmits: for me it often has best value 1.0
 MSmits: that's if you count a loss as -1 and a win as +1
 1400179: It is "determined empirically"
 MSmits: yeah
 1400179: Love those scientific words
 jacek: its usually less than sqrt(2)
 kovi: sorry...i meant the formula not the constant
 1400179: What about it
 kovi: the whole need to be maxed (for current/original player)
 1400179: You can look at it as a measure of uncertainty
 1400179: The more visits you have on a node, the more certain you are
 1400179: So it maximizes the upper bound of average and uncertainty to balance exploration vs exploitation
 MSmits: you iterate over all moves and you select the move that has the highest sum of the exploration term + the exploitation term
 kovi: ok, for my usebut than what someone wrote (here in chat) to use minimum for enemy is incorrect
 MSmits: a higher exploration parameter will make the exploration term more powerful and you end up with lower depth in your search
 1400179: That's why I also said to negate the exploration term if you do minimize
 kovi: ok, understood now
 MSmits: kovi generally most players use maximum for both the player and the opponent. You alternate scores in backpropagation usually
 kovi: i will stick to max
 MSmits: if you do it the way reCurse explained you will not alternate in backpropagation
 1400179: There are pros and cons
 MSmits: but instead negate in selection
 kovi: yeah, either alternate backprop or alternate use
 kovi: thx
 1400179: You can mess up signs in either way
 MSmits: and if you're anything like me, you will mess it up a lot :P
 MSmits: its worse when you add a solver, because you can have more kinds of sign errors then
 1400179: In other news, adding more code creates more bugs
 kovi: my current one seems proper...just weak for bt
 1400179: I think random rollouts are a poorer fit than average for bt
 MSmits: yeah.. the risk is that you will copy your mcts to another game that is slightly different and have multiple erros because of it, that causes a lot of issues with me
 MSmits: random rollouts are also weak in oware
 MSmits: full ones anyway
 kovi: another q: are you reusing the tree on subsequent turns?
 1400179: Preferable
 kovi: yeah, i dont see anything against it other than memory(too bad the long first turn probably gives useless nodes)
 kovi: (long timeout on first turn)
 1400179: 640MB ought to be enough for anyone
 MSmits: kovi i reuse the tree sometimes, but if you use heuristics to prune moves and your opponent makes a different one, you lose it anyway
 MSmits: in uttt i lose my tree a lot because i make assumptions
 kovi: makes sense
 kovi: what amount of rollouts are reasonable...for bt 50ms?(i will probably come back with the same q for uttt later)
 reCurse: No idea, don't think anyone did it
 MSmits: dont know kovi, i dont do random rollouts in bt, i just eval and backpropagate
 kovi: i c
 kovi: thx a lot
 reCurse: It's also a terrible metric for what it's worth
 1400179: But some memes never die
 MSmits: it's better than nothing, in uttt it's good as long as players keep it simple and do nothing but random rollouts
 MSmits: if you start making the rollouts heavy, it starts to be useless
 struct: on some games is needed though
 reCurse: Isn't bt 100ms anyway
 kovi: and how many rollouts per 50ms there?
 MSmits: in uttt it's 100 ms i think, if i remove all heavy stuff i can get up to 130k
 MSmits: in turn 2
 kovi: wow, bt is 100ms as well
 MSmits: currently i get more like 90k
 MSmits: because of heavy pruned expansion and such
 MSmits: and rollout too
 struct: rollout with eval is to stop early right?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: you can also stop at depth 0, so no random at all
 reCurse: 'stop early' makes no sense
 MSmits: that only works if your eval is good
 kovi: pure eval on state
 reCurse: And the :fire: is started
 kovi: like with...nnn
 struct: By stop early I  meant stop before game reaches the end
 MSmits: it makes sense if your eval is bad reCurse. I kept refitting this depth parameter in oware (how deep i rolled out) and as my eval got better, the ideal depth went to 0
 MSmits: thats why its 0 for you as well reCurse, because NN eval is awesome
 MSmits: it was about 4 or 5 at first
 MSmits: so 4-5 random moves, then eval
 MSmits: struct i know
 kovi: interesting
 DomiKo: kovi with full random like 10K rollouts in bt
 kovi: but if you dont do random rollout
 Angecide: what game is bt?
 kovi: isnt minimaxed eval is better?
 DomiKo: Breakthrough
 struct: breakthrough
 kovi: thx domiko
 MSmits: kovi not necessarily, the advantage of doing mcts is that you get deeper on some branches
 kovi: true
 reCurse: But that wasn't my point
 reCurse: I still think it makes no sense
 reCurse: You either do eval or rollout
 reCurse: Mixing both? Why
 Angecide: so you can get more rollouts in 100ms
 reCurse: Then just use eval at leaf
 MSmits: because when you random you get a better sampling. The "badness" of the eval averages out then
 MSmits: hopefully
 reCurse: But the same can be said for mcts
 reCurse: So it's already covered
 MSmits: yes, i think this topic is too complicated for casual conversation though.  All I noticed is that with poorly fitted parameters, it helped to add a few random moves.... dont know how to prove it or put it in to words properly
 reCurse: hocus pocus :wand:
 MSmits: yeah maybe so&#160;:)
 MSmits: but if it helps, i assume for every game now that i dont need the random moves
 MSmits: at the risk of being wrong
 MSmits: never tried random in bt
 MSmits: nor onitama
 MSmits: it just makes coding the searches less work. Coding random rollout efficiently is tricky
 MSmits: even tried a 0 depth uttt rollout + eval. Wasnt even that bad
 MSmits: top 20
 MSmits: you probably like that reCurse, a reasonable uttt bot with no random&#160;:)
 Maxim251: what header file is for c++ contains?
 struct: string
 struct: you want to see if string contains another string right?
 struct: or something else?
 Maxim251: yes
 struct: use str.find(anotherString)
 Maxim251: i remember that i use contains(inout1, input2) but i dont remember what was header for that
 Maxim251: I think I need make my one function "contains"&#160;:/
 1400179: I wish I was kidding but you need to wait for C++23 for that
 struct: doesnt find do the job? Maxim251
 Maxim251: I think Yes, Probably long time ago, probably I was using some private library what was containing compare... I was thinking that this will be in std&#160;:| Yeah well, Is not hard, to do for loop and if statment.&#160;:)
 Maxim251: and output as bool
 MSmits: you're not using c++ in a clash are you?
 Maxim251: no
 MSmits: ah ok good
 MSmits: btw ... automatonNN you dog! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/uiMLcwy">https://imgur.com/a/uiMLcwy</a>
 AutomatonNN: why?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: woof AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: hey guys
 struct: I blame pixi MSmits
 MSmits: no worries, i just think it is funny
 pluto-de: who's number 1 on this site (or how can i check the leaderboard)
 MSmits: activites
 MSmits: compete
 pluto-de: ok ty
 MSmits: it kind of depends what you mean by nr 1 though. The overall nr 1 is part activity part achievement/skill. The best players are not necessarily nr 1.
 MSmits: the nr 1 is quite good though
 MSmits: there are many leaderboards and you can make up your own mind of what you find important
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, tonight no one is side channel hacking my GPU ... well that's good
 struct: what do you mean patrick?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: last time I was on cg, my gpu had an openGL hack thru browser
 PatrickMcGinnisII: drove me crazy for hours trying to track it down
 Orip: is it possible to do recursive function here?
 BrokenMaster_8213: yes
 Orip: how
 Astrobytes: Call your function recursively.
 BrokenMaster_8213: ^dont thats that literally, lol
 BrokenMaster_8213: dont take*
 Orip: i mean
 Orip: how do i do it for the full thing or i must enter it into a func
 struct: int func(int n) {
 struct: infinite recursion
 Astrobytes: 1. We have no idea what you're working on.2. We have no idea why you need a recursive function.3. What 'full thing'?
 Orip: full code
 Orip: but thanks i understand it's impossible
 Astrobytes: No it's not.
 Orip: needed to make a def and then do it
 Orip: RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
 Astrobytes: Yes, you need to make a function outside of the main program loop
 Orip: def naive_ackermann(m,n): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/55470721-f4b6-442c-8dff-be7b15da4d33">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/55470721-f4b6-442c-8dff-be7b15da4d33</a>
 BrokenMaster_8213: you are getting stuck inside your functions, you will have to write a condition to break it
 Orip: nvm
 Orip: this is the erroir
 Orip: RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
 Orip: what can i do?
 Astrobytes: meh, the auto pastebin isn't working, use pastebin.com or something to post your code if you like
 PatrickMcGinnisII: PEBCAK
 Astrobytes: Sounds like you're infinitely recursing
 Orip: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/Yey60Hdk">https://pastebin.com/Yey60Hdk</a>
 Orip: ye
 Orip: ill check my code
 struct: recursion inside recursion
 struct: is  too much for my brain too handle at this hour
 Astrobytes: Yeah what's with that
 Astrobytes: return naive_ackermann(m - 1, naive_ackermann(m, n - 1)) - this could be an issue
 BrokenMaster_8213: that IS the issue :P
 Astrobytes: (no s**t :D )
 BrokenMaster_8213: i think it keeps repeating over and over again becaise m never reaches actual 0, since it recalls itself, never gettis to actually go m - 1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that's a highly exponential # of calls for even small m and n
 Astrobytes: My brain just popped
 ErrorRazor: Same
 BrokenMaster_8213: i mightve looked too fast, but wouldnt you just want to n+1 for the same result? :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gfredericks.com/things/arith/ackermann">https://gfredericks.com/things/arith/ackermann</a>
 ErrorRazor: Looks to me like it would result in 1 rather than n+1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: even with memoization it's a hog
 Astrobytes: Looks like a poor implementation, is it a specific puzzle?
 ErrorRazor: Yeah this animation looks like it'll never end
 BrokenMaster_8213: i think our names just changed to Ackermann
 BrokenMaster_8213: interesting, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gfredericks.com/things/arith/ackermann">https://gfredericks.com/things/arith/ackermann</a>
 Sergen: does anyone know how the coc question algorithm works. Like how it prioritises which questions are chosen or if it's completely random?
 ErrorRazor: Not completely random, it doesn't repeat a puzzle within a short period of time
 gatitos: i jsut did a coc and my thing has been pending for like
 gatitos: 2 minutes
 gatitos: is it stuck
 gatitos: it is taking so long that the clash finished
 mfnsvrtm: same
 gatitos: NVM it finally finnished
 gatitos: test cases were taking forever too 
 pdx_firebird: server is having some issues it would seem
 Youzak: Do you guys often have the issue where a test case may fail or success randomly because of execution time being variable&#160;?
 Youzak: succeed*
 Youzak: Especially tonight where the servers seems to be a bit laggy
 Rodrigo_the_coder: time_of_lag = 'night'console.log(time_of_lag)

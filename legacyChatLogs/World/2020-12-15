 struct: DomiKo I dont  really see any bug on that replay
 mzbear: i'm so fed up with MCTS after Blocking that i'm writing UTTT bot super casually lol ... just heuristics to see which moves lead to immediate guaranteed loss/win
 mzbear: turn timer says 0.025ms per turn on average ... so refreshing :D
 mzbear: it would be funny to have alternative bot boards with ridiculously low time limit ... like 5ms per turn
 struct: mzbear the minimum time sdk allows is 50ms
 struct: per turn
 struct: Also some languages would struggle quite a bit with 5ms
 mzbear: i suppose the platform can't reliably handle managing games that fast, either. any lag would ruin it
 mzbear: oh no, there's no way i can defeat silver UTTT boss with simple heuristics ... do i really have to make a search function :cry:
 struct: Hard to do well on it without a search
 mzbear: i kinda wanna reach gold without a search. just slapping MCTS on this doesn't really feel like a worthy challenge
 struct: Well you can try minimax
 struct: but it performs worse
 mzbear: that's also a type of search
 struct: a didnt read 1st part properly
 struct: Well you can try teccles heuristic
 mzbear: or maybe i should say ... i dont want to build a forward going move tree
 struct: Teccles heuristic is to force opponent
 struct: to play on the same board you just played
 struct: Some people use it on the start of the game
 Westicles: Isn't UTTT the ultimate "fastest mcts wins" contest?
 mzbear: hmmm... well, that's an interesting way to get some moves on the board, but it isn't exactly intuitive whether it's a good idea in the long run.  could be exploitable
 mzbear: westicles, i refuse to believe that!
 struct: Quite a few people on legend use it
 mzbear: i'm sure it would perform quite well, yes
 Westicles: Bitboards required
 mzbear: i'm already doing that
 mzbear: i even got some useless BMI2 usage going on :D
 struct: There is quite a few stuff you can do with MCTS
 struct: Im sure its just not fastest wins
 mzbear: mcts would require quite a bit of tuning, there's no way i'm doing that by hand in the web editor ever again
 mzbear: my heuristic bot still loses to silver boss every time, but at least it manages to fight back a little.  average move time 0.03ms
 mzbear: but that made it play weaker against everyone else in silver.  heh.  i'll need to think a bit before writing code
 mzbear: oh wow, i had typoed a hex constant in one of my BMI2 optimizations, fixed it and suddenly my bot plays much better
 mzbear: it wasn't capable of reading the board correctly ... which boggles the mind, because it still got into silver league
 jacek: bmi2 in uttt? w00t?
 mzbear: it's due to the board representation i'm using
 jacek: also, teccless heuristic is good opening. i added it and managed from top 20 to top 10. at least its good for player 1.
 mzbear: for the global board, instead of separate occupation maps, i use 0 for open, 1 for full/blocked, and then 2/3 for player states. so i can test against 0 to see the subboard is still open
 mzbear: which necessiates _pext_u32(mask,0x15555)&amp;_pext_u32(mask,0x2AAAA) if i want one player's pieces extracted from that
 jacek: :be
 jacek: :thumbsup:
 jacek: do you have other heuristics?
 LightFury01: hey  guys
 mzbear: this thing is ONLY heuristics :D
 RaunakCodes2625: HI
 RaunakCodes2625: WHICH LANGUAGE 
 jacek: oh
 RaunakCodes2625: I AM IN PYTHON
 RaunakCodes2625: U?
 LightFury01: how you guys doing
 LightFury01:&#160;:)
 RaunakCodes2625:&#160;:)
 LightFury01: me c#
 RaunakCodes2625: OO
 Vaibhav0705: ik
 Vaibhav0705: r
 mzbear: i maintain a table of decisive board information, such as which subboards contain immediate local win for each player, and which subboard wins lead to immediate global win for each player
 LightFury01: nada
 mzbear: and with help of those, i can calculate if a move guarantees loss within 2 moves
 mzbear: or if entering a subboard guarantees a loss
 LightFury01:&#160;:)
 mzbear: ohwell, since i just fixed a major bug, time to throw this into arena and see if i can get out of silver league without search algorithm ;D
 Astrobytes: A heuristics-based UTTT bot eh? I don't know whether that's insanity, bravery, or a healthy dose of both! :D
 mzbear: if i get into gold league, i gotta start doing better heuristics
 mzbear: right now i'm only doing fairly absolute calculations.  but they only take 0.024ms per turn
 Astrobytes: I'm guessing you'll definitely need some kind of search if you get out of silver
 mzbear: yea, this plays kinda passively really
 Astrobytes: Your board representation seems nice and fast, shouldn't be any trouble to chuck a MCTS in there
 Westicles: Should be easy to tune in the web editor!
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: neat, MSmits finally submitted oware bot
 mzbear: the core of the bot is iterating through all valid moves, picking one with reservoir sampling, and skipping moves which are guaranteed to lose.  after that it runs another two loops to try to disrupt enemy and to grab subboard wins for itself if it wants them
 Astrobytes: Oh so that's what he's been quietly doing jacek
 mzbear: i'm a bit upset that an earlier buggy version of my bot actually got fairly high in silver league
 jacek: and without the bug its worse?
 mzbear: yep.  except that i seem to win against the boss 100% of the time ... if only i could get to fight it
 Astrobytes: Standard CG bot writing issue right there.
 Astrobytes: Boss is just the gatekeeper, it's the rabid hordes below it you gotta worry about
 mzbear: oh, right, i dont set a random seed so my bot is fully deterministic ... and so is the boss
 mzbear: earlier randomness was happening because i was reading uninitialized memory :D
 Astrobytes: hahaha. Well that's one way to do rng I guess
 niStee: :D
 mzbear: oh great, here we go, now it's losing against the boss every time again ... it was just winning with that one seed ;_;
 mzbear: yeah, this bot sucks.  i just really REALLY dont want to write another MCTS right after Blocking
 Astrobytes: Hey, you picked UTTT :D
 mzbear: i didn't read the full rules of the game first, i thought it was going to be more chill ... but that thing about being sent to a specific subgrid .... argh
 Westicles: I tried to warn him&#160;:)
 Westicles: You could try the optims intstead, they are more fun than the bots
 Astrobytes: Or make a game&#160;;)
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 mzbear: making a game might actually be fun, yes
 Gilad-Gur-Andelman: I think there should be an extra prize for someone who wins shortest mode in JavaScript where the others write in Python
 MSmits: hey jacek
 MSmits: did you see this:

 MSmits: making progress, but not there yet, your bot is so hard to beat&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: morning MSmits :wave:
 5PID3RH7CK3R: hey
 5PID3RH7CK3R: Ho
 5PID3RH7CK3R: Anybody?
 5PID3RH7CK3R: Dead Chat
 5PID3RH7CK3R: F
 5PID3RH7CK3R: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7d4ca4c-ba96-4432-94b0-114e645b000b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7d4ca4c-ba96-4432-94b0-114e645b000b</a>
 5PID3RH7CK3R: OOO noice
 Astrobytes: You want kicked?
 5PID3RH7CK3R: nah
 5PID3RH7CK3R: im just testing
 5PID3RH7CK3R: lol
 Astrobytes: Well stop it then.
 5PID3RH7CK3R: kk
 jacek: 50%? :scream:
 mzbear: oh yeah, sending enemy to play in subboards that cannot contribute to victory anymore seems quite effective in UTTT silver league, wins against the boss half of the time too.  but only got rank 7, mmh mmh mmh 
 MSmits: morning Astrobytes
 MSmits: jacek it is like 70 with you as p2, and 30 with you as p1
 MSmits: your p1 game is really hard to beat
 MSmits: 70 took a long time, but is more doable
 MSmits: (p2 i mean)
 MSmits: think there's an early mistake somewhere in your p2, but hard to be sure
 MSmits: from doing a lot of meta mcts, it does seem like the bot almost does perfect play
 jacek: so if i rewrite the bot to rust, you are dead
 MSmits: nah, i dont need massive cg bench, it would just mean i submit twice a day to get some games
 MSmits: i run cg bench to first loss, analyze the game, adjust meta mcts to search
 MSmits: my bot doesnt make many mistakes either
 MSmits: so i just need to find them
 jacek: nice of you being nonNN at the top
 Astrobytes: that was the objective iirc&#160;;)
 MSmits: without book it's a clear 5th
 MSmits: big gap on both sideesw
 MSmits: sides
 jacek: big gap between top 5 and rest
 MSmits: yes and big gap between 4 and 5 i think, well depending on submit
 MSmits: sometimes i would get near 4, but i think it's lucky
 MSmits: btw agade has a weird bot
 jacek: and scary avatar
 MSmits: one move in some cases is difference between 0% and 100% winrate
 pu55ython: titties
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: sometimes i am adjusting my meta mcts vs you, and my agade drops hard
 MSmits: because it's super deterministiv
 MSmits: +c
 MSmits: basically means finding a new playline vs agade
 MSmits: pretty easy because it always plays the same moves
 MSmits: he should do the +random thing
 MSmits: so should robo, also pretty easy, but his playline does not compete with yours so it doesnt change
 MSmits: btw if you were wondering:
 MSmits: Moves Added: 1473
 MSmits: that's all 
 MSmits: room for 100k more :P
 MSmits: i think i run out of HD space before i run out of book space
 jacek: how deep it is
 VizGhar: What are you 2 talking about? You should probably open closed chat&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Nah, this is the daily sermon from MSmits
 Astrobytes: (well, used to be daily&#160;;) )
 VizGhar: :D good to know
 MSmits: it depends jacek. Some cases 90 plies, on your p2 line. The thing is, even though you often have 4 moves to choose from, 3 moves are so bad that no bot will pick them anyway. So branching is effectively 1
 MSmits: VizGhar dont interrupt the sermon&#160;! :P
 jacek: do you have more gray hair now?
 MSmits: mmh not really, less hair maybe
 VizGhar: ok, ok... jeez... :D
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8063c879-ea5f-4e7b-a2aa-592d5169909d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8063c879-ea5f-4e7b-a2aa-592d5169909d</a>
 MSmits: the interesting thing is that many consistently won games go 200 plies deep, but i just need a  little help preventing mistakes in the first 20 to 40 plies
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: Smits is master of opening books and Destroyer of NNs
 MSmits: I try :P
 MSmits: yes this guy is like me jacek
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: so my school is closed till 19 jan =/
 MSmits: lockdown
 MSmits: will be doing a lot of online teaching again
 Astrobytes: Ah. Well, better for your health prospects I guess.
 MSmits: yeah, i have some colleagues who caught it
 Astrobytes: Also, more CG time :smiling_imp:
 MSmits: that for sure, i just got out of a very busy work/study period
 Astrobytes: Ah crap, I hope they've recovered well
 MSmits: i think so, 1 still sick but i expect he will be ok
 MSmits: I have to create a game and game design document for a class (as a student)
 Astrobytes: Was just gonna ask about your studies
 MSmits: I was thinking of recreating yavalath in unity and add some features for improving play
 MSmits: like hints and such like they have for chess games
 Astrobytes: Nice idea!
 MSmits: its better than the alternative, they wanted me to try and create a variation of the roll a ball tutorial
 MSmits: but that seems boring
 Astrobytes: Why stop there though. Ultimate Yavalath. Many boards. Many dimensions :P
 Astrobytes: That seems excruciatingly boring tbh
 MSmits: sure i might do some other variation
 jacek: roll a ball?
 MSmits: its a basic unity tutorial
 MSmits: move a ball, gather coins 
 jacek: variation would be roll a cube
 MSmits: pretty good as a tutorial, but not very motivating to work on
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: haha
 Astrobytes: roll a ball, every time you grab a coin a Yavalath board pops up
 MSmits: good one
 MSmits: but i am allowed to just create a different game
 MSmits: they wanted to make it easier for since it is only a  3 credit course
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'd go with your idea. Won't take you long, you can spend more time polishing it
 MSmits: yeah, btw, i think you can even sell a yavalath game as long as you dont call it that
 MSmits: the name is trademarked
 Astrobytes: Lavayath. Just add a volcano somewhere.
 MSmits: you cant copyright simple game mechanics apparently
 MSmits: brilliant
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: maybe in the middle, it's a solved move anyway
 Astrobytes: Good idea!
 MSmits: might have to increase the size of the board, because it might cause a lot of draws, maybe not though
 MSmits: btw
 MSmits: i did the playground tensorflow thing
 Astrobytes: Have to test it first. Either that or you could just make the whole board lava, pieces jump around on rocks
 MSmits: for my course at work
 Astrobytes: ah right, how did that go
 MSmits: cut it into little pieces and slowly grew the app to teach them about NN
 MSmits: it worked great
 MSmits: much better than i thought it would, it's really a nice thing they made
 jacek: playground? you mean that graphic thing?
 Astrobytes: Awesome. Your students responded well to it?
 MSmits: its especially cool how you can solve some problems with more input and also with more hidden layers
 MSmits: jacek yeah
 Astrobytes: brb, need coffee
 Uljahn: did you use specific dataset?
 Uljahn: like MNIST
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://playground.tensorflow.org/">https://playground.tensorflow.org/</a>
 MSmits: all 4 data classification sets
 MSmits: the spiral can only be done with hidden layers
 Uljahn: ah, that thing
 MSmits: you dont even need to be able to code to learn about NN
 MSmits: in depth even, because it really shows what hidden layers do
 jacek: the pinnacle of machine learning - throw new more hidden layers and see what happends
 MSmits: yeah, it also shows that if you throw in too many, your nn wont converge in any reasonable time
 MSmits: kinda gives you a feel for the kind of thing researches deal with
 MSmits: the trial and error
 MSmits: still feel a bit lacking in knowledge because I havent made my own NN yet, but it's good enough to teach these basic things
 jacek: it really kicked when i saw xor example in python, then rewritten to withtout numpy, then rewritten to c++
 jacek: with 1 hidden layer and arbitrary hidden nodes
 jacek: thats why im strill struggling with convolutional NNs. i could simply do complicated architecture in python using lib, but to understand it fully i'd have to write it myself from scratch
 Astrobytes: well, experience is a great teacher
 MSmits: yeah
 ian173: miss me with that poorly written coding question
 jacek: hm?
 Lks10: which game you all talking about?
 jacek: oware
 SupSon: oware uses nn?
 Astrobytes: several of the top AIs yeah
 jacek: except for the 3rd
 jacek: ;f
 Astrobytes: indeed
 SupSon: tensorflow?
 darkhorse64: I am looking for N-tuple reference (either toy implementation or paper for noob). Any pointers
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 jacek: this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.108.5111&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.108.5111&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>
 jacek: SupSon there are no NN libs for python in CG. 
 MSmits: is it fair to say there are no NN libs in CG?
 MSmits: at all?
 jacek: maybe
 darkhorse64: I read this one but it does not really describe what is a N-tuple or I did not understand
 darkhorse64: Thanks anyway
 MSmits: a ntuple is a pattern with a parameter
 MSmits: when you eval you check for patterns on your board
 MSmits: N stands for the number of squares
 MSmits: or hexes or whatever
 MSmits: in othello you can go up to 9 or so
 MSmits: because there are so many possible patterns, you get a huge load of params, which you train 
 MSmits: using TD learning for example
 jacek: well i know several papers of using N-tuples, dunno if they are more explanable
 MSmits: darkhorse64, basically, you create a giant lookup array
 MSmits: you pext your board to extract sets of patterns for features
 MSmits: then do the lookups and calculate your eval by adding them up linearly
 MSmits: correct me if i am wrong jacek
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf">http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/pub/papers/Szubert2014_2048.pdf</a>  for 2048, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6932907">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6932907</a> for connect4
 jacek: basically its correct, MSmits
 MSmits: thought so, all this seems easy to me, it's mostly the learning I am vague about
 SupSon: do you use frugally deep?
 MSmits: whats that?
 jacek: so, no&#160;:)
 jacek: i googled its some c++ nn lib
 DomiKo: :joy:
 SupSon: how do you encode the state of the board?
 MSmits: for othello it's easy, 64 squares
 darkhorse64: I have read all of that by googling this afternoon but I do not seem to be able to connect all the dots together. How to extract the pattern across the board, how to train, what are the relevant data structures&#160;? Actually most papers require some prior knowledge that I haven't yet
 MSmits: 1 bit each
 MSmits: two boards
 MSmits: darkhorse, use pext to extract
 SupSon: no for oware
 MSmits: did you use pext for yavalath darkhorse64?
 MSmits: it's the same thing
 jacek: i use 12 ints for houses and 2 ints for score
 SupSon: oh so not one hot?
 MSmits: SupSon i use a single uint64_t for the entire board
 Astrobytes: ('cause he's nuts)
 SupSon: for input to the nn?
 jacek: SupSon oh you meant the input for the NN?
 MSmits: Astrobytes yes :P
 SupSon: yea input to the nn 
 MSmits: darkhorse64, this might help:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48394866/how-to-replicate-pext-parallel-bit-extract-with-basic-bitwise-ops">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48394866/how-to-replicate-pext-parallel-bit-extract-with-basic-bitwise-ops</a>
 jacek: then yes, i use one-hots. each house has 1 possible state of 0-31 and each score also is 1 possible state of 0-25
 MSmits: or <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/pext">https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/pext</a>
 darkhorse64: I know pext, the real issue is the mask (I mean which data to extract)
 jacek: so i have always active 14 inputs out of possible 436 inputs at any given time
 MSmits: ohh that depends on the game
 MSmits: Othello uses mostly patterns connected to the corners
 MSmits: like 3x2
 MSmits: or 3x3
 RoboStac: I just directly pass 16 floats in for my nn - 12 for the houses, 2 for the scores and 2 0's so my input layer is a multiple of 8
 MSmits: so you extract those bits and look them up
 MSmits: hi robo&#160;:)
 RoboStac: hi
 SupSon: alright thanks
 MSmits: RoboStac, if you want to beat my bot again in oware, add some random to your move selection
 MSmits: +0.01 or something
 MSmits: might also help beat other NN's if your bot is strong enough
 RoboStac: I'm not sure how much difference that'd make, it's usually very certain on the value of a move
 MSmits: I'm just solving your entire playline now =/
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: but the game is long
 MSmits: you say usually, but that's 100 choices or so
 MSmits: it only takes some variation to frustrate a booker
 MSmits: just an idea, make it a little harder for me
 Astrobytes: wait for the chess game, you'll love that MSmits :P
 MSmits: your bot is otherwise very very strong
 jacek: but its 960
 Astrobytes: exactly
 MSmits: whats that?
 Astrobytes: "love" it
 MSmits: 960?
 Astrobytes: Fischer Random
 MSmits: ohh ok
 RoboStac: a chess variation designed to beat opening books
 MSmits: nice
 RoboStac: 960 starting layouts
 MSmits: i would not mind more games i cant book, there's too many games to book as it is. I only have so many cpus :P
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: still have to do checkers and breakthrough
 MSmits: havent started on those
 MSmits: i kinda want to improve bot before i do
 Astrobytes: too busy with raic for cg atm
 MSmits: meta mcts sucks with bad bot
 MSmits: ah hows that going
 jacek: not if you allocated enough time for mcts...
 Astrobytes: Pretty good, qualified for round 2 at least
 MSmits: nice
 Astrobytes: game is pretty cool
 MSmits: jacek thats true, but it would go off on a bad branch for days. Better to avoid that. Also helps to have a strong solver to detect early loss/win
 Westicles: there is this libtensorflowlite_c-linux64.so
 Westicles: Looks like it is for dart...
 jacek: oO
 Westicles: and also rust
 RoboStac: MSmits - looks like you were right, a little randomness does beat your opening book
 jacek: :scream:

 MSmits: ah ok, yeah it does
 LastRick: Oh wow. Zigzag? Very impressive.
 LastRick: BTW I just solved it, found the problem was I was using the cat's current location to solve where on the pool edge I should go, rather than the cat's location on the NEXT step. That literally was the difference.

 WillRises: Right I got that. I just don't know how to apply that in the (terminal?).
 MSmits: allright, I assume you know the current location of batman
 MSmits: if the input says the bomb is to the right
 Astrobytes: in the Bat Cave
 MSmits: you take the currentX 
 MSmits: and the maximum X
 Astrobytes: just off the phone with him
 LastRick: Hah
 MSmits: and go between them. Just average them
 jacek: or maybe hes asking how does input/output work on CG
 YusufEmad04: print("Hello World")
 MSmits: input works as reading input for your language, depends
 WillRises: Hmm I might be learning how to run a marathon here before learning to crawl
 MSmits: output is basically just your languages print statement
 DomiKo: hi struct
 MSmits: you might be a talented baby, who knows
 struct: hi DomiKo
 DomiKo: You know you got bug too?
 struct: WillRises you might want to start with easy puzzles
 struct: DomiKo which bug?
 DomiKo: in STC
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are in top20 already :o
 WillRises: struct. got any suggestions on "easy puzzles"?
 eulerscheZahl: i think you should stop now
 struct: I saw the replay, but no bug
 MSmits: some easy puzzles are harder than batman though, they're not all categorized properly
 DomiKo: euler yea 
 DomiKo: top20 is hard no
 DomiKo: the gap is so biggg
 struct: do the decent, power of thor, horse racing, temperatures
 MSmits: the descent
 WillRises: Word. Thanks.
 MSmits: those are quite good yeah
 eulerscheZahl: do the descent decently
 struct: DomiKo what was the bug?&#160;:|
 MSmits: also dont give up when you fail the first one
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 eulerscheZahl: :door:
 MSmits: some might suit you better
 WillRises: Never give up. Never surrender
 DomiKo: the bug is losing :wink:
 MSmits: right
 struct: oh
 MSmits: jacek it's still on my list. Maybe if you didnt make your bots so strong in other games, i'd already be doing the soccer game&#160;:)
 struct: Maybe when I finish STC that bug is fixed
 LastRick: All of the easy puzzles are definitely not created equally. "Easy", "Medium", even "Very Hard", these are subjective terms not defined by, say, a dictionary.
 eulerscheZahl: is STC on your list too smits?
 MSmits: smash the code?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: i did start it once, but never finished the bot
 MSmits: something happened, probably a contest or a fun multi
 Westicles: RIP another rockstar
 MSmits: i also still need to finish my D&amp;B
 eulerscheZahl: they are dying like flies
 LastRick: rockstar is (was?) a user, correct?
 Westicles: ya
 eulerscheZahl: i have 5 now unnamed followers in the last 3 weeks
 eulerscheZahl: i think that was all rockstar
 MSmits: what are you doing to them?
 eulerscheZahl: ban
 LastRick: what is going on? 
 eulerscheZahl: long story
 LastRick: ahh
 LastRick: how can there be so much drama on a site full of nerds coding pods
 Westicles: I made a nice clash for him... oh well
 MSmits: there's not that much drama i think, considering this chat is almost completely open
 mzztin: poggers
 MSmits: problem is mostly that teachers have their class login here and do stuff
 MSmits: which is cool, but problematic sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: there's a much bigger drama event in the coding world: hacktoberfest
 eulerscheZahl: imagine it like a school class released on the CG chat. but instead of 1h it lasts an entire month
 MSmits: fun
 YusufEmad04: hi
 eulerscheZahl: nonsense pull requests just so you complete 5 PRs and get a free tshirt
 MSmits: maybe I am immature but sometimes their jokes make me laugh. 
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 LastRick: had no idea about the classroom assignment stuff. But it makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: some teachers park their class here. which is fine as long as they are supervised
 LastRick: hahah
 MSmits: I've only rarely  had specific students come online here, not just whole classes
 MSmits: it just doesnt work, most students cant code well enough, so they'll just mess around
 eulerscheZahl: ramdeath has better students than you
 LastRick: i'll say this. I enjoy the chat and site more during this time of day rather than, say, eight hours from now. Totally different.
 MSmits: no doubt, different kind of class I bet
 eulerscheZahl: in 8h Europe is asleep
 MSmits: LastRick it's not the same every day though
 MSmits: but i get your point
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl is asleep
 MSmits: not all of us
 eulerscheZahl: :P
 MSmits: well... we *should* be
 Astrobytes: Smits is up all night cooing softly to his meta MCTSs
 MSmits: but I doubt i'll sleep early these next few weeks
 MSmits: huh
 MSmits: i thought all my cameras were off
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: did MadKnight tell you this, he's always hacking me
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: ohh i got kicked off nr 1 othello
 MSmits: some guy named oldjohn evaded my book
 MSmits: mmhh
 Westicles: easy come, easy iago
 MSmits: he beats dbdr sometimes too
 struct: 40 moves book lol
 Astrobytes: jeez westicles that was awful
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/516146459">https://www.codingame.com/replay/516146459</a>
 Astrobytes: :D
 Westicles: heh heh
 MSmits: struct that is going to make it really easy to fix for me
 struct: yeah
 LastRick: Westicles: :neutral_face:
 MSmits: well I'll get on that then
 mzbear: rewrote my heuristic engine, misplaced one&#160;! and it took forever to find the issue, argh
 MSmits: happened to all of us
 MSmits: sucks
 MSmits: sometimes i just place a&#160;! because I am really excited about my code without meaning to negate it
 mzbear: :D
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Maxim251: what a nice game
 LastRick: :laughing::skull:
 RaunakCodes2625: hello
 MEtal221: hello
 jacek: oh im 1st in o
 jacek: and his book is really deep
 OldJohn: Only 10 lines
 jacek: oO
 OldJohn: I took a 30 years old program
 MSmits: well mine is only 1 line
 MSmits: it's a very long line
 jacek: logistello?
 OldJohn: No but I was working with Michael
 MSmits: is that one of the designers&#160;?
 jacek: :tada:
 jacek: michael buro?
 Astrobytes: Obviously Michael Buro
 OldJohn: Yes This was my program I took
 jacek: nice place, considering ai advecements in the last 30 years
 MSmits: nice to meet you OldJohn
 MSmits: Maybe you know Renard then, he also used a 30 yr old othello program afaik
 OldJohn: Yes here is a human evaluation no bitboard hastable and endgame
 OldJohn: I know Sylvain yes
 MSmits: oh thats his real name then?
 OldJohn: In fact we did not see each other for a long time
 MSmits: it's cool to meet up here then
 jacek: not even n-tuples?
 Astrobytes: It's like CG has an underground computer board game expert network
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 mzbear: grr.  i cant make a heuristic that beats the boss AND all others to reach the boss.  i give up, i'll start writing a search algorithm after all, i can't do this with pure heuristics&#160;:(
 MSmits: seems like that yeah
 MSmits: mzbear you dont have to
 Astrobytes: tric too, checkers was his thing iirc
 MSmits: if you have a heuristic that beats boss
 MSmits: you will keep submitting
 MSmits: and push the other guys above the boss and promote them
 MSmits: when they're all gone, you got it
 OldJohn: I think dbdr program is probably the best at Othello from a Othello player point of view
 mzbear: MSmits :DDD
 mzbear: that's certainly ... an interesting strategy ...
 MSmits: OldJohn possibly, but dbdr did not add random
 MSmits: it's quite easy to counter
 MSmits: jacek much less so
 Astrobytes: He used multi probcut if I remember rightly
 MSmits: yeah he went all out on this one
 jacek: but mine loses to dbdr considerably
 jacek: im 1st due to submit luck
 MSmits: right and also because my bot wins 96% vs dbdr and maybe 80% vs you
 MSmits: because of the damn random
 MSmits: i did a lot of submitting after which the game went still, so thats also why you ranked above dbdr
 MSmits: not much luck to it
 OldJohn: The long opening line versus your program is only because my program did not find the winning move but I saw it and check with more thinking time with my computer
 jacek: ohh so personally you are good othello player?
 MSmits: that's cool OldJohn, I sense a kindred soul
 OldJohn: Are you all using bitboard&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Great to have guys like you playing on here, really
 Astrobytes: I believe mostly everyone is using bitboards yes
 OldJohn: In fact  I have a bad program in '89 that was using bitboards that competed in Computer Olympiads
 jacek: most here use bitboards
 MSmits: yeah I use a 2x 64 bit bitboard
 darkhorse64: OK, I think I understand how n-tuples works (at least how to implement it, why it works is another story). Still have to work on TDL namely how to update the weights
 MSmits: thats where i am also
 MSmits: the patterns work because in othello (if this is the game where you do it)  local patterns can tell you the value of the board. 
 MSmits: you wouldnt be able to do this in uttt, because moves will make you jump all over the board
 MSmits: in othello you will have some isolated fronts
 MSmits: not entirely.... but close enough
 darkhorse64: It reminds me of UTTT tritboards for the encoding. It might also be applicable on Y with 4-tuples
 MSmits: thats exactly what i do in uttt, i use tritboards for lookup. I guess it's kind of like using miniboards as ntuples
 MSmits: but as eval its not that great
 MSmits: because of the interdependence of the miniboards
 MSmits: it's really a domain specific thing
 darkhorse64: I have not touched that thing for months. Even if I know implementing bonus for teccles, mini board wins or free moves would help
 struct: any other game anyone would like to see?
 Astrobytes: Don't forget Amazons
 MSmits: is gomoku worth doing?
 MSmits: I'm going to regret suggesting this :P
 MSmits: not sure if maybe it's solved or unbalanced or anything, i came across it reading papers
 MSmits: apparently go players play it to relax after a go game
 MSmits: I dont like go, but i do like to relax
 Astrobytes: stops them go-ing moku
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: isnt amazons solved?
 MSmits: probably you can grow it to a larger size
 MSmits: or something
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure Nine men's morris would be a boring game here on CG
 Astrobytes: need 12+
 struct: I dont think Amazons is solved
 MSmits: nine mens morris is easily solved
 MSmits: could also be grown
 Astrobytes: that's why I said 12
 Astrobytes: can't remember much about it though, I read some papers 
 Astrobytes: a while ago
 Astrobytes: afk for a bit
 struct: seems like gomoku is forced win/draw for black
 struct: They use swap rule
 MSmits: is the game interesting when swapping?
 MSmits: because the same is true for yavalath, its a forced win for p1 on 7 starting hexes
 MSmits: but with swap its a very interesting and balanced game
 struct: Its a different kind of swap
 MSmits: oh?
 struct: "In Swap2 rule, the first player starts by placing three stones (2 black and 1 white, if black goes first) on the board. The second player then selects one of three options: play black, play white and place one more stone, or place two more stones and let the first player choose the color.[5][6] This is essentially a slightly more elaborate pie rule."
 MSmits: ahh ok
 reCurse: Ohh I remember nine men's morris. It was to study minimax in some AI course I had at university decades ago.
 reCurse: They organized an AI tournament for it, little did I know at the time it would be useful so long after&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like you are older than i always thought
 reCurse: I know -_-
 reCurse: 18 years ago so maybe decade was not quite plural yet
 struct: for some reason I Thought he was in 20-30 range
 struct: 25-30*
 reCurse: Need to bump that up a little
 MSmits: well struct you were right he was
 MSmits: and then he wasnt anymore
 MSmits: I always thought he was my age
 MSmits: almost 40
 eulerscheZahl: that matches my imaginations
 reCurse: Yeah getting closer
 reCurse: sigh
 LightFury01: hello guys
 LightFury01: how you doin
 LightFury01:&#160;:)
 monami7000: great
 monami7000: am 56 years old, learning to code
 MSmits: you're never too old to code
 MSmits: I mean look at reCurse, he still does it
 MSmits: :P
 reCurse: Hey you're older than me though not by much
 reCurse: shush
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: getting older ain't that bad tbh
 Astrobytes: For now
 struct: MSmits I think i asked you this before, do you think bitboards are worth on STC?
 LastRick: Even those of us that are *cough* even older can learn a lot here. This site has been a pleasant surprise
 Astrobytes: Nice to hear. Good to have another convert on here. And there're plenty 'mature' people on here&#160;;)
 mzbear: ffs my bot got high enough to challenge boss ... 12 losses against the boss, no wins ... outside the arena i keep winning half of the time
 LastRick: Boss: Know your place, son.
 wisp1st: Know your place Boss
 kovi: oh, recurse is older than me :o
 eulerscheZahl: Artrosebytes
 Astrobytes: lol wot
 Astrobytes: how old are you kovi?
 kovi: 50
 mzbear: you know what, i'm gonna cheat ... i'll just predetermine some random seeds that win against the bot every time, since it's deterministic
 Astrobytes: I'm 38, I don't think recurse is 50+ btw&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: that's now what I understood eitherbut a good way to trigger him
 mzbear: actually, i could test out every top bot in silver league to see if they are deterministic, and figure out some seeds that win against most of them ;D
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 Astrobytes: write a search already mzbear, your masochistic approach is making my teeth itch :D
 mzbear: there we go, 3 hardcoded seeds that each always win against the boss, chosen at random (so i wont get stuck against other deterministic ones).  i feel so bad doing this
 mzbear: but i want to get to gold league without search
 LastRick: Good gracious, more contributions? I think we're over 110 now.
 LastRick: I was going to make a joke earlier this morning about breaking through 100. Hah, we've blown by now.
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's getting a little crowded in there. Mostly clashes too I think.
 jacek: clashes :f
 LastRick: Over 80 of the 110
 reCurse: Is that the game now, triggering me? :P
 Astrobytes:&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: nn uttt clashes?
 reCurse: wtf people think I'm 50 now
 Astrobytes: Yeah, GRAMPS :P
 reCurse: I'm 36 geez
 jacek: ok boomer
 LastRick: Hey, thats Euler's nickname
 LastRick: gramps
 Astrobytes: I was pointing it out to kovi that you were not in fact, older than him
 reCurse: Game is over, I'm triggered :p
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 kovi: im reliefed then (loosing vs. younger is acceptable) sorry i misunderstood the relations in chat, you refered to msmits probably not manami
 reCurse: Haha yeah
 reCurse: Strange curve, usually it's acceptable to lose vs older
 reCurse: When does it shift?
 AI_says_hi: Hey folks I have a general question: Som eof the bot programming challenges recommend using machine learning, e.g. genetic algorithm. Is the ML-mechanism supposed to learn within a single game? Or is there a way to carry over parameters? Thanks&#160;:)
 elcolumbio: at 45
 elcolumbio: 42
 Astrobytes: 37 reCurse :P
 jacek: you cant 'save' anything from the game
 reCurse: F
 Astrobytes: you can run an online search, or you can download replay data and train offline
 LastRick: I've had a related GA question sitting on the forum for a few days with no answer, I'll throw it out here. I've been reading a lot recently about GA, mostly word guess examples and I would love to code Search Race. I know ppl aren't going to share code. But any suggestions about the choice of gene/crossover/mutations would be appreciated.
 reCurse: Whatever gets you out of it :P
 Astrobytes: thrust + angle?
 RoboStac: LastRick - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html</a> and just ignore anything about blockers

 eulerscheZahl: IQ is defined via average intelligenceif your intelligence remains constant but newer generations get smarter, your IQ value drops
 struct: so the older people IQ might increase
 reCurse: Hmm...
 MSmits: struct, my bitboard floodfill was not very fast on STC, but i never finished the bot
 reCurse: Not sure what to make of both&#160;:)
 LastRick: Robo: I've read that article and one point I'm confused about is he's evaluating  chromosomes with pod1 and pod2 directions and he picks the "best" one to output. But he also says he looks six steps into the future. Is the "best" option the one that puts in the best position for the next turn? Or the one that puts in the best position six turns in the future?
 struct: I guess I won't try it then
 struct: Also I'm not familiar with bitboards so I guess it would take me a while
 MSmits: dont try it on STC, but do try it on any boardgame
 MSmits: its really not that hard, only a few things to learn
 MSmits: i should say, its not hard to get the bitboard state working. But to make a quick sim is sometimes a challenge
 MSmits: for example bandas pushing and oware seeding
 MSmits: othello has free code you can google
 MSmits: so the sim problem will be solved there
 RoboStac: LastRick - play out the 6 turns and then calculate a score (if you look at the score function in 5.2.1 you can see the loop to play turns before evaluating) 
 jacek: yeah, but what about boards over 8x8, or over 11x11 (so you cant cheat with int128_t)
 MSmits: i did bitboards on ooc
 MSmits: just make an array of ints
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: recurse won with bitboards on ice and fire
 jacek: and i see youre resubmitting O bot now :o
 MSmits: yeah, i fixed it
 jacek: fixed?
 eulerscheZahl: added entry to opening book
 MSmits: yeah so it doesnt lose vs our new friend&#160;:)
 struct: I saw puyo puyo code of a person doing it with 2 int64
 eulerscheZahl: so last to edit the book wins?
 MSmits: in theory yeah
 MSmits: but so far that always seems to be me :P
 reCurse: Saying you win with bitboards is a bit like saying you win with C++...
 MSmits: sure, but jacek was suggesting bitboards are hard to use in some games
 jacek: HTML is programming language
 eulerscheZahl: temporarily i got first with code
 reCurse: So a bit boring
 jacek: pun intended?
 reCurse: Maybe
 jacek: MSmits you could print the book moves like him
 MSmits: or i could do it like you and always print book
 MSmits: didnt you do that in one game?
 jacek: the other O game
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: I wouldnt print my book moves, because that would make it really easy to counter
 jacek: i used to in bt to print book randomly up to 38..46 plies
 MSmits: thats funny
 jacek: to troll the boomers
 jacek: bookers*
 MSmits: nice mistype
 Astrobytes: excellent
 MSmits: typo
 jacek: or was it?
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: you are a mystery
 MSmits: aww damnit, i lost my 46th othello game
 MSmits: damn your random
 MSmits: :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Skril: thanks eulerscheZahl for Space Maze&#160;; it was a fun and interesting puzzle&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: wouldn't it be boring with everyone deterministic?
 MSmits: yeah i am just kidding. It would be very boring
 eulerscheZahl: i saw you solved it, congrats Skril
 eulerscheZahl: you are the 7th to solve it without me
 MSmits: good job skril, apparently that one is very hard
 Astrobytes: 7 now, nice
 Skril: thanks&#160;:-)
 jacek: oh you lost again
 MSmits: yeah, i never completely finished royale and your's playlines, too many options. 
 MSmits: also royale kept resubmitting different versions, i got a bit fed up :P
 MSmits: doing this makes me think about what othello AI tournaments must have been like
 MSmits: opening books must have been huge. Checking official games, trying to counter those moves etc.
 MSmits: either that or they found some way to prevent it... but i doubt it, the game is very simple
 MSmits: as in few states
 jacek: thats why at some point they banned opening books for chess or forced some balanced openings
 MSmits: they would have to look at the source code to know someone is using one
 MSmits: a book that counters a specific bot is very small, so it's not even going to show in the size of the executable
 MSmits: i guess they can *suspect* and players can be sporting enough to try not to cheat
 reCurse: It's solved by forcing random openings
 reCurse: Or in chess, use chess960
 MSmits: yeah I guess so
 MSmits: Onitama does a good job of this
 mzbear: WTF .... i used hardcoded seeds that guarantee 100% winrate outside of arena ... and still lost against the bot twice in the arena
 MSmits: calculation time might be somewhat different in the arena for some languages
 eulerscheZahl: which game?
 mzbear: UTTT
 MSmits: i should say performance
 eulerscheZahl: gold boss? is not deterministic
 mzbear: silver boss
 mzbear: i'm trying to beat silver without a search algorithm :D
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i don't know that boss
 MSmits: what algorithm do you use?
 eulerscheZahl: but your plan doesn't sound fun to me 
 MSmits: if else?
 MSmits: or eval?
 darkhorse64: trueAI
 eulerscheZahl: GAimax
 Astrobytes: You need a Prune Array
 eulerscheZahl: was waiting for that
 mzbear: a lot of if else, practically
 MSmits: well you can solve regular TTT with a reasonable amount of if else
 mzbear: the only "search" thing is two step lookup towards certain loss or certain win
 MSmits: ah ok
 mzbear: other than that, it generates moves and does rules like always taking a local win if it blocks enemy global win, etc
 mzbear: and once no rules match, it goes through the possible moves and picks disruptive moves first, i.e. ones that sends enemy to subboard that can no longer contribute to global win
 mzbear: etc
 MSmits: ah I see
 MSmits: I can totally see getting into gold with a good heuristic bot like that
 MSmits: did you add teccles?
 jacek: and tentacles
 Astrobytes: that might be the missing part
 Astrobytes: (teccles)
 tarikyildiz: hello here the puzzles are very confusing to me, what should I do?
 MSmits: in case you dont know teccles:  It means, when you come to an empty board, you pick the move that has the same position on the miniboard as the miniboard has on the big board
 mzbear: people keep mentioning the teccles but i didn't find what it is.  someone described it briefly and i got the idea of the disruptive moves from that, but my disruptive move play only triggers late game
 MSmits: or in other words, that sends the opponent to the same board
 MSmits: this is a very strong heuristic when employed by search bots. I see no reason why it wouldnt help for a heuristic bot
 mzbear: so i understood it correctly.  i didn't try it, though, because it feels a bit odd, but maybe i'll try it
 mzbear: my current bot got rank 3 in silver league ... so close
 Astrobytes: and teccles works better early-mid game too right? So the late-game disruptive move should kick in at the right moment
 MSmits: I played millions of games locally, it is almost always the best move
 mzbear: huh
 MSmits: exceptions maybe in the late game (20 ply + ) but even then its almost always the best move
 Astrobytes: If you add that and get legend I'll give you 0.001€
 Astrobytes: Next year.
 jacek: silly, there wont be next year
 MSmits: err, you mean after the UK is out of the EU?
 Astrobytes: Yes&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: that doesn't stop him from the ability to own Euros
 MSmits: true
 eulerscheZahl: i still have some Kunas
 Astrobytes: This is true.
 MSmits: i dont know what kunas are
 eulerscheZahl: the currency in Croatia
 MSmits: is this some fantasy game currency
 MSmits: oh ok
 Astrobytes: I've got some drachmas hanging around somewhere
 eulerscheZahl: fantasy Croatia :D
 MSmits: didn't you guys have marks?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: Deutsche Mark or DMark for short
 Astrobytes: now they have Merks
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: is a Merk a follower of Merkel?
 Astrobytes: Merkel Mark = euro 
 MSmits: owww
 MSmits: you're operating on another level today astro
 Astrobytes: well, I mean I just made it up but, it works
 MSmits: cant reach it
 Astrobytes: you've only just come back, give it a few days
 MSmits: hey i was never really gone. I just didnt say anything :P
 tarikyildiz: Hello. Do you have any Turks on this site?
 Astrobytes: yeah we noticed :P
 MSmits: let me check tarikyildiz
 Astrobytes: tarikyildiz: quite a few I believe yes
 MSmits: well not on othello anyway
 Astrobytes: Isn't the guy currently streaming Turkish?
 <b>**MSmits should have gone to the full leaderboard</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: why tarikyildiz? Can we help you with something?
 MSmits: There are 23171 accounts from Turkey
 struct: Not many
 MSmits: Highest ranked is Jazzcript at 1447
 struct: only 20 on fall challenge 2020
 MSmits: about the same number as Dutch players
 MSmits: (23688)
 eulerscheZahl: but i can tell you 3 dutch players right away
 struct: but 126 dutch on FC2020
 tarikyildiz: thank you astrobytes i write when i need help&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: OK cool tarikyildiz&#160;:)
 MSmits: which 3?
 struct: you, counter and someone else
 eulerscheZahl: you, jh bonarius, counter balance
 MSmits: counterbalance me and&#160;?
 MSmits: oh bonarius sure
 Astrobytes: what happened to Mr Bonarius
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 SBtree-bit: I can't wait!!!
 eulerscheZahl: he became the wood clown
 MSmits: great avatar 
 Astrobytes: He was kinda down on his luck I remember
 Maxim251: How pasible is to make code 29 letters size? In perl and Bash on Temperatures
 MSmits: I think he had problems with the short timeframe of contests
 MSmits: as in 10 days is too short for him
 MSmits: he liked locam
 Astrobytes: Yeah that too, but like he got divorced and stuff
 mzbear: hmm.  teccles made the early game of my bot quite a bit more aggressive, but late game weaker against the boss :O
 MSmits: Maxim251 people do some extreme stuff to code golf
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i totally missed that personal drama
 MSmits: some languages are more suited to it
 Astrobytes: wasn't a drama as such, just remember him mentioning it when he reappeared a while back
 MSmits: mzbear i would still keep it, it lowerst the branching a lot
 MSmits: you can fix it with different if elses
 MSmits: it's objectively an improvement, but it might not mix well with the rest of your bot as it currently is
 Astrobytes: try just your disruptive move heuristic in the endgame and use teccles earlier
 Astrobytes: (and variations on that)
 MSmits: if the boss is completely deterministic, you can also just make a little opening book
 mzbear: well, my bot kinda relies on luck :D
 MSmits: just put in some states your bot encounters every game and force it to do some move you know is good
 Maxim251: my code have 222 letters long, but if I replace if statment with&#160;?&#160;:  I could have few extra. All variables are 1 letter long, and I cant do nothing more, because i need keep {} ()&#160;; what are extra letters
 MSmits: i dont know Maxim251, but you can google code golf tips or do a lot of clashes in shortest mode
 MSmits: i picked up some tips there... though i am not that great at it
 mzbear: i'll try cheesy approach first ... 3 hardcoded seeds that always win against boss outside arena, let's see how well teccles works against other players
 MSmits: well you're not searching so cheesy is a must
 MSmits: this is game is about as search friendly as you will find
 MSmits: and heuristic unfriendly
 Maxim251: This is the code
 MSmits: oh i have another heuristic
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/061ae823-3895-42dd-95f5-567b04f5aa6a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/061ae823-3895-42dd-95f5-567b04f5aa6a</a>
 MSmits: mzbear
 Astrobytes: I told him, but he took the masochistic route :D
 MSmits: never play middle square
 MSmits: if there are less than 2 squares filled
 mzbear: oh? that's interesting
 MSmits: unless it's the starting move
 Lks10: you can remove the indenting to save characters I think
 MSmits: middle square is bad
 MSmits: because you send the opponent to the middle board
 MSmits: sometimes its still good, but not when you only have 0 or 1 squares filled on a board. There's better ways to get 3 in a row then
 Maxim251: This one is hardcore... and have 212 letters long
 Maxim251: #include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int t;int a=5527;int main(){int n;cin&gt;&gt;n;cin.ignore();for(int i=0;i&lt;n;i++){cin&gt;&gt;t;cin.ignore();if(abs(t)&lt;abs(a)||(abs(t)==abs(a))&amp;(t&gt;a)){a=t;}}if(t==0){a=0;}cout&lt;&lt;a&lt;&lt;endl;}
 MSmits: mzbear you can also watch some top 10 matches and mimic the playstyle
 MSmits: you will see a lot of teccles then too
 struct: for(int i = 0;i++&lt;n;)
 struct: is shorter
 Astrobytes: Maxim251:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/tips-and-tricks-for-code-golfing-in-c/694">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/tips-and-tricks-for-code-golfing-in-c/694</a>
 Maxim251: Oh thanks&#160;:)
 mzbear: huh wtf
 mzbear: so, teccles worked REALLY well against players in silver
 MSmits: good&#160;:)
 struct: I told you mzbear...
 mzbear: but it seems so unintuitive!
 MSmits: it's a pretty deep tactic
 MSmits: not obvious
 MSmits: the main thing is (I think)
 Maxim251: #Astrobytes, thanks a lot&#160;:)
 MSmits: when you win a board
 reCurse: Complaining about unintuitiveness in uttt
 mzbear: 50% of battles done and i'm already at first place
 reCurse: Sweet summer child
 Astrobytes: you're welcome Maxim251
 MSmits: you want there to be as many of your opponent marks in there
 MSmits: because those are wasted
 mzbear: oh lol, i pulled some other guy above boss with me
 MSmits: so when you send your opponent to the same board, you guarantee that he has marks on there as well
 MSmits: meaning that if you win it, he wastes them
 Maxim251: for(int i = 0;i++&lt;n;) I didn't know that this is posible&#160;:)
 MSmits: I think that's part of it anyway
 eulerscheZahl: for(;;)is the same as while(true)
 MSmits: its hard to see. But meta mcts doesnt lie
 Westicles: Maxim251, you don't need an endl
 Maxim251: Yes, I already removed it when I realised that
 Maxim251: Thanks
 Maxim251: Code size is now 202
 Astrobytes: finally getting an endl on things
 Astrobytes: (I'll just get my coat)
 mzbear: promotion to gold league in 25 minutes
 Astrobytes: congrats mzbear! 
 Maxim251: Starting at using namespace, everything is on that line. Only IOstream is on seperate line
 mzbear: i should've just tried teccles earlier ... i didn't do it because it didn't make sense to me.  lol
 eulerscheZahl: got me from bottom legend to mid legend
 Astrobytes: There's usually good reason when people give you tips
 Maxim251: Oh, Yes, I can remove ints, and all variables assighned to one int
 mzbear: even if there's a good reason, it doesn't feel good if i dont understand it :P
 struct: cout &lt;&lt; t?a:0 &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: and you can remove the if(t==0){a=0}
 Astrobytes: as reCurse will tell you, good luck understanding UTTT
 MSmits: the main problem with uttt is that in the beginning, many moves are about equally good
 Maxim251: #include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int t,a=552,n,i;int main(){n;cin&gt;&gt;n;cin.ignore();for(i=0;i++&lt;n;){cin&gt;&gt;t;cin.ignore();if(abs(t)&lt;abs(a)||(abs(t)==abs(a))&amp;(t&gt;a)){a=t;}}if(!t){a=0;}cout&lt;&lt;a;}
 MSmits: there is no clear difference
 MSmits: aside from trying to connect two x's or O's
 Maxim251: #include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int t,a=552,n,i;int main(){n;cin&gt;&gt;n;cin.ignore();for(i=0;i++&lt;n;){cin&gt;&gt;t;cin.ignore();if(abs(t)&lt;abs(a)||(abs(t)==abs(a))&amp;(t&gt;a)){a=t;}}if(!t){a=0;}cout&lt;&lt;a;}
 eulerscheZahl: do you need that cin.ignore()
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 struct: I dont think he needs it
 Astrobytes: chat golf eh
 Maxim251: Hm, what I can do with that?
 eulerscheZahl: abs(t) == abs(a)t*t == a*a
 Astrobytes: remove it
 mzbear: so, now i gotta wait 20 minutes before i get to see how badly this heuristics bot performs in gold league ... i suppose i'll take a look at that space maze that was mentioned earlier
 Maxim251: Yes, It works.
 Astrobytes: mzbear, you'll need a raycasting NN and spend a week writing down all the testcases
 MSmits: or just learn a search, it's really not that hard for a simple game like uttt. Unless you already know search and just dislike it
 Maxim251: #eulerscheZahl Thank You. I was thinking that I need it
 MSmits: huh what Astrobytes?
 eulerscheZahl: then we are getting in a range where std::cin might be shorter thanusing namespace std
 MSmits: he thanks you by giving you your own channel eulerscheZahl
 Astrobytes: It was some guy we had on here for like 2 weeks going on about space maze, euler remembers
 mzbear: i did fairly fine with MCTS in Blocking, i just didn't want to do another MCTS right away
 eulerscheZahl: his ray casting didn't go anywhere
 Astrobytes: his rays were blocked
 Maxim251: #eulerscheZahlabs(t) == abs(a)t*t == a*a
 MSmits: ahh ok mzbear, makes sense
 Maxim251: I dont know how aplay that to my code
 Maxim251: My code now have 166. WOW
 eulerscheZahl: "abs(t)==abs(a)"you have that verbatim in your code
 MSmits: nice
 mzbear: i figured it would be more fun to get into gold league without search, and it was indeed fun... kinda :D
 Lks10: Go for minimax on UTTT for a change
 MSmits: my theory is that if you go minimax and work out the best heuristics for pruning, you can later use this in a mcts
 Maxim251: yes
 Astrobytes: Surprised you haven't attempted that yet MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: replace it by a*a==t*t
 MSmits: i did attempty a minimax
 MSmits: my problem with minimax is that i always do it after i heavily optimize a mcts
 MSmits: so its always worse and that demotivates me 
 Maxim251: Wow, It works...
 Astrobytes: heh heh, not like you at all
 Maxim251:&#160;!! Yes, now I know why I use abs...
 MSmits: Maxim251  -3*-3 = 9
 Astrobytes: you know why Maxim251?
 MSmits: self multiplication removes minus signs
 Lks10: I have the reverse problem where I have an optimized minimax, but dont want to work on mcts lol
 MSmits: like abs does
 Maxim251: This mathematics removes -.. Ohhh 
 MSmits: unless you use i
 eulerscheZahl: and you have more abs in your code
 MSmits: be careful of i
 eulerscheZahl: stop flexing with your muscular belly
 MSmits: :P
 Maxim251: 154 now, 
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: nice Maxim251
 Maxim251: #eulerscheZahl Thank You so much, You show me greate stuff for lenght of code optymisation&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: also you can use import rather than include
 MSmits: it's not even his specialty
 eulerscheZahl: that's creating weird puzzles
 MSmits: you're not really into code golf are you euler?
 Maxim251: #include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int t,a=552,n,i;int main(){cin&gt;&gt;n;for(i=0;i++&lt;n;){cin&gt;&gt;t;if(t*t&lt;a*a||(a*a==t*t)&amp;(t&gt;a)){a=t;}}if(!t){a=0;}cout&lt;&lt;a;}
 eulerscheZahl: nope smits
 MSmits: yeah you make good stuff
 eulerscheZahl: using namespace std;
 Maxim251: Yes?
 eulerscheZahl: remove and use std::cin
 MSmits: and std:cout?
 eulerscheZahl: of course
 MSmits: can you do some alias thingy for std?
 Westicles: don't need int with main
 MSmits: or is it not worth it?
 Astrobytes: #import&lt;iostream&gt;
 Maxim251: 144 :D 
 Maxim251: Is blowing my head now :D
 Maxim251: :alien:
 eulerscheZahl: if(!t){a=0;}cout&lt;&lt;a;
 eulerscheZahl: struct shortened that already
 Astrobytes: depends how many times it's used MSmits
 struct: or you can even do
 eulerscheZahl: for(i=0move the initialization to declaration
 Maxim251: But cout now need std::cout
 MSmits: right
 struct: cout&lt;&lt;t||a;
 struct: if im not mistaken
 Maxim251: #include &lt;iostream&gt;int t,a=552,n,i;int main(){std::cin&gt;&gt;n;for(i=0;i++&lt;n;){cin&gt;&gt;t;if(t*t&lt;a*a||(a*a==t*t)&amp;(t&gt;a)){a=t;}}if(!t){a=0;}std::cout&lt;&lt;a;}
 eulerscheZahl: or make it a global var, that's preinitialized
 Astrobytes: replace #include &lt;iostream&gt; with #import&lt;iostream&gt;
 Maxim251: I made already global, 
 eulerscheZahl: for(;i++&lt;n;)
 Maxim251: Also for "for" statment is using global i
 Maxim251: But i - I should have at 0&#160;?
 struct: for(;--n;)
 Maxim251: YES WORKS.
 eulerscheZahl: while(--n)for readability
 eulerscheZahl: which is a killer argument when golfing
 Maxim251: :thermometer_face:
 Maxim251: Thats insane
 Maxim251: 144
 eulerscheZahl: you were at 144 before
 Maxim251: Maybe because of std::cin?
 Maxim251: #include &lt;iostream&gt;int t,a=552,n,i;int main(){std::cin&gt;&gt;n;for(;--n;){std::cin&gt;&gt;t;if(t*t&lt;a*a||(a*a==t*t)&amp;(t&gt;a)){a=t;}}if(!t){a=0;}std::cout&lt;&lt;a;}
 struct: if(!t){a=0;}std::cout&lt;&lt;a;}
 Westicles: you still have the int on main
 Astrobytes: ah yes, you missed it from previous version
 Astrobytes: 1. Remove int from main.
 Astrobytes: 2. replace #include &lt;iostream&gt; with #import&lt;iostream&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: remove i
 struct: std::cout&lt;&lt;t||a;
 Maxim251: No, after removing int and adding main to ... Error
 Maxim251: #include &lt;iostream&gt;int t,a=552,n,i, main(){std::cin&gt;&gt;n;for(;--n;){std::cin&gt;&gt;t;if(t*t&lt;a*a||(a*a==t*t)&amp;(t&gt;a)){a=t;}}if(!t){a=0;}std::cout&lt;&lt;a;}
 Maxim251: I must have int for main
 struct: wait my thing might not work
 Astrobytes: no, you missed a semicolon
 Astrobytes: @Maxim251
 Maxim251: Hmmm still error.
 Astrobytes: works for me
 Astrobytes: i, main() -&gt; i;main()
 Maxim251: #include &lt;iostream&gt;int t,a=552,n,i, main(){std::cin&gt;&gt;n;for(;--n;){std::cin&gt;&gt;t;if(t*t&lt;a*a||(a*a==t*t)&amp;(t&gt;a)){a=t;}}if(!t){a=0;}std::cout&lt;&lt;a;}
 Maxim251: :fearful::scream: Yes, works.. How that posble
 Astrobytes: because you don't need to specify the return type of main
 Astrobytes: now change your #include
 Maxim251: Shows me requires a type specyfier, but without int works
 struct: std::cout&lt;&lt;(t?a:0);
 Maxim251: then it will behave like void
 struct: if(!t){a=0;}std::cout&lt;&lt;a;}
 Astrobytes: #import&lt;iostream&gt;
 Westicles: Let's do space maze together next
 Astrobytes: lel
 struct: for(std::cin&gt;&gt;n;--n;)
 struct: for(;std::cin&gt;&gt;t;)
 struct: and you dont even need to read the number of temperatures
 struct: you can remove n
 struct: oh you need to read n
 struct: im sorry
 struct: you just dont need to use it
 struct: for(std::cin&gt;&gt;t;std::cin&gt;&gt;t;)
 Maxim251: How to write? I am lost
 Maxim251: #include &lt;iostream&gt;int t,a=552,n,i;main(){std::cin&gt;&gt;n;for(;std::cin&gt;&gt;t;){a=t;}if(!t){a=0;}std::cout&lt;&lt;a;}
 Maxim251: sorry
 struct: int t,a=552;int main(){for(std::cin&gt;&gt;t;std::cin&gt;&gt;t;)
 Maxim251: #include &lt;iostream&gt;int t,a=552,n,i;main(){for(;std::cin&gt;&gt;t;){a=t;}if(!t){a=0;}std::cout&lt;&lt;a;}
 Astrobytes: And once more (last time):replace #include &lt;iostream&gt; with #import&lt;iostream&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: you need a macro for that astro
 Maxim251: int t,a=552;int main(){for(std::cin&gt;&gt;t;std::cin&gt;&gt;t;)
 Maxim251: not working
 struct: that is not the entire code obviously
 struct: Its just the start before the { of the for loop
 MSmits: you guys are really on a mission to help this guy&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's nice
 mzbear: but if he's just copypasting everything blindly, you're not helping him :D
 Astrobytes: Indeed eulerscheZahl :D
 eulerscheZahl: it's not about helping anymore
 eulerscheZahl: we are golfing
 Astrobytes: it's about golfing
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: aha
 mzbear: my c++ solution to that is 106 chars, and there might still be room to trim a few easily
 eulerscheZahl: for(...){instr1;instr2}for(...)instr1,instr2
 eulerscheZahl: removes the {}
 mzbear: for example, that 552 ... i thought the specification said 5526 so i initialize my variable with 9999
 eulerscheZahl: int n,r,t;main(){std::cin&gt;&gt;n;r=n*1e3
 eulerscheZahl: my code
 eulerscheZahl: and print r at the end
 Maxim251: #import&lt;iostream&gt;int t,a=552,n,i;main(){std::cin&gt;&gt;n;for(std::cin&gt;&gt;t;std::cin&gt;&gt;t;){if(t*t&lt;a*a||(a*a==t*t)&amp;(t&gt;a)){a=t;}}if(!t){a=0;}std::cout&lt;&lt;a;}//for(std::cin&gt;&gt;t;std::cin&gt;&gt;t;)
 Maxim251: found -2 expected 1
 eulerscheZahl: now you added the variable i again
 jacek: oh my
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: at least I don't need my macro now
 struct: #import&lt;iostream&gt;int t,a=552,n,i;main(){std::cin&gt;&gt;n;for(std::cin&gt;&gt;t;std::cin&gt;&gt;t;)
 struct: #import&lt;iostream&gt;int t=0,a=552;int main(){for(std::cin&gt;&gt;t;std::cin&gt;&gt;t;)
 eulerscheZahl: why did you add the *int* main again?
 struct: I initialized t to 0 by mistake
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps struct around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/45097182899192" /> struct: oh lol
 Astrobytes: :D
 Maxim251: sorry, somebody else paste it previously, then I update code, but I make mistake and I go back to working state..
 mzbear: hmm, i'm actually not losing every battle in gold UTTTT ... rank 423 out of 631
 jacek: gold uttt? nice
 Astrobytes: good stuff
 mzbear: gold uttt ... without a search algorithm
 Maxim251: Yes I see it t=0; 
 struct: you can to t;
 struct: or t, 
 MSmits: gj mzbear
 MSmits: btw these heuristics you used, actually went unnoticed on uttt for a year or more after the multi went live
 MSmits: i mean teccles and such
 MSmits: so you're pretty advanced already :P
 Maxim251: Yes, works, is 5 letters shorter with 
 Maxim251: for(std::cin&gt;&gt;t;std::cin&gt;&gt;t;)
 Astrobytes: yeah, when you do a search you should be destined for greatness mzbear
 MSmits: mz:bear:
 Maxim251: 133 now
 struct: exec("...");
 MSmits: gonna take out the trash, i expect you to be below 130 when i get back
 Maxim251: My head is now hurting me.. Thats insane how I could reduce code...
 eulerscheZahl: you alone&#160;:)
 mzbear: well yea, the entire AI of mine takes 0.01ms - 0.05ms per turn to do its job
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Maxim251: No, never, Thanks To You ALL
 Astrobytes: hey, we had fun
 Westicles: please add a comment attributing us all
 Astrobytes: Just don't ask us to do that again :P
 Maxim251: My self I will take 2 years after I will find that insane tricks
 eulerscheZahl: we didn't even start yet
 Maxim251: I will try, But thats ... Oh I need print that on paper an memorise it :f
 Maxim251: :D
 Maxim251: :nerd::hugging::ghost:
 eulerscheZahl: the whole check if you should update the temperature can be done with a polynomial instead of if(t*t&lt;a*a||(a*a==t*t)&amp;(t&gt;a))
 eulerscheZahl: btw you can remove some () here
 Astrobytes: polynomial: when you don't feed your parrot.
 Maxim251: Ill check that
 Astrobytes: (sorry, my maths teacher used that in school)
 eulerscheZahl: i don't get it
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if a language barrier or just stupid
 Astrobytes: Stereotypical name for a parrot = Polly. Don't feed it? Polly no meal.
 Maxim251: I think I can remove {} from if statment
 eulerscheZahl: ah :D
 jacek: if you teach parrot to say "parrot, parrot", youll have a pokemon
 Maxim251: 129
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_Series">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_Series</a>but the parrot is Kiki and Polly is the aunt
 Astrobytes: Oh jeez, Enid Blyton
 Maxim251: :thermometer_face:
 LastRick: Jokes and idioms are always the toughest to translate
 eulerscheZahl: read 10 books and you pretty much know them all
 Astrobytes: read 1 Enid Blyton book and you know them all
 eulerscheZahl: but child me liked them
 Maxim251: 125
 Astrobytes: I only read a few since my grandmother had a few of them
 Astrobytes: *only read them
 Maxim251: #eulerscheZahl I fount that, I know what you mean to remove () from (t*t&lt;a*a||a*a==t*t&amp;t&gt;a)a=t;
 Maxim251: 123
 Maxim251: 119
 eulerscheZahl: if(condition)doStuff!condition?:doStuff
 eulerscheZahl: #fr just pinged me
 eulerscheZahl: sokoban :imp:
 Astrobytes: I forgot you made that
 DomiKo: omg
 DomiKo: I didn't know
 DomiKo: it is finished
 DomiKo: I have to do it!
 Astrobytes: lol
 Westicles: hah, they should kick him for english
 Maxim251: !t?:a=0; hm I think I did something wrong
 eulerscheZahl: not t, that whole part(t*t&lt;a*a||a*a==t*t&amp;t&gt;a)
 Maxim251: I know what I did rong
 Maxim251: t?:a=0
 Maxim251: this is proper
 Maxim251: 116
 Astrobytes: you get an allowance of 2 English conversations a year in #fr Westicles
 Maxim251: But there is or statment
 eulerscheZahl: i then butchered the french grammar while writing there and pinged automaton
 eulerscheZahl: who responded that he doesn't understand
 Westicles: when I visited #fr: Stilgart: merci aux modérateurs de faire le travail et de me dégager le provocateur ci-dessus 
 eulerscheZahl: that was against you, not against writing English
 Astrobytes: I saw that euler :D
 Maxim251: Thats so wired,
 eulerscheZahl: but when you stay there too long writing english, they want to get rid of you
 eulerscheZahl: had a great deepl translation there
 Astrobytes: Unless it's of the utmost importance and imperative that it must be dealt with quickly
 Maxim251: #eulerscheZahl Yes I found it out how aplay&#160;?&#160;: without if statment
 Astrobytes: Or when #fr is almost empty
 eulerscheZahl: original: CopperFr writes "please write French" (in English)deepl: fr-&gt;enCopperEng: please write English
 Maxim251: &gt;Whole line now is shining at yelow, and still works.. i
 Astrobytes: :D
 Maxim251: #import&lt;iostream&gt;int t,a=552;main(){for(std::cin&gt;&gt;t;std::cin&gt;&gt;t;)!(t*t&lt;a*a||a*a==t*t&amp;t&gt;a)?:a=t;t?:a=0;std::cout&lt;&lt;a;}
 Maxim251: 117
 Maxim251: Hey, earlier was 116
 Astrobytes: Good work. Don't keep posting it in case someone copies&#160;;)
 jacek: ban
 Astrobytes:  /ban everything
 Maxim251: sorry, 
 Astrobytes: Hey I don't mind, it's your code 
 Maxim251: but there must be if statment in one place, now again I get 116
 Maxim251: 114
 eulerscheZahl: i found it again!<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/KSthGGJ">https://imgur.com/a/KSthGGJ</a>
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Maxim251: sorry 116 because I try lower value for a, but is not passing validator 2 with big numbers
 Maxim251: Then Oficially 116 and my brain want now jump out from my head
 Stilgart: Westicles: you are not welcome on #fr, indeed
 Westicles: you speak for #fr?
 Westicles: self-appointed authority as usual
 Maxim251: Thats insane, that ruby can make 49 characters and pas all tests.. There are 1000 peoples with similar resultat, then second place is yavascript 60 characters
 Stilgart: self-appointed bastard as usual&#160;:)
 Westicles:&#160;:)
 struct: Maxim251 there are shorter than 49 chars
 Astrobytes: guys, guys, come on. Not in public eh
 MSmits: #catfight
 MSmits: I made channel for you
 Westicles: We are just joking around, we made up
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/Codingame/blob/master/Optimization/Number%20Shift/NumberShift_LAHC.cpp#L138">https://github.com/marchete/Codingame/blob/master/Optimization/Number%20Shift/NumberShift_LAHC.cpp#L138</a>
 MSmits: o
 pb4: Anybody understands that nextFloat() function&#160;?
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: did the moderators do anything yet&#160;?
 Maxim251: #struct Ples dont tell me that stuff... I try kep my brain in place...
 pb4: What's the range of the float number that is generated&#160;?
 LastRick: Holy moley, while you guys were fighting, I solved Thor 2. What a day, first the stupid cat and now this.
 MSmits: do you mean the cat puzzle?
 MSmits: or did your cat do something
 LastRick: HAH, yes the stupid pixel perfect cat puzzle
 MSmits: I'm just asking because euler's cat does stuff
 darkhorse64: I have a perl at 48
 darkhorse64: oops scroll
 MSmits: that sounds like you're an old oyster
 LastRick: yes, eulers cat will soon be motioning it is time "fur" sleep (SWIDT)
 Astrobytes: MSmits: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: this morning my cat puked in my room again&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: but not as bad as when she did it inside the open cat door
 MSmits: thats what I mean!
 eulerscheZahl: so it was inside of my room, outside and in the door itself
 MSmits: it's a pro
 eulerscheZahl: and i had to open the door and smear it further to get cleaning utensils
 MSmits: so evil
 MSmits: at least you dont use a roomba
 Westicles: pb4, you making a run at NS?
 MSmits: maybe he just needs floats
 MSmits: we've all been there
 pb4: Nope, just randomly saw this code on the forum
 MSmits: you randomly saw code that generates random numbers?
 DomiKo: is it [0, 1]?
 LastRick: and those kind of pet stories are why I have no animals
 MSmits: that you know of
 LastRick: It doesn't work that way!
 MSmits: some rodents come out when you sleep
 MSmits: :mouse:
 MSmits: euler doesnt have that problem
 LastRick: or theres a chipmunk in the parking lot thats really fond of me
 MSmits: he only finds pieces of them in a puddle
 LastRick: whats worse than finding a dead mouse in your apartment floor?
 MSmits: two of them?
 LastRick: half of one
 eulerscheZahl: a had a night with 2 living mice in my room
 eulerscheZahl: cat released them while i was sleeping
 LastRick: "released"
 Astrobytes: my Gizmo got a sparrow a year or so ago
 LastRick: ROFL
 MSmits: he caught mice and dropped them in your room euler?
 MSmits: is this a reverse cat?
 LastRick: hahah
 ArianPunk: Guys, can someone tell me how test case number 04 of Dungeons and Maps is not a TRAP?
 LastRick: i dont think that cat knows how cats work
 MSmits: Gizmo was your cat?
 MSmits: Just wondering because thats the name of a gremlin
 Astrobytes: Cats aren't overly murderous, they're more sadistic. Once the 'toy' has served it's purpose, they toss it aside
 MSmits: dont feed after midnight
 LastRick: Arian: You asking about "Many maps" test?
 ArianPunk: yes
 Astrobytes: That's who she's named after MSmits. The one in my avatar
 MSmits: ohh ok
 Astrobytes: You can't see her chin here, but it's big like Gizmo
 MSmits: so then you know why not to feed after midnight
 MSmits: acid reflux right?
 Astrobytes: Yes. Also applies to this one.
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: pic when she was a kitten:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://russianaicup.ru/profile/Astrobytes">https://russianaicup.ru/profile/Astrobytes</a>
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: she has a nice rating
 LastRick: Arian: Haven't done this one in a while but it appears my code finds two solutions and index 2 is the shorter one, so it outputs "2"
 Astrobytes: not overly no lol MSmits
 ArianPunk: ah
 Astrobytes: I actually meant to post the pic link not the whole page&#160;:/
 ArianPunk: Ok, thnx. I'd think about t
 ArianPunk: it
 DomiKo: pb4 that union trick is fast division by (1 &lt;&lt; 32) - 1
 LastRick: If it helps, map 0 also has a solution for that test but its the longer one by two steps. No problem
 MSmits: Astrobytes be proud, thats around where Magnus Carlsen is
 ArianPunk: i think it's got a problem
 ArianPunk: i dont understand why it's not a trap
 Astrobytes: MSmits hahaha
 ArianPunk: I'm not coding on it. Literally solving it by hand
 ArianPunk: There are 5 maps, with 11 by 11 in x and y directions
 Astrobytes: arenabot localhost 31002
 Astrobytes: woooops
 Astrobytes: sorry
 MSmits: ArianPunk

 jacek: .
 Astrobytes: ,
 Astrobytes: this is why we need the webchat. Posting punctuation.
 jacek: so quiet
 Astrobytes: Tends to happen when the chat dies.
 MSmits: I can give you a new subject if you want
 MSmits: help me improve my breakthrough evaluation function
 MSmits:  i rank 9, its embarassing :P
 MSmits: got a whole bunch of features
 MSmits: but doesnt seem to help much
 Astrobytes: haven't done it yet
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: darkhorse64 had problems with it too
 Astrobytes: you're doing an alphabeta
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 MSmits: nah same as always, EPT
 Astrobytes: ah OK
 jacek: you have endtables for breakthrough?
 MSmits: i do
 jacek: probably bigger and better than mine
 MSmits: it's basically a triangular pattern to see if a pawn can race to the end
 MSmits: it's checked as soon as a pawn goes on the opposite side of the board
 MSmits: so 5th row
 Astrobytes: seems reasonable
 MSmits: then again when it gets on 6, 7, 8 etc.
 MSmits: well 8 is a win
 MSmits: but you get the idea
 jacek: bunch of features, piece square tables?
 MSmits: yeah i have penalty for a piece being on the edge, penalty for empty columns
 MSmits: squares that are attacked
 MSmits: home guard bonus
 MSmits: vertical and horizontal connection bonuses
 MSmits: but not bigger patterns
 MSmits: it is all local
 MSmits: I'd say Ntuple or similar would work here
 MSmits: maybe i also just need to prune moves more
 Astrobytes: you use ntuples on BT jacek?
 jacek: when i had handcrafted eval, i had: piece, square table, if piece is H-connected on row 6+, penalty if piece attacked and not protected (and not my turn)
 jacek: no, NN
 Astrobytes: ah right
 jacek: empty column? did you see that C# breathrough bot?
 MSmits: yeah i think so jacek
 MSmits: only eval example i could find
 MSmits: probably it doesnt work
 jacek: it did nothing for me, as well vertical connection. horizontal connection only further in enemy territory
 MSmits: I see
 Astrobytes: how's your littlegolem bt bot?
 MSmits: is this to make sure your pawn doesnt go charging into enemy territory without backup?
 Astrobytes: seems like it
 jacek: yeah
 jacek: though usually against weaker bot single pawn can rush by diagonal unprotected squares
 jacek: well, rating 1807, 27 games so far, 27 won
 MSmits: yeah but not early, when there's double rows
 jacek: though 1 would be lost if opponent didnt make mistake
 MSmits: whats littlegolem?
 jacek: site with games you can play against players
 jacek: correspondence, you get usually 24h for move
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/info/player.jsp?plid=140575">https://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/info/player.jsp?plid=140575</a>
 pb4: What is n-tuples&#160;?
 MSmits: is it cheating to use an engine?
 MSmits: wow pb4 you missed a lot of chat then&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Nice. Is that against just bots or mixed? Not sure how they do matchups on there
 MSmits: n-tuples is basically looking up a pattern on a board
 Astrobytes: No, bots are indicated as such I think MSmits
 jacek: they permit it. i bet you read paper about bt bot and they used little golem to see how strong is their bot
 MSmits: actually pb4, you sort of did this with yavalath
 MSmits: looking up parts of the board for 3 or 4 in a row
 MSmits: except instead of looking up the win, you use the result as a key into an array with eval scores
 MSmits: and use a bunch of patterns like that to form an evaluation score
 pb4: Thanks
 pb4: Why that name&#160;?
 MSmits: well N because there can be N squares you're looking at
 MSmits: and tuple because it consists of multiple parts
 Astrobytes: because they are tuples of n-size :D
 pb4: Can they be non-neighbours&#160;?
 jacek: its just common name. if you look for n-tuples youll find mostly for othello, connect4 and 2048
 Astrobytes: Sure, if it fits the game
 MSmits: jacek i see, yeah i do remember that paper and the name little golem seemed familiar
 jacek: yes
 saikoaizen: LO
 MSmits: pb4 they can be anywhere on the board
 MSmits: but it makes sense to have patterns with squares that affect eachother
 pb4: Is there an automatic way to choose which tuples to use, or is it intuition&#160;?
 MSmits: well intuition if you dont use a NN
 MSmits: NN's kind of naturally makes tuples, except you dont see it
 Astrobytes: game-dependent, there might be well-defined patterns
 jacek: actually both. you can use GA etc. to create N-tuple architecture and see which is best
 Astrobytes: interesting idea
 pb4: Gotcha
 MSmits: jacek uses them in Othello
 MSmits: there's a lot of stuff to google about ntuples in othello
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311555004_Systematic_Selection_of_N-Tuple_Networks_for_2048">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311555004_Systematic_Selection_of_N-Tuple_Networks_for_2048</a>
 pb4: Maybe I should try and play one of those board games you've all grinded
 MSmits: well you did join on yavalath, but then you stopped
 MSmits: you did quite well there
 pb4: Yeah, couldn't find a way to improve
 MSmits: neither did i, my bot is about as strong as yours still
 pb4: wut&#160;? You were first, I was ~5th no&#160;?
 MSmits: except of course for the millions of locally simulated games to avoid early game traps...
 pb4: ah
 MSmits: i mean if i ignore the book :P
 pb4: :D
 Astrobytes: I was about to comment on that
 pb4: I'll soon have a new PC
 pb4: muuuuuuch faster
 MSmits: good
 saikoaizen: Heyo 
 Astrobytes: so you'll be around here more then?
 saikoaizen: New PC dude, that's awesome
 MSmits: I only use 1 core each though, for my opening books. It's more about manually adjusting things, letting it run for a while,  inspecting etc.
 pb4: Don't know Astrobytes, still have to spend a bit of time with the family :o)
 Astrobytes: hehe, yeah pb4, always a trade-off&#160;:)
 MSmits: he needs to build up credit with family, so he can then crush us in a contest
 pb4: :innocent:
 Astrobytes: hah
 pb4: I also have a bandas AI that was 1st when it was still a contribution puzzle
 MSmits: ohh nice
 MSmits: the top meta uses endgame books now
 MSmits: other than that its mostly plain mcts
 pb4: Was kinda bummed that the author didn't take any of my comments into account and let an unfinished game be published
 MSmits: was one of your comments the fact that the random is unbalanced?
 pb4: Don't remember, it was a long time ago :o)
 MSmits: ah, well that is the main problem
 Astrobytes: I vaguely remember something but yeah
 MSmits: I can solve some games at ply 7
 MSmits: sometimes its a loss, its a bit frustrating
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-bandas/101048">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-bandas/101048</a>
 pb4: Wasn't willing to spend time on a game that was going to change
 MSmits: "The game was accepted despite negative pending comments on the random game generation."
 pb4: Either it's a contrib and I'm perfectly happy to test it, rewrite my code when breaking changes happen, etc...
 pb4: -contrib +WIP
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/21242d55ddfe36f93a624d9d405cc234295e">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/21242d55ddfe36f93a624d9d405cc234295e</a>
 pb4: or it's been accepted, and they it shouldn't change anymore
 MSmits: well if it's an improvement to the random generation, its an ok fix after it goes live, because that shouldnt affect your bot too much
 MSmits: but mostly i agree yeah
 Astrobytes: (link is original contrib btw)
 MSmits: he did improve his random 
 pb4: iirc map size was changed after the fact
 MSmits: increased I guess?
 pb4: Yup
 MSmits: because if it was smaller I could solve it on ply 1 probably
 MSmits: very small branching factor
 MSmits: and with the endgame books the game ends at 3x4 size
 jacek: map was originally 6x6 but i think he changed it before accepting
 jacek: also i think it was before the WIP option
 Astrobytes: he did, yes
 pb4: You have a bool[500 000] table for the endgame status&#160;?
 MSmits: hmm its not that big I think
 MSmits: 3^12 
 pb4: 3^12&#160;?
 pb4: That's 500k&#160;:)
 jacek: 15
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: i do then
 MSmits: it's a string, calculated locally
 MSmits: heavily compressed
 Astrobytes: physics you say Smits, physics eh
 MSmits: :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 pb4: Compressed how&#160;?
 MSmits: symmetry helps a bunch
 MSmits: factor of 8
 MSmits: 10 results in 1 unicode character
 MSmits: so thats a factor of 80 right there
 pb4: Nice&#160;!
 MSmits: i couldnt go beyond the 3x4
 MSmits: because there is no 13 sized pattern
 MSmits: and the next one would be 14
 MSmits: which is 9x bigger in possible combinations
 MSmits: also pretty rare to have a 2x7 situation
 reCurse: Oh a wild pb4, rare sight
 pb4: Hi old guy :innocent:
 reCurse: :sweat:
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: have you been lurking while we messed with reCurse?
 pb4: I might have :sweat_smile:
 pb4: I might be lurking far too often
 Astrobytes: yes, you should join in more
 MSmits: yet ntuples were new to you
 MSmits: i bet you dont know jacekmax either
 pb4: far too often is not 100% of the time -_-
 pb4: Nope, what is it&#160;?
 MSmits: jacekmax made a thingy
 MSmits: jacek i meand
 pb4: @reCurse&#160;: new computer incoming, many more cores
 reCurse: I feel bullied
 pb4: I'll probably give SR another go
 MSmits: jacek where's your playground thingy that explains the jacekmax?
 Astrobytes: best-first minimax thing guided by UCT
 Astrobytes: looking now
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct</a>
 reCurse: Maybe we should act like civilized people and divide game territory
 karliso: I am also puzzled why it is 100ms and not 50ms on bandas.
 jacek: theres jacekmax in tags
 MSmits: karliso you mean it would save server time&#160;?
 MSmits: and have quicker submits?
 karliso: No, it would make it less unbalanced.
 MSmits: you're right though, the game does not get more interesting for having 100 ms
 jacek: bandas is nearly solved
 MSmits: ah yes
 Astrobytes: karliso, did you give up on raic?
 karliso: Astrobytes not at all
 karliso: MSmits With 50ms there is a greater chance that a weaker bot will make a mistake.
 Astrobytes: oh I saw you were a lot lower earlier, improvement incoming I guess&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah i got it karliso, good point
 MSmits: I already sometimes see them make a mistake
 MSmits: my bot will solve the game as a loss on ply 12 or so, then its a win at ply 18
 pb4: Never thought about that "best-first minimax search" before
 pb4: I like the idea&#160;:)
 MSmits: it works fine pb4, i tried it on oware, my bot got to the same rank. I didn't optimize it as well as my other version so it seemed quite a bit weaker still, but maybe with more optim, or different eval it woul dbe just as good as my EPT
 pb4: EPT&#160;?
 MSmits: mcts with early playout termination
 Astrobytes: there may be situations where it's better than ept
 MSmits: except my playout terminates at 0
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: so its basically mcts with an eval instead of a sim
 MSmits: its similar to jacekmax, except jacekmax replaces minimax style and my ept version adds up score instead of replacing
 pb4: If you could suggest *one* of the board games on which to focus, which one would it be&#160;?
 Astrobytes: tough call
 MSmits: what do  you enjoy about a boardgame
 MSmits: do you want one that can be opening booked
 MSmits: this could be annoying
 jacek: do you want to work on optimizing eval
 reCurse: Is there anyone who could possibly enjoy that?
 Astrobytes: I can think of *one* person at least
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: personally i would recommend Onitama
 MSmits: it's pretty to look at and the game has interesting mechanics
 MSmits: no opening books
 MSmits: also shouldnt take a huge amount of time
 MSmits: oh and, minimax and mcts both viable
 pb4: Don't really know what to enjoy with board games, I need some kind of intuition of what makes a move good, and I generally don't have that intuition for board games
 MSmits: mcts with eval i mean
 jacek: or breakthrough. bitboard friendly, many possible features for eval
 reCurse: I recommend uttt then
 jacek: ill take a screenshot then
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: :D
 pb4: I peaked at 80k unguided rollouts on UTTT, with instawin and instaloss-avoidance
 MSmits: thats not bad
 pb4: Wasn't good enough, and to be fair to reCurse I had absolutely no motivation to write an opening book :D
 MSmits: in general i mean
 MSmits: also
 MSmits: uttt is definitely about more than just sims
 jacek: teccles is good opening book
 MSmits: theres people in top 10 with 70k
 pb4: I seem to remember 100k or 105k to be the reference for the metric I gave
 MSmits: yes, but a long time ago either people didnt say anything or everyone just used plain mcts
 MSmits: now theres a lot of useful heuristics out that all help a bit. Together they help a lot
 MSmits: and opening books are really not that useful unless your opponent is one of the best bots and they play deterministically
 pb4: or maybe I should get back to Fantastic Bits :rage:
 reCurse: Quality trolling
 reCurse: Something I should aspire to
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 MSmits: what i meant was, in all the games that have a predetermined start, uttt is the game where books are the least useful
 MSmits: as far as i can tell
 pb4: So many games in the menu, I have trouble finding the ones you suggested -_-
 MSmits: really pb4, do onitama
 pb4: First time I need ctrl+F on CG...
 MSmits: I had the most fun there
 reCurse: It's right there in the search bar
 MSmits: until i ran out of ideas
 struct: :broken_heart:
 jacek: try yinsh
 pb4: oh wow
 MSmits: struct, there is short term fun and long term fun, yavalath was long term fun :P
 pb4: Never occurred to me the search bar existed -_-
 MSmits: onitama was like a month, i think i spent half a year on yavalath
 jacek: and how much on oware?
 MSmits: mmh 2-3 months if you dont count the meta mcts stuff
 pb4: I still have no idea how you handle transpositions in MCTS on Yavalath
 pb4: All the ways I think about seem crazy expensive
 MSmits: i dont know if it even works very well, it just helps me solve earlier
 MSmits: it is pretty expensive
 jacek: he uses it offline in meta mcts
 MSmits: halves my rolloutcount
 MSmits: or so
 jacek: not in actual game
 MSmits: no actually i do
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: but it just doesnt help very much
 MSmits: its the only game where i do this
 MSmits: in meta mcts it helps a ton indeed
 MSmits: i like the early solves though
 MSmits: thats why i kept it in
 jacek: i thought of buying new computer, but there is no available cpu and gpu i want until january/february :rage:
 reCurse: Yeah I'm in the same boat
 pb4: I'll look up onitama
 MSmits: euler made it
 MSmits: which is one reason why its good
 jacek: he *ported* it
 MSmits: good eye for detail
 MSmits: sure, the mechanics, but he put it together well with the free art he found
 MSmits: it has a good style
 MSmits: also they made sure a lot of unbalanced starts where removed. trictrac tried to solve all the possible gamestarts
 pb4: gotta go
 MSmits: kk nice talking to you
 MSmits: gn
 pb4: bye
 reCurse: bye
 pb4: Thanks for the suggestions&#160;:)
 MSmits: np
 struct: bye
 Astrobytes: bye!
 jacek: c-c-c-combo breaker
 Astrobytes: Every. Single. Time.
 MSmits: I know you reference killer instinct but i still miss something here
 Astrobytes: breaking the chain of similar/same messages/posts
 MSmits: ahhhh ok
 Astrobytes: it was a forum thing initially iirc. Remember when we all used forums?
 jacek: phpbb2?
 MSmits: i never used forums that much
 MSmits: wait no, memories come back
 jacek: ptsd?
 MSmits: i used them disguised 
 MSmits: like, inside a browser game
 Astrobytes: lose the 2
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: I played astro empires and utopia
 MSmits: they had forums
 Astrobytes: phpbb
 jacek: well it was version
 struct: states reduce quite a bit if I take into account that stones are the same color
 Astrobytes: I always love your on-topicness struct
 Astrobytes: It's a stream of consciousness thing&#160;:)
 struct: yes, I just say what comes to mind
 MSmits: you don't need weed struct
 MSmits: you're a natural
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: lol jacek... I think I just found a line of perfect play for your oware bot, leading to a draw
 MSmits: no wonder it took so long
 MSmits: well there's no way to counter that
 jacek: my bot plays it perfectly?
 MSmits: its not a solve, but the entire line of play does not have any alternatives to keep searching. They all lead to the same seed count or worse 
 MSmits: well i cant be sure
 MSmits: but it seems so
 MSmits: I found one with re curses bot also
 MSmits: he doesnt play it often, but when he does i cant beat him
 jacek: in ancient africa you would be oware god
 MSmits: thanks, I like that
 MSmits: I am assuming here that oware abapa is solved as a draw under CG conditions
 MSmits: awari is, but the rules are slightly different and the 200 turn limit might also cause problems
 MSmits: I found that if you have 9 seeds left on the board, you can get a different end result depending on how many turns are left, as far back as 145 tirns left
 MSmits: so its worse for more seeds
 Astrobytes: déjà vu...
 Cybersick: Salut le monde
 MSmits: exactly, oware has deja vu
 MSmits: loops
 MSmits: you got it Astrobytes

 MSmits: shoo shoo trekkie
 struct: #fr
 Cybersick: There is an interesting talk about the nasa engineer in a round table
 Astrobytes: That's what I get for speaking a french phrase
 jacek: oui
 karliso: I am curious about oware: if you do openings + NN + endgame tabels code size is supposedly a problem and you have to make a tradeoff between thse 3?
 Astrobytes: Cybersick: #fr for French links, also on discord&#160;:)
 MSmits: I calculate my endgame tables in the first second karliso
 MSmits: its not in code side
 MSmits: size
 MSmits: it is for bandas, but not for oware
 MSmits: and I dont use NN
 MSmits: thats the rest of the top 5
 jacek: all top 4*
 Astrobytes: pushed back down?
 MSmits: wait what, did they put me at 5 again
 jacek: robo added random
 Astrobytes: oh, robo submitted earlier I forgot
 MSmits: yeah i knew that
 MSmits: i thought i went down to 4
 jacek: SupSon submitted most recently
 MSmits: ah yea i see it
 Astrobytes: I've not gone down to 50th or something have I
 MSmits: 13
 Astrobytes: ah cool, not so bad
 MSmits: supson is 0.09 above you
 Astrobytes: meh. After raic
 struct: Wasnt SupSon top at UTTT?
 MSmits: at one time he might have been
 MSmits: uttt improved a lot
 struct: Yeah but is bot is broken now
 struct: I think
 struct: his*
 SupSon: \ o /
 MSmits: how strong was it?
 Astrobytes: I may not get a hoodie but I get a t-shirt and I ain't giving up just yet
 struct: rank 1
 MSmits: yes but compared to which bot?
 MSmits: did it beat nagrarok?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: that bot is unchanged
 Astrobytes: good work SupSon
 struct: it was around same rank as nagra
 MSmits: ahh ok, then supson would now be between 5 and 10
 MSmits: People really go wild on uttt, so any top 10 rank is like being nr 1 in a different board game
 Astrobytes: We should ping SupSon again 
 SupSon: what up
 MSmits: we're out of subjects to talk about so we picked you
 struct: About UTTT
 Astrobytes: just thought I'd ping you again since you had so many mentions in the past few minutes :D
 struct: your bot is broken for a while
 SupSon: yea some compiler change
 SupSon: broke me
 struct: maybe when the sqrt thing changed?
 struct: or something else
 MSmits: hard to fix?
 Astrobytes: sqrt thing changed?
 struct: it was when c++ updated I think
 struct: Before you didnt need to include cmath
 jacek: he uses complex numbers
 MSmits: ohh, yes, be careful about the i
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: loop using j
 MSmits: or k to be safe
 Astrobytes: that was ages ago struct
 SupSon: does karliso on uttt just have the best opening book
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: i dont think so
 jacek: i bet he uses teccles
 Astrobytes: ask him yourself, you pinged him&#160;:)
 MSmits: when he did have an opening book, i wrecked him 100%, then he turned it off and i had no chance
 MSmits: he was strong even without teccles
 Astrobytes: I remember that
 MSmits: my bot in uttt is 3rd even without book
 SupSon: what's teccles
 struct: force opponent to play on the board you just played
 MSmits: its a heuristic
 MSmits: only when the board is empty
 MSmits: so always play on the mid edge of mid board and corner of corner board
 SupSon: Yes that seems like optimal play for the early game
 MSmits: lots of meta mcts confirms this
 jacek: my bot does it automatically given few seconds of thinking
 MSmits: mine doesnt, what magic is this jacek?
 MSmits: you also dont use a lot of sims
 Astrobytes: Pony Magic
 jacek: yeah, seeing people mentioning 100k on second turn makes me think if i count them properly
 SupSon: Is teccles an acronym or something?
 MSmits: its a player
 Astrobytes: Nah, was (is?) a player 
 MSmits: i think it was used before him, but he advertised it
 jacek: when I have 10k on second turn
 MSmits: so how do you count this exactly
 MSmits: is this plain mcts you are using?
 jacek: 10k, so 10k rollouts
 MSmits: and do you playout till end of game?
 MSmits: or early termination?
 MSmits: with some eval?
 jacek: nodes in tree could be greater since i expand all the children, but choose one to do te rollout
 jacek: to the end
 MSmits: do you use any enhancements?&gt;
 MSmits: selection bias?
 MSmits: or some kind of preference for moves in the random rollout?
 jacek: 1-plu win/lose, selection bias for winning small board or not using move that leads to already ended board
 jacek: in rollout moves that win small board have more chance than others
 MSmits: what do you mean by 1-ply win/lose?
 Astrobytes: check if you win or lose in 1 ply
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: in the random rollout?
 SupSon: he means favor early wins
 jacek: rollout and the selection
 SupSon: and late losses
 jacek: no
 MSmits: i do it in the selection, basically that is mcts solver
 jacek: a little more intelligent random
 MSmits: but not in the rollout
 MSmits: does it help a lot to check for wins in the rollout
 jacek: well and mcts solver
 MSmits: i know others said it works
 MSmits: but they say a lot works and then i try it and it does nothing
 jacek: i dont remember how much, but id say something like 55%-60%
 Astrobytes: ohhh in conjunction with solver
 MSmits: i dont understand
 MSmits: 55-60% means the winrate for checking win in rollout vs a bot that doesnt, this i got
 MSmits: but whats the conjunction with solver
 jacek: thats Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: this is on top of the fact he has solver implemented
 MSmits: what is
 jacek: i always have mcts solver
 MSmits: me too
 MSmits: i just wondered what you meant about 1 ply win/loss in selection
 Astrobytes: there
 MSmits: i mean doesnt the solver do that?
 jacek: depends if you expand only by 1 child instead of all children
 MSmits: ohh I see
 jacek: and even if by all children, sometimes checking for win/lose is expensive
 MSmits: yes when i expand and one of them is a win, the parent is a loss
 MSmits: so i stop that iteration
 MSmits: is that what you mean?
 jacek: exactly
 MSmits: ahh ok, to me thats part of normal mcts solver
 MSmits: i am confused though
 MSmits: two things
 MSmits: 1) you're not the best at performance, but usually a lot better than 10x as slow than others
 Astrobytes: now that you describe it thus I agree I also thought that was integral to the solver
 MSmits: 2) how can you rank this high with 10k
 Astrobytes: ^ that's the one
 jacek: dunno
 Astrobytes: PONIES
 MSmits: you literally do the same thing i do except i have a lot more heuristics for pruning and move selection
 MSmits: so i shoul dbe slower
 jacek: maybe those heuristics suck
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: no i tested them of course :P
 Astrobytes: haha
 MSmits: I have a feeling you hold the key to the rest of us beating kar liso
 MSmits: and you dont know what it is
 Astrobytes: *karlis o
 MSmits: yeah i am being secretive
 jacek: karliso?
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: no, the other one
 Cybersick: Thanks for the info Astrobytes :heart_eyes:
 karliso: I would like someone to challenge me, but there is no easy way I guess.
 MSmits: are you talking about uttt
 karliso: yes
 MSmits: as you said before, I could just solve your p2 game again
 MSmits: and win 100%
 karliso: It is not deterministic
 MSmits: it is not random either
 MSmits: there are only so many lines of play
 Astrobytes: de rien Cybersick
 MSmits: especially with teccles on
 MSmits: you make maybe 10 choices with some choices being fixed, some choices being 2 possibilities
 MSmits: so i am guessing at most 200-300 lines of play I need to solve
 MSmits: sounds doable
 Astrobytes: I sense A Challenge
 karliso: I guess you could make unbeatable opening book for p1
 MSmits: I can
 MSmits: I am messing with you, i already have one that beats you 100% as p2
 MSmits: i just havent submitted
 MSmits: its not that interesting to me
 Astrobytes: Does it beat the others though
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: I targeted him specifically
 MSmits: i can push tomatoes to 1
 karliso: Well..
 MSmits: with me as 2
 karliso: I can change opening move and resubmit
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: that is why i did not submit
 MSmits: i was just wondering how big i can make it
 MSmits: the book
 Astrobytes: Do something other than booking?
 MSmits: maybe counter most good lines of play
 karliso: I don't really care... as I got rid of my opening book.
 MSmits: it was the best decision 
 MSmits: your bot is great and a book would only hurt you
 MSmits: i am still wondering what magic must be in those 3k lines of code
 MSmits: i am still testing some other ideas Astrobytes, jacek gave me the idea to add random to my own bot so i can selftest
 MSmits: i will try out that wincheck
 jacek: add random?
 MSmits: yeah, so i dont get overtraining issues
 MSmits: like, a change only works vs myself
 jacek: in uttt?
 MSmits: yes, it happens, my bot gets pretty deterministic as well, just like karliso's
 MSmits: so random helps
 karliso: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/646a267c-cbb7-43f4-9d67-6559a5b516ae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/646a267c-cbb7-43f4-9d67-6559a5b516ae</a>
 karliso: Here is my uttt rollout 
 MSmits: ohhh 
 jacek: endgames eh
 Astrobytes: &lt;everyone furiously saves to file&gt;
 MSmits: my precious...
 Astrobytes: (except me, I don't care :D )
 MSmits: i dont see endgames?
 MSmits: uttt does not seem likely as a game to use endgames with
 MSmits: karliso you still get like 400k rollouts with this?
 MSmits: it doesnt seem like it would do that
 MSmits: ohh i see it
 MSmits: A == UTTT::ENDGAME7
 MSmits: I'm going to have to stare at this a long time before I figure it out
 struct: 400k rollouts?
 karliso: I had a bug where I counted early rollouts twice
 karliso: So I guess 200-250K turn 2
 MSmits: ohh that is much closer to re curse
 MSmits: he had 180k afaik
 MSmits: do i read it correctly that you terminate rollouts early?
 Astrobytes: that's your kinda bug struct :D
 karliso: Not really... unless game is won by 3 in line
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: did you improve selection somehow, performance wise?
 MSmits: I remember you saying once
 Astrobytes: just win detection not ept
 MSmits: that you felt selection isnt always necessary?
 Astrobytes: oh, answered, sorry, don't mind me
 karliso: wdym
 MSmits: and you left it at that, I kept wondering 
 MSmits: i dont know, i figured you maybe did random for the first few visits of a parent
 MSmits: so you didnt have to do the uct calc
 MSmits: or maybe picked with eval
 struct: Astrobytes I guess its a normal thing :p
 MSmits: the first few times
 MSmits: I do think you said you used avx for selection
 MSmits: but that did not help me much
 karliso: I'm always doing UCT, but that could be improved I guess
 MSmits: yeah maybe thats what you meant when you said that, that you thought it could be improved
 struct: the problem with avx is that values wont be alligned right?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: unless you completely mess up your node array
 MSmits: never had the courage to try that
 struct: But does loading the values take that much  time
 struct: for it not to be worth?
 MSmits: it was about equally fast for me
 Astrobytes:  for calculating UCT?
 MSmits: for doing the sqrts
 Astrobytes: ah
 MSmits: 8 of them at once
 Astrobytes: yeah I know the vectorization bit
 MSmits: the problem is that nodes are spaced out 40 bytes each or so
 MSmits: so the visitcounts are also
 MSmits: at least I think thats the problem
 MSmits: you cant just copy a 8 float block
 Astrobytes: time to consult reCache
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 struct: why 40 bytes?
 MSmits: Its just a guess, i dont remember my exact node size
 MSmits: it varies per game
 MSmits: maybe smaller for uttt
 reCurse: What year is this
 MSmits: i knew you would say that
 Astrobytes: '89
 reCurse: It's not conclusive, you could know I would say that yet still be in the past
 MSmits: reCurse you'll be relieved to hear that karliso actually had somewhat over 200k rollouts, not 400k
 Astrobytes: Or thereabouts. Since Old John submitted his 30 year old Othello code I'm going with that.
 MSmits: you can now sleep again
 reCurse: Relived? What
 MSmits: it was bothering you before
 reCurse: Was it
 MSmits: oh yeah
 MSmits: we both didnt get how it could be so high
 reCurse: No such recollection
 MSmits: traumatic events tend to do this
 reCurse: Maybe a past me travelled to the future then went back
 MSmits: sounds right
 reCurse: Can't discount possibilities so easily
 struct: Its the easiest way to increase sims, I did the same for STC
 MSmits: timetravel is the easiest way?
 reCurse: With 2020 the way it's been probably
 MSmits: how is it for you now?
 MSmits: with work and such
 reCurse: Work is fine
 Astrobytes: Vibrating Thing Theory
 MSmits: my job has been somewhat harder with covid
 reCurse: Easiest part of the pandemic for me actually
 MSmits: I mean i am happy to be at home, but when i was teaching with the mask on it was not fun
 Astrobytes: Goobersymmetry, non-Branes and wiggly things that cause trouble
 reCurse: Yeah I'd go nuts wearing a mask 8h a day
 MSmits: one day, i accidentally brought only one mask, it broke just as i wanted to get into the train
 Astrobytes: you use disposable?
 MSmits: then i rushed back to get 4 more, just barely got into the next train
 MSmits: and 3 more broke during the day
 MSmits: usually yes
 Astrobytes: jeez, who made those? Us?
 MSmits: but thats mostly because my wife accidentally bought a years worth 
 reCurse: Why disposable? There's plenty of good ones that are reusable
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I know
 reCurse: How do you accidentally...
 MSmits: but we have them now =/
 MSmits: she didnt do the math
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: they pack pretty tight
 struct: she did ++sims;++sims;
 Astrobytes: is this like winning a 10 year supply of toilet paper
 MSmits: something like that, except toiletpaper is way bigger
 Astrobytes: Well, yeah. That's something at least.
 MSmits: anyway the strings are glued and sometimes the glue lets go
 Astrobytes: string theory for ya
 MSmits: yep&#160;:)
 MSmits: i probably have to go to work one more time on thursday
 MSmits: management decided exam classes still have to be done physically
 Astrobytes: gluons turned to gluinos
 reCurse: There's a pun that's just too easy there
 Astrobytes: Really?
 MSmits: ahh yes supersymmetry
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: great subject
 MSmits: because of the funny names you mean?
 Astrobytes: Why in person?
 Astrobytes: No, I find it curious
 MSmits: oh, well in person learning is inherently better in most cases
 MSmits: and these guys have tests after christmas break
 Astrobytes: yes, but pandemic...
 MSmits: i know, it will only be one day though, the week after thebreak it will be online
 Astrobytes: Fair enough I suppose
 MSmits: it's just annoying for me, because on thursday i will have 2 online classes as well
 MSmits: also my CS class doesnt have a test
 MSmits: so in my case it is not particularly useful
 MSmits: also i have an online course
 MSmits: so why bother with the in person part
 MSmits: but the students are at school all day for other classes....
 Astrobytes: Seems wasteful, but we're human right
 MSmits: right
 SupSon: you guys are humans?
 MSmits: to a degree
 MSmits: Astrobytes seems the most human
 Astrobytes: Why? Cause I have a sore back? :P
 MSmits: though when he said he is into supersymmetry for fun, doubts grew
 MSmits: because you dont do most of the weird things some of us do
 MSmits: it's a compliment :P
 Astrobytes: I do RAIC for fks sake
 MSmits: thats true
 Astrobytes: Isn't that weird enough?
 MSmits: yeah its pretty weird
 reCurse: That justifies talking about uttt then. Possibly.
 Astrobytes: I needed a break
 struct: Did they add fog yet?
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's round 2
 Astrobytes: They just updated with this:In today’s update, we have fixed a vulnerability in server’s pathfinding: since server is aware of the game state, it could pathfind around obstacles that you do not see in fog of war. Now, server-side pathfinding considers cells out of sight range to be empty.
 reCurse: Round 3 has game result decided by observation
 Astrobytes: I'm not moaning, I've qualified for a t-shirt
 MSmits: thats pretty good right?
 MSmits: not sure how strong the opposition is
 reCurse: I'm reminded of brood war tricks if my memory serves me right
 MSmits: never tried raic
 struct: I was thinking on doing
 struct: then I looked at the game
 reCurse: You could figure out where the guy is located if he decided to wall his entrance
 reCurse: By looking at where your unit would go by moving there
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: smart
 Astrobytes: heh heh, yes
 MSmits: so you leave a little hole in the wall to counter this?
 reCurse: There's a good reason you're walling
 reCurse: To prevent run-ins
 reCurse: So no, you don't
 MSmits: well yes but its poor formation if they have to go through a small crack
 Astrobytes: but it's really not SC this game
 MSmits: maybe a small  hole with some turrets
 MSmits: tower defense&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: And I'm not the best person to ask about the real meta rn, since I'm around 179th
 reCurse: What is the real meta Astrobytes
 MSmits: we dont need the best person
 Astrobytes: Turret rush!
 reCurse: So how is that not SC again?
 Astrobytes: It's not the meta I only said that to bait you
 reCurse: Real bunch of meanies today in the chat
 reCurse: Must be MSmits presence
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: speaking of which, nice to have you back MSmits
 Astrobytes: in chat
 MSmits: thanks Astrobytes, feels good to be back
 MSmits: might still not be as active as i want to be. Getting this degree takes more time than i expected
 MSmits: I got about 6hrs a week work relief to do it, but it takes more than 6 hrs a week
 karliso: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/karlisolte/ultimate-tic-tac-toe">https://github.com/karlisolte/ultimate-tic-tac-toe</a>
 karliso: Sharpen your uttt tactis here
 Astrobytes: seriously though, meta seems to be ranged units only, just one barracks (which I was surprised about and am exploring), careful supply depot placement and targeting enemies well
 Astrobytes: haha. The man.
 Astrobytes: Anything to add to that RAIC meta karliso?
 karliso: I thought walls are useless
 MSmits: lol karliso, i like it, but what is your point with this github?
 DomiKo: How that happened that we have learned that much about UTTT today
 Astrobytes: Thought? You have started to use them?
 Astrobytes: Walls and turrets seemed useless tbh
 karliso: I collected pictures of "tactics" and made probably first uttt tactics quiz.
 Astrobytes: The former more than the latter
 MSmits: ohh, it reads a lot like a chess puzzle indeed
 MSmits: I might do something like this for yavalath
 MSmits: for my study project
 Astrobytes: 5D Super Lavayath
 MSmits: with the volcano!
 Astrobytes: Supersymmetry! Now that would add something
 Astrobytes: Scratch that. My brain started overheating at the possibilities
 MSmits: karliso i was worried you shared your bot when you posted that gith
 Astrobytes: Have more faith
 MSmits: earlier he shared his rollout
 MSmits: thats why :P
 Astrobytes: Worthless without context and understanding
 MSmits: if you reverse more words, you'll go all yoda
 Astrobytes: When did I reverse
 MSmits: you didnt, i am saying thats all that's missing
 Astrobytes: Worthless without context and understanding this is, hmm
 MSmits: worthless without context, this is
 MSmits: exactly :P
 Astrobytes: sorry, it's late :D
 MSmits: yeah, i still dont get why that guy thought our late chat is less fun
 struct: Usually its not this active
 Astrobytes: Nah, he's cool, he meant the non-european hours
 struct: At around this time
 MSmits: isnt this non european?
 struct: Give it 20 more minutes and you will see lag ocmplaints
 MSmits: ahh ok
 struct: complaints*
 MSmits: I guess i always miss this
 MSmits: because of sleep
 Astrobytes: after this point, unless a bunch of us are active it's full of idiots, complaints and trolls
 MSmits: I see
 struct: Did not do much progress on STC today
 Astrobytes: yeah, the lag from the updates etc
 DomiKo: struct you doing STC now?
 struct: Im storing states until depth N like euler suggested
 MSmits: you're really into STC struct
 struct: DomiKo I have been doing it for a bit
 struct: then paused
 DomiKo: I see
 struct: I wasted 1 week on trying to make a fast sim
 struct: not worth
 Astrobytes: don't do the bitboard thing then
 struct: I wont
 DomiKo: I wasted 5H trying to beat boss gold with wrong formula for score...
 struct: My first sim had like 30k sims on c++
 DomiKo: sim is 8steps?
 Astrobytes: I could have sworn you had a legend bot before
 struct: no 1 depth
 struct: I had
 struct: my bot is like 2years old
 struct: Then I worked on optimization and never submited
 struct: Now I decided to rewrite
 Astrobytes: that was it
 Astrobytes: well, anyway, I'm all done for tonight
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: see you all later
 DomiKo: See you
 MSmits: gn!
 MSmits: going also
 struct: gn
 FrankGotzTank: Why does my program say that 1000 / 60 = 16.666666666666668???
 struct: precision
 struct: its normal 
 FrankGotzTank: But it should be 16.66666666667
 struct: Which language are you using?
 FrankGotzTank: C#
 struct: hmm
 struct: it gives me right value
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/oAOhQ3t">https://tech.io/snippet/oAOhQ3t</a>
 struct: ah on CG its different
 FrankGotzTank: yeah right
 FrankGotzTank: That's pretty annoying
 Kamikaze: does anyone can help me with ultimate tic tac toe? i was trying to learn the minimax algorithm but i dont know what to do, im trying to make it with python3
 VizGhar: uf... you can't solve UTTT solely with minimax
 VizGhar: if you just want to try minimax, try it on less complex problem (clasic tic tac toe)

 Tiramon: Dame_Mas_Onii-chan plz no clash invites in this channel
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid already kicked him yesterday for this
 eulerscheZahl: go to #clash for those links
 Dame_Mas_Onii-chan: ok
 Andriamanitra: i don't understand how three people thought merging partially overlapping strings is a good clash problem
 Andriamanitra: takes average programmer more like an hour than 5-10 minutes lol
 JBM: elitist bunch
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/50633c3cbd3a763444ff46065cdeb90b02cc">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/50633c3cbd3a763444ff46065cdeb90b02cc</a>this one?
 eulerscheZahl: "Good idea,not too easy, not too hard"
 Andriamanitra: yup that's the one
 aquire: I see lot of skilled people use Ruby, especially for code golf. Is it worthwhile to learn it? I started doing path_to_elightenment.rb. Please tell your opinions.
 JBM: it's worthwhile to learn most any language
 Andriamanitra: depends on what your goals are
 Uljahn: ^
 Andriamanitra: i use ruby because it's fun and has an absolute ton of stuff already built in
 aquire: My goal is to become #1 on CoC
 JBM: you must know ruby
 JBM: and perl and bash
 Andriamanitra: yeah in that case you probably need ruby for golf :grinning:
 aquire: I'm originally a pythoner
 JBM: too bad
 aquire: Did python all my life
 aquire: Yeah
 JBM: yeah i don't know if *you*'re worth it
 eulerscheZahl: and just should know most of the clashes by heart
 JBM: but you can try
 aquire: &gt; and just should know most of the clashes by heartwdym?
 JBM: you won't get to #1 by playing each clash just once
 aquire: Oh that's the secre?t
 JBM: one of them
 aquire: Then it's too boring
 JBM: it is
 JBM: but hey, you picked the goal
 aquire: Yes Didn't know that
 aquire: Anyway I'll learn ruby
 aquire: seems interesting
 JBM: never a bad idea
 Andriamanitra: it might not be the most useful language for general programming these days but it never hurts to know more
 JBM: ruby is general-purpose enough
 Andriamanitra: yeah but if you already know python there is rarely a reason to use ruby instead, they fit many of the same use cases well
 aquire: Python swallowed most scripting languages, lol
 aquire: along with js
 elderlybeginner: how to simplify it in python:not (A and B or C and D)
 DomiKo: hi&#160;;)
 jacek: good afternoon
 aquire: A,B,C,D are booleans?
 amammamamam: pls join
 jacek: well duh
 eulerscheZahl: A and B =&gt; A*B
 amammamamam: my clash
 eulerscheZahl: no amammamamam
 elderlybeginner: a,b,c,d booleans, yes
 aquire: there's not imply operator in python ifaik
 eulerscheZahl: use math elderlybeginnerA and B =&gt; A*B
 eulerscheZahl: with =&gt; I mean replace it
 eulerscheZahl: not(A*B+C*D)
 aquire: ah ok
 elderlybeginner: "A and B =&gt; A*B" - no, * has higher precedence then and
 eulerscheZahl: i don't get what you are saying
 aquire: nice!
 elderlybeginner: A, B, C, D are tests, I will have to take it in ()
 eulerscheZahl: and the not part can be shortened further:A*B+C*D&lt;1
 aquire: yep
 eulerscheZahl: you only get a good answer if you ask the right question. how should we know that A and B are not just variables?
 aquire: pretty neat
 elderlybeginner: @eulerscheZahl: thank you
 elderlybeginner: it regards to that:

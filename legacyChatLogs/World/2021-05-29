 Gaurav.: a \n a
 Scarfield: Is it normal to have the selection as bottleneck in mcts? (working on uttt)
 MSmits: how much of a bottleneck?
 MSmits: also which stage of the game
 Scarfield: in the beginning, so far the only thing im profiling since i cant get more than 20k rollouts in 2nd turn
 MSmits: can you share you uct function?
 MSmits: your
 Gaurav.: rip
 Gaurav.: Hello guys
 Explosion-Scratch: Hallo
 Catas39: can you do here Clash of Code for gaming stuff&#160;?
 Catas39: I mean not the Clash of Code section but something for gaming
 Catas39: I only found the space ship game tutorial
 Wontonimo: Hey Scarfield , I was having a hard time getting above 20k in 2nd turn also.  MSmits suggested I calculage the log(Nparent) just once.  That saved a bunch of cycles.  Also tried replacing new obj with custom array
 Scarfield: yea he helped me out in pms, but thanks&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: in the end what I did to squeeze out some more juice and rank was to run 2-3 rollouts per expansion
 Wontonimo: my rollout was super fast, my expansion not so much, so it worked well
 Scarfield: makes sense then, but right now im just trying to get higher simcount, but good point ill probably try it later&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: have you added the MCTS solver?
 Wontonimo: that certainly boosted me a several ranks.  i dont know if the Gold boss has a solver, but it would be a great way to get an edge with even a lower sim count
 Scarfield: nope, simply "pure" mcts still. When im happy with the simcount ill begin playing with other improvements
 MSmits: gold boss definitely does not have a solver
 MSmits: back when uttt was new, there was already a gold boss and I think robo was the first to use the solver 
 MSmits: because he found that paper that explains it
 struct: I added teccles and jumped from 100 to 57
 MSmits: yeah that does help
 Wontonimo: adding just that could be enough to push you over.  it would be close.  The solver makes your bot super strong in the last dozen or so moves
 MSmits: it guarantees a good move as player one most of the first 20 plies
 struct: teccles is just for p1 right?
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: I use it for p2 too, up to ply 20
 MSmits: it doesnt matter really
 Wontonimo: what's teccles&#160;?
 Scarfield: poor teccles being pinged all the time xD
 struct: if board is clear force opponent to play on that board next
 MSmits: teccles means your move has the same index as your board index
 Wontonimo: oh, that's the heuristic about forcing.  right
 reCurse: Many bots did that before teccles...
 MSmits: ah but things get named after the first person to publicly share&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: yeah, I have that as a "soft" hint
 Scarfield: even my bot finds such a move fairly often
 Wontonimo: if it finds it nearly immediately, then it can spend more resources looking into the future
 MSmits: yeah it does. the NN's mostly use it too
 MSmits: even if it's not hardcoded
 Wontonimo: do you reuse your graph from turn to turn Scarfield&#160;?
 Scarfield: yea good point wonto, and yes tree reused
 MSmits: btw naming this thing teccles, is more about having one word to describe it than giving him any credit. It's just easier for conversation
 MSmits: could have been any name really
 Scarfield: Ill take full credit
 MSmits: Allright, we'll name it the Scar
 MSmits: nice and short
 Scarfield: xD
 BlaiseEbuth: Be preeeeepaaaaaared&#160;!

 DeFau1T: hmm
 MSmits: End games done. Time: 975 ms. States: 646645    
 MSmits: cutting it kinda close =/
 MSmits: (this is times 146 so roughly 10 million states)
 MSmits: it's annoying, I can just barely reach 10 seeds... 
 BlaiseEbuth: Your fault Scarfail...
 MSmits: lol sure let's blame him
 Scarfield: Ill take full credit
 MSmits: kk
 BlaiseEbuth: Always have a culprit on hand.
 MSmits: who can change oware first turn to 1100 ms instead of 1000 ms&#160;? :P
 BlaiseEbuth: [CG]Maxime
 MSmits: ow now you pinged him
 BlaiseEbuth: :speak_no_evil:
 Scarfield: thanks again for the tips, the lookup array and UCB changes improved my 2nd turn simcount with around 2-5k&#160;:)
 MSmits: nice
 Scarfield: also a neat detail with the factorization of invsqrt, didnt notice until i started implementing it
 BlaiseEbuth: Sqrtfield
 struct: why do you need 1100ms MSmits?
 Scarfield: BlamesEbuth
 MSmits: I have a 9 seed endgame book for oware and I made some optimizations and now I just barely can do 10 seeds
 MSmits: i can do it below 1s most of the time, but... cpus
 struct: Not possible to do template magic?
 MSmits: what will that do?
 MSmits: can you show me some example of template magic to make things faster?
 MSmits: sounds like something I should know
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming</a>
 struct: I never did it
 struct: Just heard about it before
 struct: Not sure if its possible for your case, but I guess its worth a read
 MSmits: can you do all calculations at compile time?
 MSmits: this would be an insane boost for me
 MSmits: dont you have several seconds to compile?
 struct: yeah you have more time to compie
 struct: compile*
 struct: Im not sure though, maybe some expert in c++ knows
 MSmits: hmm
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/479ebbcc-89d4-473c-beaa-16c03850ee03">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/479ebbcc-89d4-473c-beaa-16c03850ee03</a>
 struct: If you see this example
 struct: it does calculations
 struct: and its compile time
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh? Always thought compile time was included in first turn time...
 MSmits: i wonder what the limitations of this are
 MSmits: Can I fill an array with 10 MB of states &gt;
 MSmits: complex calculations calling lots of functions
 struct: I never tried it before, but I think its feasible on what you want to do
 1415495: I think that CG has a compilation timeout and I don't think it is very long
 1415495: and I doubt that in 10s of meta template compiling you can do more computation than in the 1s of the first turn
 1415495: the compilo is not what I would call "fast"
 1415495: but I have not tried it so...
 reCurse: Doesn't seem like it's going to work
 reCurse: Doing computation at compile time is very difficult
 MSmits: difficult to write code for or inefficient?
 reCurse: Both
 MSmits: do you ever try this?
 MSmits: on CG?
 reCurse: No
 MSmits: hmm ok
 reCurse: In general, yes
 reCurse: Then even if you succeed on CG, you might break executable sizes
 reCurse: And if you don't chances are IO speed will make the whole thing pointless
 MSmits: well it's gonna be 10 MB larger
 reCurse: So lots of obstacles
 MSmits: I see
 1415495: I tend to think it is a bit of a way to go behind the rules but in the same time, "play to win" so as long as it is not yet forbidden
 MSmits: well it would have a very small effect on gameplay really
 MSmits: I could even keep calculating in the following turns if i want to. I mean I can always run an opening book while I use 50 ms per turn to finish it off :P
 1415495: but in itself, it can be a fun excuse to try meta programming
 MSmits: sure
 reCurse: Fun and metaprogramming and C++, pick 2
 MSmits: gonna submit this bot to see if it even times out
 1415495: if you stumble upon a decoder for template error output by gcc/clang, I am interested&#160;;)
 Scarfield: fun and fun
 MSmits: ye, sometimes times out =/
 1415495: I prefer reading code from ioccc than template error
 MSmits: ioccc?

 1415495: some are really interesting
 1415495: like a tiny (probably very limited) C compiler in 2K source code
 1415495: (not exactly 2K, I think they exclude some characters from the count)

 Skinjbir: hello  world

 <b>**Smelty says</b></p><p><img src="/a/63052365393434" /> jacek: fenrir in Search Race can you tell what was the input for your NN?
 MSmits: lol... I am trying to locally generate a seed db and it's using 31.2 out of 31.7 RAM 
 MSmits: GB
 MSmits: probably i should get off chrome :P
 jacek: oh my
 MSmits: it's only 20 seeds, but for 185 different turns so..
 MSmits: uh oh, this is not good, windows decided i dont need most of that memory for my process, but i do =/
 MSmits: hope it doesnt crash
 MSmits: bah it crashed. Evil windows
 MSmits: how to block windows from stealing my memory&#160;?
 jacek: use linux
 MSmits: :P
 struct: 31 gb for end game tablebase?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I am working on a different method now, so that i can spit stuff out to HD in between
 MSmits: should help
 MSmits: SSd actually 
 MSmits: it's so big because i store a different value depending on how many turns left
 MSmits: and oware can be 200 turns. I skip the first 15
 MSmits: if I didnt have to do the turns thing I would be able to have a 31 seeds DB
 MSmits: probably will do that for NN
 jacek: the things you do for an NN
 struct: Do chess engines train with or without tablebases?
 MSmits: well this 20 seeds thing is just an upgade for my normal meta mcts, but yeah because I want to do supervised for the NN, i need a good endgame table
 jacek: dunno
 MSmits: struct was wondering this yesterday. It seems weird to me if they train on things they dont need to know
 jacek: for tournaments endgame tables may be limited
 MSmits: yeah but they still wouldnt train on the part they dont need to know would they?
 jacek: likely not
 darkhorse64: MSmits: would not it be more efficient to store the number of moves till end instead of storing a pair seeds, remaining moves&#160;?
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: what do you mean number of moves till end?
 MSmits: basically what I am storing is the maximum net gain of seeds given the current board state and the remaining number of turns
 MSmits: (if both sides play perfectly)
 MSmits: the interesting thing is that even for only 9 seeds on the board, 200 turns left up to 146 turns left gives the same result, but below 146 turns left it gives different results. Apparently it takes a lot of time sometimes
 MSmits: it gets worse for more seeds obviously
 darkhorse64: For a given seed which leads to victory, you may win because there is enough moves left, or because you win on score after 200 moves or .... Obviously, the result depends on the remaining moves but storing all pair &lt;seeds, remaining moves&gt; may be overkill
 dscientist: Guys, Is this site French? Several comments in the community are writen in French.
 jacek: its made by french, but world chat is english and most stuff here is in english
 MSmits: darkhorse64 in my eventual DB, I store them in a persistentdictionary with 1 key per state, the key is used to look up a string which holds a value for each of the 185 states. it's 4GB for a 15 seed book, around 40 GB for a 20 seed book (when i am done with it). 
 MSmits: it's really the only way to have an exact prediction of the end result, since the number of turns matters a lot when the result is close
 ZarthaxX: are you really wasting 40gb for oware? D:
 MSmits: sure why not
 ZarthaxX: seems so much sheez
 ZarthaxX: idk haha
 MSmits: the guys who solved aware used around 1TB:P
 MSmits: awari
 ZarthaxX: :O
 ZarthaxX: holy
 MSmits: almost the same game
 ZarthaxX: i just get scared by huge numbers, ignore me :P
 MSmits: but it doesnt have this weird 200 turn limit, so it was easier for them
 ZarthaxX: right
 MSmits: it's the same with our checkers. There are many states which are officially solved as win, but are unwinnable on CG, because they take too long
 MSmits: so it'll just be a draw
 MSmits: and that is true even if you dont repeat any states
 MSmits: thankfully you would not have to store 300 turns of checkers lookups. You can suffice with storing the DTM value (how many turns to win from current state)
 jacek: welp 8-man chess endtables are estimated &gt;5PB
 MSmits: ye it's insane
 MSmits: checkers explodes really quickly also
 MSmits: oware not so bad
 Marchete: so are you solving oware?
 Marchete: are you using it for the NN?
 jacek: either that or cancer research. which one would you choose
 MSmits: not solving, I am going to try to get as big a endbook as i can, run meta mcts for a while and try to supervised learn the NN
 Scarfield: cat girls not an option this time jacek :o
 Marchete: ok
 Marchete: I'm still trying alphazero like
 Marchete: but I'm testing much more each step
 MSmits: sounds good
 Marchete: not really
 jacek: Scarfield thats an obvious
 Scarfield: good good, was afraid you were an imposter
 Marchete: too many things that can go wrong
 Marchete: right now I sometimes have &gt;55% winrate when pit the same NN as P1 and P2
 MSmits: maybe try simple things first?
 Xascoria: hey guys, new around here, quick question
 Marchete: and I swapped positions ofc
 Marchete: 50% as P1 50% as P2
 Xascoria: if i have something that gives the right answer and throws an error afterwards, will the tester be happy with it
 Marchete: not always, but some
 Marchete: maybe I need to go to 57% or smth
 Marchete: or more plays
 jacek: Xascoria gives right answer?
 Xascoria: yes the code gives the right answer
 jacek: you print answer for testcases. if theyre right the testcases pass
 Xascoria: but some janky mechanic will cause it to throw an error right after it
 Xascoria: I mean for the final result
 Xascoria: will i pass or fail in this case
 jacek: will CG testcases catch it and fail
 Xascoria: it says success but it also gives an error
 Xascoria: so im not sure
 Xascoria: also the error stopped rest of the output from printing so that is actually part of my solution
 Xascoria: janky as hell ik
 jacek: i tested and got 100% when after print i thrown a runtime exception
 Xascoria: nice 
 Xascoria: ty
 jacek: Marchete youre pitting 2 NNs against each other?
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: but as a test it's the same NN
 Marchete: so it should be around 50%
 Marchete: sometimes I'm getting 55%
 jacek: just some fluctuations
 jacek: is it trained NN or random
 Marchete: untrained
 jacek: random initialization could favor 1 player
 MSmits: even if untrained it's still very deterministic
 Marchete: but I do 50% of games as P1 and 50% as P2
 MSmits: my untrained TTT player sometimes started with 35% WR vs a random player
 Marchete: so even if it favours
 MSmits: so worse than random
 Marchete: it should be around 50%
 jacek: and how many games did you play
 Marchete: 		Model* m0 = ((i &amp; 1) == 0)&#160;? &amp;candidateModel&#160;: &amp;currentModel;		Model* m1 = ((i &amp; 1)&#160;!= 0)&#160;? &amp;candidateModel&#160;: &amp;currentModel;
 MSmits: is it the same network with the same random initialization?
 Marchete: on a loop
 MSmits: the same random seed?
 Marchete: exactly the same file
 Marchete: no seed
 Marchete: it's oware
 Marchete: just dirichlet noise
 Marchete: added
 jacek: but oware has 48 seed
 Marchete: ....
 jacek: maybe thats your problem :v
 MSmits: i meant random seed for initializing neural network weights
 Marchete: :D
 Marchete: I read from the same file
 Marchete: I have only 1
 Marchete: so
 MSmits: yes, but does this file initialize the weights in the process, or are the weights hardcoded
 Marchete: I'm adding more mcts rollouts and some more games
 Marchete: NN must be exactly the same
 Marchete: file ARe the weights
 Marchete: ARE
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Marchete: and NN won't predict is not "Loaded"
 jacek: is the one if more mcts rollouts winning more
 MSmits: 57% is a plausible WR with 400 games or so
 Marchete: if not*
 MSmits: if it would be 1k+ i'd worry
 Marchete: 500 games
 Marchete: same rollouts, same all
 jacek: so its within confidence interval eh
 MSmits: Marchete does go by rollout count or by calc time
 Marchete: rollout count
 MSmits: does it have a random move component?
 MSmits: or fully deterministic?
 Marchete: fully deterministic is exactly 50%
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: it should be
 Marchete: with dirichlet noise is 45%-55%
 Marchete: maybe I should go more than 500 matches?
 MSmits: it's easier to just add a random 0-0.05 to the NN output
 Marchete: I thought 500 could be enough
 Marchete: I imagine it's easier
 Marchete: but as these papers talk about this noise
 Marchete: I added it
 MSmits: ah ok
 Marchete: probably on "submit" mode
 jacek: dirichlet noise sounds smarter
 Marchete: I'd change it to some 0.95-1.05
 Marchete: yeah, and I just C&amp;P it
 Marchete: because it was overly complex
 jacek: but 500 games is not enough for random init net to see if 55% is legit
 Marchete: ok
 Marchete: so I'll increase it
 Marchete: it's usually inside 47-53
 Marchete: but I want to be sure of each part
 jacek: fyi i dont use pitting, i update NN every iteration and use it
 Marchete: I think selfplay have correct outputs
 Marchete: correct sign of propagated values, etc etc
 Marchete: define "iteration"
 Marchete: my idea was
 Marchete: selfplay N games
 Marchete: output all mirrored as player 0
 Marchete: value is  k*MCTS_mean_value + (1-k)*endgameReward
 Marchete: policy similarly
 jacek: selfplay N games into buffer, learn from buffer, pit in arena (alphago zero but not in alphazero if I understand correctly,
 jacek: and repeat
 Marchete: selfplay-&gt;learn-&gt;pit
 Marchete: winrate &gt; 55%? candidate converted to best
 Marchete: I was thinking that
 MSmits: I think jacek just based on MCTS_mean_value
 MSmits: not endgame reward
 MSmits: so k = 1
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: I need to try different k's
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: endgame reward for oware seems too far away
 RoboStac: yeah, and I do it entirely on endgame reward 
 Marchete: and they are turn based
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero#Relation_to_AlphaGo_Zero">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero#Relation_to_AlphaGo_Zero</a> second point
 MSmits: nice RoboStac
 Marchete: k is high at first turns
 Marchete: because of the uncertainty
 Marchete: and because of that
 Marchete: I have a big doubt
 Marchete: I can have many exact gamestates
 Marchete: with completely different values 
 Marchete: because at start I can win/lose
 Marchete: so I don't know how the trainer behaves with these
 Marchete: i.e. I'll have N starting positions
 jacek: NN will average if there are different targets for the same input
 Marchete: all of them with completely different values
 Marchete: like -0.4 and 0.5 at the same time
 Marchete: it's OK for the trainer?
 RoboStac: seems to work fine 
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-alphazero-part-4-improving-the-training-target-6efba2e71628">https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-alphazero-part-4-improving-the-training-target-6efba2e71628</a>
 Marchete: thanks Robo&#160;:*
 RoboStac: I've seen some (and tried a bit myself) making unique gamestates with averaged policy / values
 RoboStac: didn't seem to make much difference overall - possibly slightly quicker training
 Marchete: I was trying that, thanks for pointing out
 RoboStac: yeah, that article was one of them
 MSmits: if you run 100 games to get data, you'll visit the same states early game also
 Marchete: I've used that, yes
 MSmits: in fact, you always have the same 1st state
 MSmits: so you get that 100 times :P
 Marchete: exactly that
 Marchete: I have 100 1st states
 Marchete: but each one with a "random" value
 MSmits: i wouldnt worry about that
 MSmits: all it does is make that state more important than other states. And it is, so...
 RoboStac: you can just drop the first turn as it's pretty pointless to train on
 MSmits: you can extend that with an opening book on first 5 turns too
 Marchete: well, not in my idea
 Marchete: it should pick the best move
 Marchete: maybe value is noisy
 Marchete: but policy part should be more useful
 Marchete: I won't learn you all anything, nevertheless
 Marchete: I'm "years" behind you in terms of NN
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: Marchete you are doing a policy + value network right?
 MSmits: why not just do value?
 MSmits: seems easier
 ApplePie1212: HELLO
 MSmits: if you're not having much succes it's time to reduce variables imho
 MSmits: damn, I keep finding bugs where I am overflowing 32 bit ints
 jacek: 32 bit? what year is it
 MSmits: for (uint64_t s = 0; s &lt; stateCount; s++)
 MSmits: had this as int s = 0 =/
 Marchete: because I'm not going for easy
 Marchete: I'm going for policy based NN
 MSmits: good&#160;:)
 jacek: *5 years later*
 Marchete: but there are sooo many thingsd
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: at my pace
 struct: you will probably do it before me
 Marchete: this thing is so hard
 Marchete: that even people that "knows"

 Marchete: and all of them can fail

 1415495: did someone derived the formulat for the derivative for the PPO policy update&#160;? I find something a bit weird
 MSmits: you can do it various ways struct
 MSmits: but you need *something*
 MSmits: what i do is a flag that's -1,0,1 or 2
 struct: ok, thanks
 MSmits: when it's 2, the game isnt solved
 struct: I see
 AllYourTrees: is everyone working on NN now?
 AllYourTrees: :eyes:
 struct: not me
 struct: I paused it for a bit
 MSmits: not me... or at least not directly. Working on local oware stuff
 MSmits: 40 gb book finally running correctly. Takes some time to create
 struct: 40gb o.o
 MSmits: i'm about 10% in :0
 MSmits: I am hoping my C# program can read the binary data correctly
 struct: How long does it take to generate it?
 MSmits: hard to say, probably a few hrs? I am guessing 3 hrs
 struct: not bad
 MSmits: yeah but this is 20 seeds. the one i want for NN is 31 seeds
 MSmits: doesnt need more memory, because i am not doing 185 times each state. But it does need wayyyy more calc time
 struct: how many seed does oware have?
 MSmits: possibly 31 is too ambitious
 MSmits: 48
 MSmits: it would take around 1TB to store all states
 RoboStac: I'm fascinated to find out how accurately you can get a &lt;100kb nn to train on that much data
 MSmits: oh, I wasnt going to train it on *all* the data. I am just going to refer to it. I'll let it run games same as you guys, except i am not using the values form the games, just the gamestates
 AllYourTrees: NNs can memorize data very easily
 MSmits: so i just look up target values
 AllYourTrees: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03530.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03530.pdf</a>
 MSmits: very efficiently but not at 100% accuracy
 AllYourTrees: tl;dr: NNs can easily memorize random labels on training data
 MSmits: which is why NN is good on unsolved games, but not on solved games&#160;:)
 RoboStac: yeah, I'm not saying it in a bad way, I'm actually interested to find out how well it works compared to the more standard methods
 MSmits: ahh yeah, me too. Could be a bust
 struct: well the good thing is that you can still use the end game tablebase with it
 MSmits: i am mostly choosing this method, because I need an intermediate step before i try your way
 MSmits: supervised learning just seems easier to me
 MSmits: struct in game just the small one, 9 seeds only&#160;:)
 struct: is 9&lt; seeds common?
 jacek: if you put nn will you have space for endgames anymore
 MSmits: on equal strength bots yeah, but even if the state doesnt occur in the game, it occurs in the tree
 MSmits: my endgame book doesnt use space&#160;:)
 struct: yeah
 struct: o.o
 struct: what magic is that?
 MSmits: i generate it in 1st second
 struct: ah, it doesnt use code space
 MSmits: this is why i was complaining about the time earlier remember
 struct: I thought you meant it doesnt use memory
 struct: sorry
 ddreams: Abusing the time-space continuum
 MSmits: oh, it uses less than 10 MB
 MSmits: so negligible
 MSmits: 9 seed is very small, still millions of states though
 MSmits: locally it's billions
 MSmits: I like that I still get draws vs Robo and jacek even with their new versions that I havent counterbooked
 RoboStac: when I submitted this one my first game against you was a loss, was very worried it was going to continually play into one of your counterbook lines
 MSmits: oh, yeah, I should maybe just remove the book
 MSmits: at least then it'd be more easy for you guys to test
 MSmits: i'd still be rank 5
 RoboStac: it was the only one though so not sure what happened
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: What have I missed recently? Oware still MSmits, you are a dedicated man I must say.
 MSmits: well I did some supervised learning on TTT, got it to play almost perfectly. Now going to try some supervised learning for oware. But needs loads of preparation because I need good data
 MSmits: beefing up endgame book from 15 to hopefully as close to 31 as possible
 MSmits: and running new meta mcts when it is done, gonna be a while
 Astrobytes: OH yeah, I forgot about your newly upgraded hardware
 MSmits: the memory certainly helps
 AllYourTrees: meta MCTS? :eyes:
 MSmits: AllYourTrees do you know mcts?
 AllYourTrees: ya
 MSmits: meta mcts is running whole games instead of random sims
 MSmits: so a mcts thats running other mcts's
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's like an MCTS inside an MCTS, didn't jacek do an article?
 AllYourTrees: huh interesting, ty
 MSmits: yeah he did
 MSmits: AllYourTrees mostly it's used to create opening books
 MSmits: find the best starting moves for deterministic opening games
 Astrobytes: 'on generating opening books for yavalath' I think
 MSmits: but you can use it to solve games too 
 jacek: just replace playout/simulation with MCTS and youre done
 Astrobytes: I'm busy so I won't bother looking it uup
 MSmits: jacek, dont you have some smarter way to choose between search and book?
 MSmits: I never did that part
 MSmits: in my case book is always preferred
 Astrobytes: But switch when off book? Isn't that a normal thing
 MSmits: possibly i am doing it wrong and just doing well by sheer brute calculation :P
 jacek: i choose book if available
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: not sure where i read this then
 MSmits: maybe it is during book creation
 MSmits: bot picks from book sometimes and sometimes tries new moves
 MSmits: something like that
 MSmits: i  just start a game process from the meta mcts leaf
 MSmits: other than that, the two processes have no contact
 Astrobytes: Hm. Well that sounds risky
 MSmits: well the process is running, i am actually reusing it
 jacek: during training i do more randomness
 Astrobytes: "sometimes tries new moves" I mean
 MSmits: oh ok
 jacek: what if it misses better move
 MSmits: yeah me too. I have an exploration of 2.5 usually
 MSmits: in normal games i use 1.0
 MSmits: the hope is that with more visits, it will also find better moves 
 MSmits: mmh my computer is spacing out, maybe I should have stopped the 10-game connect4 solver before i started generating 40 gb book :P
 Astrobytes: anyway, just a brief visit, see ya all later
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 MSmits: btw i tabbed you and it said AstroHydes
 MSmits: is this an alt?
 MSmits: you hide with?
 struct: gn
 Smelty: MSmits y e s
 struct: he uses it during contests due to chat lag
 Smelty: ^
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: 19 GB, going pretty fast
 MSmits: I am writing binary int8_t's in c++ hope C# can understand it when I read it into my other program :P
 MSmits:  i used to write pure text, but that would be too big now
 Smelty: hrmm
 MSmits: it's one byte at a time right, so I am guessing it'll be ok... not sure though
 ddreams: Should be perfectly fine
 1415495: should be fine but be careful with sign/unsigned
 MSmits: yeah that is what worries me
 MSmits: I am writing signed bytes. 
 MSmits: so either it goes from -127 to +128 or -128 to + 127 right?
 1415495: if you read it signed also, should not create a problem, everyone now use 2 complement
 1415495: -128 -&gt; 127
 MSmits: whats 2 complement?
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: good to know, thanks
 1415495: it's always from - 2^(n-1) to 2^(n -1) - 1
 ddreams: and has -0 and +0 :p
 1415495: for integer, no
 1415495: as it's a 2 complement
 MSmits: I will just remember the negative part gets an extra 1 :P
 ddreams: right
 ddreams: 1's complement has signed zero
 Zorg1: or float ...
 ddreams: -127 to 127 and signed zero
 1415495: exact
 ddreams: Fall Challenge 2020
 ddreams: found the bug
 ddreams: was generating repeated casts as legal moves, but didn't apply the repeat when making the move
 Chainman: pewpepew
 Chainman: Finally the weekend :grinning:
 Chainman: why do I always get shortest mode in coc&#160;:(
 ddreams: rng jesus
 ogulcan_uygun: Hello everyone
 Chainman: hey
 struct: hi
 ddreams: Fall Challenge 2020Legend LeagueRank 1/499
 struct: small bugs
 Lyar: .
 ddreams: some kind of bug blindness.. small function which "obviously" is correct 
 ddreams: ended up at 59th... wonder how my contest code would have fared with just that bugfix
 ddreams: not beating gold boss with either the mcst or the bfs version
 Chainman: oh wow
 ddreams: the fall challenge was two weeks after I became a father, so I wasn't really able to compete, but always bothered me that nothing seemed to work
 ddreams: now I know, and can go to sleep with peace&#160;:)
 ddreams: gn
 Smelty: gn
 Smelty: well, good afternoon for m

 VizGhar: Hmm just figured out, I've nearly reinvented wheel (simulated annealing). Even cooling down :D (just not 100% correctly)
 VizGhar: Why is this algorithm so simple? I was expecting some mega bomb
 Alex-1: :smile:
 VizGhar: I should probably peek into NN now
 struct: I never tried SA
 struct: Maybe I should 
 struct: VizGhar where did you apply SA?
 voidnull: how old r you guys?
 Sirlamb: 42
 Sirlamb: 420
 nimnacke: 15
 Astrobytes: Old enough not to do the equivalent of a/s/l in every online social situation.
 jacek: that old eh
 jacek: ok boomer
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 struct: Astro I finished the mcts thing yesterday
 Astrobytes: Ah. Any improvements then?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: Got stats?
 jacek: mcts thing?
 struct: So it was on csb with smitsi
 struct: detph 6 search
 struct: 30000 plays of depth 6
 struct: so a total of 180000
 struct: Play is heavy though
 struct: I cant just time the node selection phase
 struct: I timed all game
 struct: Normal version took 54.1ms average with 718k selections calls
 struct: AVX took 43.9817ms average with same ammount of selections
 struct: jacek I did selection phase of mcts with avx
 Astrobytes: That's quite a speedup
 Marchete: you select 8 moves at the same time?
 struct: I calculate the best node child marchete
 jacek: UCT in avx?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: aka the one everyone tried to get working and couldn't
 struct: tbf I always have 8 childs because I didnt have a lot of time
 Marchete: I don't see it
 struct: it was just for test
 Marchete: I thought you were expanding 8 children at the same time
 Astrobytes: when is the submit then :P
 struct: no

 Marchete: ahhh
 struct: Astro, I dont know, Im still doing the other thing
 Astrobytes: Oh right, yeah
 struct: I will say again, I always had 8 moves possible, no more or less, so Im not sure how good it is.
 Marchete: gather is faster?
 struct: It was
 Astrobytes: Looks promising at least
 Marchete: _mm256_setr_epi32(0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28)
 Marchete: you create 3 equals
 struct: does it really create it everytime?
 struct: Does it not get optimized?
 Marchete: maybe or maybe not
 Marchete: at least that
 Marchete: _mm256_i32gather_ps(&amp;nodes[nodes[current].firstChildIndex].visits, _mm256_setr_epi32(0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28), 4))
 Marchete: won't be optimized
 Marchete: as array can change
 Marchete: I imagine
 struct: oh let me see&#160;:)
 struct: Thanks
 Marchete: check in godbolt
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: 40 sec now
 struct: so -3
 struct: oh wait no
 struct: its the same I think
 struct: I think it would be better if I tested where selection is really where its heavy
 struct: on csb its not that great to test with
 struct: I benchmarked it before localy and it was also better
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/gT2A0BD.png">https://i.imgur.com/gT2A0BD.png</a>
 Marchete: what's that benchmark?
 struct: It was just selection phase
 struct: of calculating 8 nodes
 struct: I tried also by having array of the params that the node had likefloat *visits = new float[1&lt;&lt;20];float *score = new float[1&lt;&lt;20];...
 struct: So I could try loadu
 struct: gather used normal Node structure
 struct: Node{float visits,score...
 GIPOKE: can i compress this?
 GIPOKE: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/60d1ac7b-6d32-4f96-a30f-dbcd6fd39635">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/60d1ac7b-6d32-4f96-a30f-dbcd6fd39635</a>
 GIPOKE: whats wrong with this?
 GIPOKE: const r = Math.abs(t);
 ConstantBolzmann: List&lt;t1,[t1-65]&gt;
 GIPOKE: i just want to find the absolute value of a number variable
 struct: what is the value of t GIPOKE?
 GIPOKE: a number
 GIPOKE: any number im solving a puzzle
 GIPOKE: any number  from -273 to 5526
 struct: Well nothing on your code is wrong
 GIPOKE: here
 struct: at least on the part you pasted
 Astrobytes: It's because it's js
 Astrobytes: That's what's wrong.
 GIPOKE: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bee0fa00-f182-4c20-950a-3c23a003f6e6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bee0fa00-f182-4c20-950a-3c23a003f6e6</a>
 GIPOKE: it says the value of r 'is not read'
 struct: because its out of scope
 struct: its inside {
 GIPOKE: ah
 Astrobytes: yep
 GIPOKE: but i only want to log it once
 Astrobytes: and?
 struct: you can declare it outisde the for loop
 GIPOKE: so i have to log it outside of the for loop
 struct: without being const
 GIPOKE: hmm
 Astrobytes: let r = 0 or something
 VizGhar: struct sorry I disappeared... I've used simple SA on A*Craft
 GIPOKE: and now it says t is not defined
 struct: np
 GIPOKE: so i have to bring t out too?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/12577d2b-a270-475f-8816-f9b5827a0844">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/12577d2b-a270-475f-8816-f9b5827a0844</a>
 GIPOKE: hmm ok
 Astrobytes: what did you do instead of what struct posted?
 GIPOKE: put const before the r
 waffenSS: does anyone have a link to the solution of this problem? Divisibility of Fibonacci numbers sum
 struct: nice viz ghar
 Astrobytes: that's why struct said lose the const and I said let r = 0;
 struct: I never tried a*craft
 GIPOKE: still doesnt work
 struct: the code I posted should work
 GIPOKE: waffenSS i could use that too
 struct: is just not the solution to the puzzle
 VizGhar: You can come it with 6k solution in and hour or so
 struct: you are a bit far from the solution
 GIPOKE: no the r is fine
 waffenSS: GIPOKE where did you get stuck? 
 VizGhar: But I was quite lucky with just a single bug on 300LoC in C++ hmm
 GIPOKE: im doing Temperatures puzzle
 GIPOKE: waffenSS at the beginning
 struct: GIPOKE you need to find the number closest to 0
 GIPOKE: the r is sensing line 1 of the input instead of line 2 hmm
 GIPOKE: i dont see whats wrong
 waffenSS: I've had no problem with the optimization i just got confused with the exact  fib number im looking for 
 VizGhar: GIPOKE imagine you are reading only one number and its -5... what would your output be?&#160;:)
 GIPOKE: are you looking at the puzzle?
 multii: hi
 GIPOKE: so the game input for testcase 1 is51 -2 -8 4 5
 GIPOKE: the one closest to zero is 1 so thats what it should output
 struct: yes
 struct: your current code will always print the last one
 GIPOKE: i make sure to find the absolute value for each number using r
 GIPOKE:&#160;? why?
 struct: But you dont do any comparison
 Astrobytes: ^
 GIPOKE: at the bottom i use Math.min()
 Astrobytes: on one value 
 GIPOKE: the for loop should run 5 times?
 GIPOKE: oh wait
 GIPOKE: thats where it went wrong
 Astrobytes: yes, so r will be 5
 VizGhar: ah. I should have read that more carefully... well JS is JS :D
 Astrobytes: you take the min of 5
 GIPOKE: ok i know the problem but im nowhere close to the solution
 GIPOKE: the things im thinking of do the exact same thing
 Astrobytes: You should think about comparing the numbers while you loop over them perhaps?
 GIPOKE:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Try doing it by hand
 struct: you read a number and compare it with the current
 struct: also i forgot to mention, if anyone tries the avx thing I would like to know if it also worked, I could have something wrong on my code, but I doubt it
 Astrobytes: Maybe marchete will
 Astrobytes: Also zarthy
 ZarthaxX: i just came here
 ZarthaxX: did you see me? lol
 Astrobytes: lmao, nah
 struct: Yes
 Astrobytes: Great timing
 struct: I get a notification everytime you get on
 ZarthaxX: hate u mods with your god eyes
 Astrobytes: *gods with our mod eyes
 ZarthaxX: very good timing
 struct: And then I have a script to write a sentence that contains the word AVX
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 ZarthaxX: what avx thing are you talking about
 ZarthaxX: :eyes:
 struct: I did selection for mcts on csb
 struct: to calculate the uct 
 struct: I always had 8 childs per node though, it was just for a quick test I was lazy
 struct: It completed the same number of plays 8-10 seconds faster
 ZarthaxX: oh nice
 struct: not seconds
 Astrobytes: ms
 ZarthaxX: still good 
 struct: yeah but also not a good thing to compare
 ZarthaxX: so what's the problem?
 struct: it was 53ms vs 43-44ms
 struct: so how much&#160;%?
 struct: 20% ish?
 ZarthaxX: yes
 struct: there is no problem ZarthaxX
 orangesnowfox: tfw everyone has moved on to MCTS and my CSB is still using GA :p
 Astrobytes: about that yes
 Astrobytes: orangesnowfox mine too, don't worry&#160;:)
 struct: Also selection is not the hotspot on that code
 struct: so, it should be above 20%
 ZarthaxX: okey
 struct: but if I did constant amount of iterations it should not change right?
 ZarthaxX: idk wdym by constant amount of iterations
 struct: The time the plays take
 ZarthaxX: iterations of what
 struct: of plays
 ZarthaxX: still dont get you
 struct: it was 180k plays
 ZarthaxX: okey
 struct: per turn
 ZarthaxX: you mean run the code 180k times
 ZarthaxX: it should give the same 20% gain?
 struct: yeah
 ZarthaxX: it should yes, as you had a good sample
 orangesnowfox: hahaha... I'm currently tuning my search race, there's... I feel like it should be able to do better than it does (the best I can manage seems to be depth=8 with 10 pop, while still having at least 4k generations). "Oh, the conversation has moved on already"
 struct: ZarthaxX you coding anything on cg?
 ZarthaxX: nope
 ZarthaxX: i wanted to do optims but well
 ZarthaxX: not now
 struct: save yourself for the contest
 struct: I hope its 8 player game
 Astrobytes: I wouldn't even enter the IDE never mind submit
 struct: Maybe optimization then
 orangesnowfox: 8 player sounds hard to code for... Like, nevermind the game itself, how do you handle 7 opponents?
 Astrobytes: 11 day optim contest? Would be over after 2 days
 struct: you dont
 struct: You just pray that rng helps you
 ZarthaxX: 8 players? are you crazy LMAO
 ZarthaxX: looks like 4 by the colors lol
 struct: I need to find those beta testers
 orangesnowfox: struct: given that I'm more of a 2 player game type person...
 VizGhar: I've made 8player multi. But dumped it&#160;:) 8 is too much... You need luck over everything else
 struct: This is why fb is the best game
 struct: Maybe I should try again
 orangesnowfox: Sounds stupid, like training a neural network on white noise (only) and expecting it to have any statistically significant results...
 orangesnowfox: * in the test dataset

 Astrobytes: it's me before I shaved a few weeks ago
 MSmits: cant you just take it off, seems like a fake stache
 Astrobytes: that's a Thinking 'stache
 MSmits: you mean it has AI&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Quite possible.
 MSmits: I see
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Should have known he german
 Astrobytes: Hm, 2 Nietzsche references in a week. I called ZarthaxX Zarthathustra the other day
 ZarthaxX: dude wtf
 Astrobytes: I did
 ZarthaxX: i just clicked CG tab after coming back to my house
 MSmits: thats what you said last time
 ZarthaxX: and you just tag me
 Astrobytes: lol, we're synchronised today dude
 ZarthaxX: scary asf
 ZarthaxX: dad sync :D
 struct: avx
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 ZarthaxX: stahp HAHAHA
 MSmits: this is when most noobs think: "what weird corner of the internetz is this?"
 Astrobytes: And regulars probably too
 struct: MSmits the csb thing was 20% faster
 MSmits: you mean the selection with avx?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: awesome
 struct: But I always had 8 childs
 MSmits: mmh
 struct: I will test with some other game soon
 MSmits: thats not typical for when i use selection
 PatrickMcGinnisII: some of these convos need an .onion wrapper rofl
 Astrobytes: lol
 checkmunza: can i select a mode that i want?
 jacek: that nietzche thing, is this Baader-Meinhof phenomenon?
 struct: Only for private clashes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the weather is so nice, going to friend's pool... why am i on here?
 checkmunza: thanks
 Astrobytes: lol jacek, possibly
 MSmits: because it's more fun than some pool?
 MSmits: unless you're playing pool
 Astrobytes: pool? He said modes not nodes :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Gotta wash the Zarthathustra off
 MSmits: i was responding to PatrickMcGinnisII :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: I know, just thought I'd chuck it in there. Into the pool.
 MSmits: aha
 jacek: nodes pool?
 Astrobytes: half an hour later, in comes jacek
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just finished getting the checkers minmax setup, i'll test it later but I think I can get only 40k nodes
 jacek: pool is loop reversed :scream_cat:
 jacek: nodes in minimax?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I started setting up a static node pool to prevent GC in php from slowing it down
 MSmits: jacek, even worse, if you drop the l, you get poo!
 Astrobytes: Wait a second, you store minimax nodes?
 MSmits: thats weird
 jacek: thats probably normal in php
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just make a board state string of 32 characters
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 MSmits: but why store the nodes&#160;?
 MSmits: cant you just do the regular recursive version?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: worked recently for Oware Obapa, i got 20k more board states for a depth of only 6
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Php runs garbage collection and messes up the clock
 Astrobytes: It's not a tree you store though
 MSmits: yes but, if you do a normal minimax, there is no garbage basically
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i can get 130k states in Obapa
 jacek: php is garbage *
 MSmits: in minimax you only have 1 state at a time
 MSmits: you dont store anything
 MSmits: well maybe with transpositions, but no point doing those in most cases, certainly not with php
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the board state array is linear....oh I'm iterative deepening
 MSmits: of course
 MSmits: as you should
 MSmits: still no need to store
 Astrobytes: board state array? Why?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cloning classes in expensive
 MSmits: dont clone anything
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er objects
 MSmits: oh wait
 MSmits: its oware
 MSmits: so yeah just keep the parent version
 MSmits: to restore
 jacek: did you climb in ranks in oware or checkers then?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I did gain in Oware
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gained 50 spots
 jacek: noice
 PatrickMcGinnisII: next is checkers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: could only get approx 125k states in oware
 PatrickMcGinnisII: estimating 40k in checkers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall kill me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i know it
 MSmits: checkers is not much slower than oware  i think?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so, yea node pool
 MSmits: oware has an expensive move application
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well if have to king, and you have multiple jumps
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah, oware is easy
 MSmits: but that doesnt happen every time
 MSmits: easy doesnt mean fast
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oware is max 6 moves per depth, checkers can go up to 11 i think
 MSmits: thats true but you said states
 MSmits: more branching doesnt mean you can keep less states
 MSmits: it just means you get less depth
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think we are thinking of states differently, its ok  ... I'm just filling up more of the pool these days by using static constructs
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: Your board state is a string for oware you said Patrick?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no checkers
 Astrobytes: what about oware?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: still using int array for oware
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only 12 ints
 Astrobytes: I use an array too
 Astrobytes: just copy the array
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but php uses a minimum of 4 bytes for each int
 MSmits: ack 32 bits when you only need 5
 MSmits: well maybe 6
 Astrobytes: Have you tried it this way though?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, easy to clone/copy board for child
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rzanked 71 in checkers using a 2dim array...coverting to linear string should bump me up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, i got bored
 jacek: eval the same?
 MSmits: you should train a NN locally and dont even perform a search on your turn, just run the nn 1 time
 MSmits: it will do better
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sorry I shared my stoneage optimizations, lol
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: I was trying to resist the temptation to tell you to switch to C again, but I can't. Switch to C!
 Astrobytes: (for multis)
 MSmits: or rust, or c++, or C# or even ja... no i cant
 jacek: jacek?
 MSmits: :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, yes i have to rewrite bots to stay in top 500 in CP
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops, gotta dress my kid for pool, afk
 Smelty: o.o
 Astrobytes: cya later
 MSmits: thats weird, i thought people undressed for water. Been a while for me though
 MSmits: hf
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Roxxx: lol
 RB8686: Anyone here ever had to use this platform for a job interview?
 MSmits: not me
 Roxxx: guys i'm playing coding wondev woman AI and this is the second game in a row where i'm stuck at rank 1 in wood 1 but still not advancing 
 MSmits: are you being interviewed
 RB8686: It's pat of my job interview, a technical test
 MSmits: Roxxx thats a pretty old game. Not very many active players. What are you using to solve it?
 jacek: Roxxx try resubmiting to arena
 Astrobytes: Thought you were doing CSB Roxxx?
 jacek: nothign beats good old spam resubmits
 MSmits: RB8686 ah, well just try to solve the puzzle, whatever it is
 Roxxx: yeah i was doing CSB, now i took a little break to try something different without velocities xD
 RB8686: Yeah which is a little worrying, I had 8 weeks of Python and can't solve a single game
 MSmits: game?
 MSmits: are you trying puzzles?
 MSmits: like thor?
 MSmits: or the descent?
 RB8686: yes
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: well it takes a while to get the hang of things
 Roxxx: @MSmits, i'm using a ton of stuff if you are interested i can send you my code on Discord
 MSmits: temperatures is also a good one to try
 MSmits: no thats ok Roxxx, I am guessing it's mostly heuristics right? No search with simulations yt?
 MSmits: yet
 RB8686: I'm a cyber sec student, so I already know where to find all the solutions, but that would be cheating
 MSmits: sure
 RB8686: I'll try temperatures then
 MSmits: try doing it testcase by testcase, no need to solve all at once
 Astrobytes: Hm. There used to be an intro example on CG for Work but I can't find it RB8686
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes my kid broke her hip 2 years ago, so I like waite on her like 24-7... single father stuff.
 RB8686: Alright thanks
 Roxxx: @MSmits im storing all the possible moves and then chosing the unit and the move based on multiple conditions
 MSmits: oh thats horrible PatrickMcGinnisII, sorry to hear that
 Astrobytes: Doing puzzles should be enough
 MSmits: have a daughter that need a lot of help too, but nothing physical like that
 Astrobytes: That's crap Patrick. Good to know she's got an on-point dad looking after her (even if he uses PHP :P )
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rofl
 Roxxx: i have highest priority on the jumping to the height of 3 to get a point, if that's not avaliable then i see if i can push, and if that's not avaliable too then i move to the field with highest build possibilities
 MSmits: yeah just because you use php, doesnt meant you cant be a great dad
 jacek: thats kid abuse
 Astrobytes: Only if you make them learn it jacek
 MSmits: she might occasionally see his screen and be scarred for life
 MSmits: Roxxx makes sense to do stuff like that
 MSmits: good way to get out of wood
 Roxxx: but im still in wood rofl
 MSmits: i mean, its good to try heuristics like that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2 more surgeries left to go still...smh my kid still has attitude.... dad sync
 MSmits: you might not have hit upon the best one
 Astrobytes: as jacek mentioned, since it's not that active a game it might take a couple of submits
 Roxxx: @MSmits any suggestions what i should change?
 MSmits: i havent gotten into wondev woman  that far, but let me see what i did 
 Astrobytes: that sucks Patrick, great she's still got attitude though! They're supposed to have that :D
 aetrnm: Hey, good afternoon
 MSmits: oh seems i made silver
 aetrnm: If I am creating CoC reverse, should I still write Statement and Description part?
 Roxxx: @MSmits what language are you using?
 MSmits: Roxxx I think I gave each action a score and just picked the best one
 MSmits: my current version, which is 3 yrs old, is C#. If i were to start it seriously i would be using c++ for speed
 Astrobytes: Don't think so aetrnm
 Astrobytes: But I don't clash so, anyone else?
 Roxxx: i have an idea, does anyone want to start building solutions for any game together in java?
 Roxxx: i think i need a coding buddy to progress
 aetrnm: I am only clashing, lmao
 Astrobytes: jacek, help Roxxx
 Astrobytes: Maybe post on discord. I know a few people occasionally do pair coding, even euler sometimes
 Roxxx: @MSmits, what data structure are you using for that
 Roxxx: @Astrobytes will do&#160;:)
 MSmits: eh i barely understand it now, but let me paste it
 jacek: huh

 struct: no bitboards :scream:
 MSmits: more would be giving too much away\
 MSmits: i didnt even know what a bitboard was back then
 jacek: ahh the big bang?
 Astrobytes: WW seems annoying to bitboard
 jacek: those were good times
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: lol
 Smelty: :rofl:
 Roxxx: @MSmits all i get from those links is "404 page not found"
 Astrobytes: Really? Works fine for me
 MSmits: i think your browser is protecting you from poorly written C# code
 Roxxx: i tried clicking on some pastebins yesterday too, same thing
 Astrobytes: Hm. Prepare to be underwhelmed!<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/01FUnXxr">https://pastebin.com/01FUnXxr</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wth
 Astrobytes: I know, it's not PHP
 Smelty: me cat
 PatrickMcGinnisII: (abs(x-nx)&lt;=1)&amp;&amp;(abs(y-ny)&lt;=1)  no?
 Astrobytes: not my code... Blame Early Smits
 MSmits: yeah i dont know what the guy was thinking
 MSmits: early Smits I mean
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lets find a way to make it confusing
 MSmits: you do that :P I need to go get some food
 Smelty: hmm
 MSmits: ttyl
 Smelty: ok
 Roxxx: @Astrobytes, yeah i can read that one
 Roxxx: wtf, that's all you need to get to silver?
 Astrobytes: awesome
 PatrickMcGinnisII: (abs(x-nx)&lt;=&gt;1), ok i give up
 Roxxx: i might have overcomplicated it too much
 Roxxx: xD
 Smelty: xD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok tacos and splish splash, cya
 Astrobytes: later Patrick
 Roxxx: @MSmits, thanks for your code
 Astrobytes: Roxxx: well, you still need to write an eval function
 Roxxx: yeah ofc
 Smelty: yea
 Roxxx: i did make a Cell class
 Astrobytes: iirc looking at the surrounding squares and checking their heights, whether you're next to a hole etc was useful
 Roxxx: but i didn't think of making an Action class
 Astrobytes: Yeah, easier to score them that way
 Smelty: hmm wondev women
 Roxxx: if anyone wants to take a look at my code and give any constructive criticism i'd appreciate it very much
 Astrobytes: MSmits will do it
 Roxxx: after that i think i might have to start from scratch
 Smelty: I'm looking at the input...
 Smelty: oh god so many variables
 Astrobytes: jacek
 Astrobytes: so many variables? Have you seen code royale?
 Smelty: nope..
 Smelty: the yellow is killing my eyes however
 Roxxx: here's my full code
 Roxxx: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/MQ4VSUB5">https://pastebin.com/MQ4VSUB5</a>
 Smelty: oo
 Smelty: java?
 Smelty: i see&#160;:
 Smelty: I'm still kind of a noob at most of these multiplayer games&#160;:(
 Smelty: interesting strategy of yours, you don't instantly move to higher stages
 Astrobytes: Nothing particularly wrong there, refactoring with an added Action class would help simplify things I think
 Smelty: true
 ConstantBolzmann: "Hey, how am I going to solve my difficult problems?i will create many classes and attach them)"
 Smelty: hmm
 Astrobytes: lol, I think in this case it is justified
 Smelty: yea
 Smelty: dang, roxxx, you're so close to getting out of wood
 Astrobytes: Did you try a resubmit Roxxx?
 Smelty: o.O
 MadKnight: less than 2 weeks....
 Smelty: lol got sealed into a corner <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/t1DVLG.jpg">https://snipboard.io/t1DVLG.jpg</a>
 Astrobytes: ...less than 2 weeks to Scottish local elections, it's true
 Smelty: ...and codingame contest
 Astrobytes: yeah, bad move Smelty :P
 Astrobytes: And yes, I know!
 Smelty: *cries in dumb*
 <b>**Smelty commits seppuku to attone</b></p><p><img src="/a/62550867880972" /> Roxxx: sorry i was cooking
 Roxxx: @Astrobytes yeah i tried resubmitting
 Smelty: try, try again
 Smelty: after all, you're less than a single point away
 Astrobytes: How much difference between you and the boss?
 Smelty: boss is 30.37, roxxx is 29.31
 Smelty: so really close
 Astrobytes: Ah. Winrate against boss?
 Smelty: i just checked leaderboard
 Astrobytes: (roughly)
 Smelty: idk how points are calculated&#160;:(
 Roxxx: i started another arena simulation, fingers crossed
 Roxxx: i made my units a bit more aggressive
 Smelty: o.O
 Roxxx: prioritizing push over everything else
 Smelty: hmmm....
 Astrobytes: Sometimes it's just a case of bringing the boss down a few points if he's been pushed up
 Smelty: true
 Smelty: just keep fightin the boss
 Astrobytes: Depends on your winrate against it
 Smelty: with good code
 Smelty: roxxx push go brrr <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/542823528">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/542823528</a>
 Roxxx: loooool
 Smelty: it does seem to work
 Smelty: also consider blocking off your opponent's point generators if possible
 Roxxx: how would i do that
 Smelty: like if they are just farming two points and yours happens to be close, block it off
 Smelty: ...idk lol
 Roxxx: yeah but how would i incorporate that into my code logic
 Roxxx: i think i need to start from scratch
 Roxxx: with an action class and a point system for actions
 Smelty: i guess
 Astrobytes: Not from scratch, just refactor it
 Smelty: also, I just submitted a copy-code of the one you posted so you can test your new versions against it if you wish
 Roxxx: thanks 
 Roxxx: @Smelty, do you do java as well?
 jacek: he can do copy-paste java
 Roxxx: lolz
 Smelty: lolll
 Smelty: but yes I do some java
 Smelty: :coffee:
 Roxxx: @jacek, do you wanna be coding buddies at a game of your choice, i hear you do java
 Smelty: o.O
 Smelty: wait a sec roxxx
 Smelty: my submission of your ai just went above the boss
 Smelty: try resubmitting
 Roxxx: ROFL
 Smelty: its above by over a point wth
 Roxxx: did you get promoted?
 Smelty: not yet
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: I think you just have to get lucky-
 Astrobytes: This is what I've been trying to tell you. You just need to spam a few submits to pull down the boss in older multis
 jacek: Roxxx nah, on CG im using c++ and i suck at pair programming
 Smelty: e........im in bronze now
 jacek: noob
 Roxxx: @Smelty, congrats! rofl
 Smelty: "how to get demote"

 Astrobytes: Did you reset with the reset button
 Smelty: because it says its already reset
 Smelty: yes I did
 Astrobytes: refresh it?
 Roxxx: type some random stuff then try to reset again
 Smelty: okay
 Smelty: it works now :0
 Roxxx: btw @Smelty, are there any new rules in bronze?
 Smelty: it says:
 Smelty: You're only able to see enemy nits adjacent to one of yours."
 Smelty: *units
 Roxxx: right, so no major change for my code
 Smelty: yep
 Astrobytes: Was gonna say. Didn't think there were any headlice in WW
 struct: bronze rule is fog of war
 Astrobytes: (enemy nits)
 Smelty: (ow)
 KiwiTae: Which multi are u doing? :D
 Roxxx: HOLD ON I'm above the boss, but it's still simulating
 Smelty: :00000
 Smelty: you got this robot
 KiwiTae: can i join im bored
 struct: he is doing wondev woman
 KiwiTae: aah
 Smelty: (wondev womAn)
 Roxxx: @KiwiTae, Wondev Woman
 KiwiTae: im in silver in that one i think
 Smelty: p/p

 Roxxx: I MADE IT WOOO, thanks guys
 Smelty: yay
 KiwiTae: gg
 Roxxx: @KiwiTae, what language are you using?

 Roxxx: might be a temporary bug
 KiwiTae: just trying each moves 
 Smelty: probably because you just promoted
 KiwiTae: looks like i started sim and never finished
 Smelty: interestin
 KiwiTae: Smelty u change your avi!!
 KiwiTae: :D
 Smelty:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: It's just the transition between wood and bronze
 Smelty: I think it is more realistic representation of me
 jacek: :3
 Smelty: p.s. I just submitted dysfuntional code to bronze and I have a 50% win rate judging from last battles xD
 Roxxx: where can you see your winrate?
 Smelty: I just scrolled down from last battles, and looked at the amount of wins I had compared to battles
 Roxxx: aah, so approx
 Smelty: yep
 Astrobytes: normally on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com</a> but you need to be up a few leagues 
 Astrobytes: Otherwise do as Smelty did
 Smelty: ah, you have to be top 1000
 Smelty: *above the first 1000
 Smelty: so in this case, top 200 or so
 Roxxx: if you are above the first 1000 then you are first? no? xD
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: "Error 404. Player not found. Double check your nickname and the selected puzzle. Please note that cgstats can't find your ranking if you are above the first 1000 players. If you think cgstats should find you and this is an error, try to ask Magus."
 Smelty: wait wh-
 Smelty: does it mean that if my ranking is past the first 1000 I can't be found?
 Roxxx: paradox
 Astrobytes: Yes, Below top 1000 will not be found
 Smelty: but it sa-
 jacek: ask Magus
 Smelty: ohhh
 Astrobytes: Look, it's a French site. Some stuff translates poorly into English.
 Smelty: it means if your ranking is "above" 1000
 Smelty: meaning 1001 is above
 KiwiTae: above in better than
 Smelty: and 999 is like below
 KiwiTae: maybe
 <b>**Smelty is confused af</b></p><p><img src="/a/62550867880972" /> Roxxx: i think it's just a typo, it should say below

 Gumarkamole: mb how many bits
 nipun18058: me too @smelty
 Astrobytes: Well yeah. . . but you know, the pattern. . . it's the solution to the problem.
 AntiSquid: astro when is miniraic&#160;? doubt i'll do it but curious
 nipun18058: @astrobytes if u know the pattern then why u didn't tell me
 Astrobytes: Donno yet AntiSquid, but they said it was gonna happen
 struct: whats miniraic?
 Smelty: also nipun
 Astrobytes: Shorter RAIC 
 Smelty: isnt it something over 7
 Smelty: or something
 Smelty: after all 3/7 is 0.42
 Smelty: and 1/7 is 0/1
 Smelty: *0.1
 nipun18058: how?....5/7 is 0.41 which is not equal to 32
 Smelty: and  2147483647/7 is roughly 31
 Smelty: true
 nipun18058: but yeah divisible by 7 is something pattern
 Smelty: 31/7 rounded up is 5
 Smelty: and 32/7 idk
 Smelty: welp
 Astrobytes: struct: Like an early/mid year RAIC in between the main ones
 nipun18058: @Leonidfedorrussianpride whats the pattern?...i saw u got 100%

 UnnamedCodinGamer: if I only provide angle input for the same path

 goulashsoup: Programming PHP - Mime Type Puzzle: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/efa03e30-7024-4f7f-a9a9-61e2604c1fb7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/efa03e30-7024-4f7f-a9a9-61e2604c1fb7</a>
 goulashsoup: PHP: Input should be ASCII encoced- Using fgets() gets me the line including the line-break, but stream_get_line() gets multiple lines at once.
 goulashsoup: Does anyone know why that ist?
 Astrobytes: It's because PHP
 goulashsoup: Oh, So funny HAHA....
 Astrobytes: Calm down man it's just a joke, we always rib the php'ers on here
 UnnamedCodinGamer: struct, yes it is for both inputs
 Astrobytes: goulashsoup: it doesn't
 Astrobytes: After     $FNAME = stream_get_line(STDIN, 256 + 1, "\n");// One file name per line.
 Astrobytes: Do:    echo($FNAME);
 Astrobytes: The input is read in lines separated with "\n"
 Astrobytes: Hence the last parameter of stream_get_line
 Astrobytes: So you want to store every time the line is read
 goulashsoup: &gt; This function is nearly identical to fgets() except in that it allows end of line delimiters other than the standard \n, \r, and \r\n, and does not return the delimiter itself.
 Astrobytes: Yes, you don't get the newline
 Smelty: i.i
 Astrobytes: You get the input
 Astrobytes: So store that and deal with the newlines when you have to
 goulashsoup: Therefor i would have thought the last parameter would NOT be necessary, rikght?
 Astrobytes: No
 Astrobytes: It allows delimiters other than, not just something by default
 Astrobytes: And does not return the delimiter
 Astrobytes: Why do you care if the last parameter is necessary anyway?
 Astrobytes: It's completely separate from the problem you're attempting to solve
 goulashsoup: So, it allows other delimiters, but does not handle them like fgets, so it does not return when a EOL is detected?
 Astrobytes: It will not return the delimiter. EOL, EOF, tab, whatever is specified. It will return the data in between the delimiters
 goulashsoup: Right, but i have the problem that line break is not detected as EOL.
 goulashsoup: Or is a line break not an EOL character?
 Astrobytes: "\n"
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d6462c9-bf7b-4ccc-afb7-d70d473a5bc3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d6462c9-bf7b-4ccc-afb7-d70d473a5bc3</a>
 Astrobytes: works fine for me
 Astrobytes: Not sure what you are doing but you just need to store what you get from $FNAME and work with that
 goulashsoup: I get it, but "\n" shoudn't be necessary according to the docs. and if it isn't either their is a bug, or the doc is wrong or i misunderstood the function and how it handles different characters... 
 Astrobytes: delete the "\n" parameter
 Astrobytes: And run the code
 goulashsoup: I'll do that, THANKS&#160;!
 Astrobytes: It still works
 goulashsoup: OK, then it must be a code error on my site, i'll look into it...
 Astrobytes: Don't worry too much about the default code unless it doesn't work, in that case there is an issue
 Astrobytes:     $FNAME = stream_get_line(STDIN, 256 + 1);// One file name per line.
 Astrobytes: works perfectly
 Astrobytes: (obviously you don't need those 2 echoes but for debug purposes obvs)
 goulashsoup: Thanks for your help, i come back to it later...
 Astrobytes: No worries

 Astrobytes: Get physics-y, math-y, or read <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html</a> and write yourself a little simulation and search algo
 WannaBeHum1n: i love phisicy
 Astrobytes: You can (or used to be able to) get legend with just maths/physics formulas and such
 WannaBeHum1n: thnx sir
 Astrobytes: But, from experience, simulation + some search algorithm is easier :DYour mileage may vary!
 WannaBeHum1n: search algorithms
 WannaBeHum1n: yh
 WannaBeHum1n: i ll google that
 Astrobytes: check the magu s article I linked, it explains fairly well the steps of a rolling horizon genetic algo
 orangesnowfox: Hmm, so it isn't worthwhile in csb, but in searchrace would it be worth keeping solutions from the previous turn + new random ending?
 orangesnowfox: ... I *could* just try this, instead of asking
 Astrobytes: What do you mean exactly?
 Astrobytes: Totally randomising the last depth of your search?
 Astrobytes: Oh no, I see what you mean
 Astrobytes: Haven't tried that but I don't see how it would provide much benefit?
 Astrobytes: More so than CSB for sure but I think the gain would be negligible, it's not like reusing an MCTS tree
 orangesnowfox: The theory is that it would allow me to use deeper depths, and still come up with decent solutions
 orangesnowfox: but, I don't know until I've tried it, I guess
 struct: Well the entire state would have to be equal
 Uljahn: it doesn't help with the horizon effect
 Astrobytes: ^^^^
 orangesnowfox: mm, yeah...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^ ^^^ ^ I think anything over depth 9 is a waste anyways
 orangesnowfox: we're still talking about search race?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: could give you a prune range to go deeper in a GA, pfft ewtf do i know...I'm wet and smell like chlorine
 Astrobytes: And PHP
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: ah search race
 struct: I thought it was csb
 orangesnowfox: hahaha... Yeah, in CSB this would be more than worthless
 Astrobytes: I still don't think it would provide much benefit but please do try it out!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there it is... smh astro
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII &lt;3
 orangesnowfox: yeah... I'm honestly getting to the point where I'm wondering "how are people getting the last 1.1k units of time shaved off"
 AntiSquid: yes small performance boost if you keep the tree duh
 Astrobytes: Well, you could just take the validators and do it offline :P
 AntiSquid: search race validators are available&#160;?
 Astrobytes: On the repo yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I thought this was the point
 orangesnowfox: I'd rather have the best solution online play can do than one of the many that does offline
 AntiSquid: there is&#160;!! you learn to automate stuff lol
 AntiSquid: and multi-task, because you do something else meanwhile
 orangesnowfox: lol, I have enough machine learning projects that I leave running in the background already
 Astrobytes: Of course there is learning involved. You still code an algorithm to maximise your score
 Astrobytes: Doesn't need to be ML
 AntiSquid: woah, the AI overlord, what do you have running in the background apart from skynet.exe&#160;? orangesnowfox
 UnnamedCodinGamer: actually for optimization games it makes sense to be able to solve offline
 orangesnowfox: Umm, "bump my GA up to 600 depth" would probably work to some degree...
 AntiSquid: a good generalizing algo is hard
 orangesnowfox: mhm
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN still has speech impediment 
 AntiSquid: ah bot is dead&#160;? Automaton2000
 orangesnowfox: lol
 Automaton2000: i use an external editor
 AntiSquid: did euler ban it or something&#160;?
 AntiSquid: sneaky 
 Astrobytes: No, NN won't start because (iirc) soem API change
 Astrobytes: *some
 struct: Automaton2000 was always the better one anyways
 Automaton2000: they will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 AntiSquid: old Automaton2000 was better, this is a weaker dumber version
 Automaton2000: the only reason for me to find a place to be
 AntiSquid: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton20( â€¢ ) ( â€¢ )Ô…(â€¾âŒ£â€¾Ô…)
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: convert all 0s, it has 3 nipples
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Automaton2( â€¢ ) ( â€¢ ) ( â€¢ )Ô…(oÔ…)
 Astrobytes: struct: did you fix the Amazons rank issue?
 struct: ah sorry, not yet
 struct: ill do it now
 Astrobytes: Cool, just wondering. 
 struct: The other thing kept me busy
 Astrobytes: Of course, not an issue at all
 AntiSquid: "conspiracy number search" - what a fun sounding algo :D
 AntiSquid: midnight ... goodnight, i am dropping 
 struct: gn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :part_alternation_mark:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cya
 orangesnowfox: gn squid
 Astrobytes: gn squiddo
 struct: Does brutaltester works with openjdk?
 Astrobytes: I genuinely have no idea
 orangesnowfox: re:stashing the population between turns, that has helped... a lot more than I want to admit honestly
 orangesnowfox: 82.7 -&gt;80.92 on test 1, seems to save 1 to 4 turns depending on the map, also decreases variance a lot, which is nice
 Astrobytes: Interesting
 orangesnowfox: ... I *do* wonder if it allows me to skip the randomization starting from the second GA turn (turn 3, I always go straight towards the first checkpoint on turn 1)
 orangesnowfox: although, it would be nice if I had something to randomize the *end* of the moveset, in that case
 orangesnowfox: rather than just mutate it
 Astrobytes: sure, just mutate the saved one rather than randomise. End of the moveset - hmm. experiment with it
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I am mega-screen-tired. Gonna watch a film and sleep
 Bobbadillio: huh, just realized I got to codingame looking for homework help :D
 struct: gn
 orangesnowfox: Astrobytes, yeah, sleep is good
 Bobbadillio: "How does MPI work?" "Here's a link!" "Wait, I'm not doing competitive programming right now, why am I on this site?!"
 Astrobytes: gn struct, orangesnowfox
 Bobbadillio: gn folks!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :cat:zzz
 <b>**orangesnowfox screams in random timeouts despite only using 41 of my allotted 50 ms</b></p><p><img src="/a/17617755701518" /> orangesnowfox: *sigh*
 Bobbadillio: is this the fairly "standard" thing where the clock starts running at some point in your turn nobody expects?
 orangesnowfox: Well, this is an optimization game, the timer is a lot looser with multis
 Bobbadillio: ah, sure
 struct: you should start the timer after reading the first input
 orangesnowfox: I suppose that might technically help a little, but, I'm using C++ and reading all the inputs in a single cin chain...
 orangesnowfox: I could at least see about disabling syncing between cstdio and C++ io
 orangesnowfox: Huh, so the amount of performance I gain is dependent on depth, interesting... (I gained free perf by increasing depth, despite dropping 1ms of total search time to get the submit to work)
 orangesnowfox: and by "the amount of performance I gain" I mean from the caching
 Smelty: yes
 Roxxx: random question is there a keyboard shortcut to properly indent the code
 Roxxx: like ctrl + shift + L does in idea, and android studio
 King_Coda: just watched the first two lord of the rings
 King_Coda: watching #3 tomorrow
 King_Coda: anyways
 Smelty: hi roxxx
 Roxxx: hey mate
 Smelty: :0
 Smelty: sorry, I don't know the answer to your question
 Smelty: maybe this will help? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://help.codingame.com/article/272-default-keyboard-shortcuts">https://help.codingame.com/article/272-default-keyboard-shortcuts</a>
 Roxxx: lolz no worries what's up, what are you up to
 Smelty: nothing :p
 Smelty: how about you
 Smelty: maybe the key is shift+alt+.
 Smelty: nevermind
 Roxxx: alt + F4 solves everything xD
 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: le trolleth
 Roxxx: i started coding with AntiSquid, we brainstormed for a good part of the evening, and now i'm trying to implement what we talked about 
 Roxxx: in Cultist Wars
 Smelty: nice!
 Roxxx: im about to shut down tho, pretty tired
 Roxxx: and you were right, the shortcut is shift + alt + F
 Roxxx: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf">https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf</a>
 Roxxx: thanks for the link
 Roxxx: i really missed that feature xD
 Smelty: no problem&#160;:)
 Smelty: lol
 Roxxx: well that's it for me today, off to dreamland
 Roxxx: take care, cya tmrw&#160;:)

 struct: triple wind is even worse than 2
 eulerscheZahl: my only hope is to distract the attacker long enough so that some spiders will find their way into the base
 HoriMiyamura: yeah, I do that too
 HoriMiyamura: I see a lot of 2/3atts, doesn't code anything good, just do the same all the way, and they are in top gold or low legend
 HoriMiyamura: that impacts other players
 Waffle3z: herd opponent heroes into the corner of their own base and lock them there using wind, then any spiders that get near get blown directly into the base
 Waffle3z: until they shield themselves and get out
 HoriMiyamura: it's not like that
 HoriMiyamura: wind stacking is like a shootgun
 HoriMiyamura: and bang -&gt; you lost
 Tuo: quick question: if i control a monster that will step in my base next turn, will it walk out?
 struct: it gets a random diredciton
 struct: direction*
 Tuo: like wind?
 HoriMiyamura: no
 HoriMiyamura: if u mean get the monster to out of base_attraction
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Tuo it mixes vectors, it could end up inside base, if it does it goes back to base
 HoriMiyamura: it will keep the speed vector
 Miki09: What is the dist where you see in fog?
 struct: 2200
 Miki09: ok thx
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my defense sucks
 Tuo: but the speed vector will be my control, and that will get it of my base
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tuo it will add the current vx,vy and the new vx vy for the result x,y
 Tuo: it steps in and next turn control applies and it gets out?
 Miki09: Any 2200 is radius of your view circle or diameter?
 HoriMiyamura: ok: if it is in the base after control-&gt; it will use the speed that direct to base center
 struct: radius
 Miki09: ok thx
 HoriMiyamura: if it is out of 5000, it keep your speed vector 
 HoriMiyamura: that's all
 Tuo: ah its like take base casts another control on it?
 HoriMiyamura: the rule is that: if the monster is in the base 5000, it will always get same attraction
 Tuo: after the turn
 Tuo: but control and step happen before
 HoriMiyamura: yeah. if it is not im[acting by wind/control
 HoriMiyamura: I think you could read source code of the game
 HoriMiyamura: to see what's happened
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/760e72039b4150871cd741639ee2c4cc947d360d/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L264">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/760e72039b4150871cd741639ee2c4cc947d360d/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L264</a>
 Tuo: not so quick question :D ty guys
 MrBamboo: Is it possible to cast "CONTROL" on a spider&#160;?
 struct: yes
 MrBamboo: I try but I always have "Bad command"
 MrBamboo: is that right&#160;?:"CONTROL 14 15130 6500"
 struct: SPELL CONTROL ID X Y
 MrBamboo: OOOOOOOOHHH 
 MrBamboo: Miss the SPELL ... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 MrBamboo: Hahaha thanks&#160;!
 struct: yw
 struct: So hiding already stated
 struct: started*
 struct: The person I was copying broke the bot :p
 yhyoxx: control enemy when he's shielded&#160;: windont control when shielded: lose ...
 Tuo: its fairly random even with deterministic bots
 Tuo: the game in general
 Tuo: thats why the run in arena fail to get correct rank
 Tuo: i have gone 150 -&gt; 50 rank just by waiting in league
 HoriMiyamura: it might be because those above you get promoted
 HoriMiyamura: but yes, the promoted behavior is weird
 HoriMiyamura: you just need to sit there and promoted
 Tuo: i think the algorithm is not good with close to 50/50 matches and low runs
 HoriMiyamura: the point is this: if ever in lucky the bot has higher than the boss score =&gt; it will get promoted, even though it is just lucky
 HoriMiyamura: I should for the more eval instead
 HoriMiyamura: but it isn't
 yhyoxx: not luck 
 yhyoxx: maybe luck if you're very close to the boss's score
 yhyoxx: and boss score lowers
 Miki09: Added HUGE code, time to test...
 Waffle3z: wonder how effective this is. gather 90 mana, then group your heroes and walk back and forth 300+6600-1280=5620 units from the opponent's base. any time a spider comes within wind range, almost guaranteed life for 30 mana. if it happens 3 times before you die you win
 Waffle3z: if you're interrupted by having your heroes blown or controlled so they're out of sync, or if the opponent happens to wind the same spider you're trying to, it fails and you have to farm to try again and you'll probably lose because you're not defending at all
 Miki09: But for some people it works
 Miki09: Imma implement it now. Thanks you Waffle3z&#160;:-)
 Miki09: *Thank you
 EvModder: well i'm done with the contest; considering how little spare time i had, i think im satisfied with my result
 Miki09: The mana at the end O.O <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/630054337">https://www.codingame.com/replay/630054337</a>

 struct: im out
 struct: cant even look at the screen anymore
 struct: gn every1
 EvModder: gn struct
 EvModder: c u next contest
 Miki09: gn
 yhyoxx: gn
 Tuo: Walffle3z you can also collect a bit more mana and send spiders to be shippedlike so with 2 hero attack <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/630038938">https://www.codingame.com/replay/630038938</a>

 Miki09: Im trying to use 3 def but I have millions of bugs...
 Miki09: *3 att
 Waffle3z: look at frame 48 and then ask if it looks like I'm about to win
 Waffle3z: submitting this, probably going to be worse but it's cool when it works
 Waffle3z: it doesn't even beat boss 5 half the time
 Miki09: lets see
 Miki09: looks good
 Miki09: 14% battles #1278
 Waffle3z: this was a meme strat but maybe if it can plan better then it could be strong
 Miki09: What place r u now?
 Waffle3z: 42% 590
 Miki09: hmm
 Waffle3z: keeping 1 defender might also make it much stronger, the 2 attackers just have to be closer to the base and be smarter about directing monsters to line up for the shot
 Bernard_Lowe: I'd agree with that. 2 attackers feels just about as difficult as 3 attackers, but they have some defense.
 Miki09: not as good as yours but I'm making progress: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/630094595">https://www.codingame.com/replay/630094595</a>

 Miki09: Could be worse...
 yhyoxx: do you lose mana when you fail a spell&#160;? like control a shielded unit
 KillerB37: Hi everyone&#160;!
 KillerB37: In the mod pod racing I don't know the meaning and thus how to manage the collides. 
 Zandy156: yhyoxx "Using a spell against a shielded entity still costs mana."
 Zandy156: I'm unsure about other cases
 yhyoxx: thanks 
 CrazyGamer: yes
 PRO_G_r_AM_m_ER: I messed up my attacker&#160;:( need to fix
 jacek: :upside_down:
 HoriMiyamura: still don't know how to face 2atts
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm starting to hate this game
 HoriMiyamura: rank 80, resubmit and nerver go higher than 200&#160;:(
 Murat_Eroglu: Same
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so many bots my win&#160;% is close to 50%, you have to be definitively better to go up
 FaRNaM.Hs: Bye world
 jacek: Oo
 HoriMiyamura: 2atts every where&#160;:(
 ataya-codam: can you play red when testing your code?
 5DN1L: yes
 jacek: yes
 HoriMiyamura: yes
 ataya-codam: how?
 jacek: oh my
 jacek: under ide, delete your bot
 ataya-codam: ok, did it. now what?
 5DN1L: add the boss and yourself back in reverse order
 ataya-codam: oh i see
 ataya-codam: ty
 bourgeof: HoriMiyamura See bowwowforeach.He is top 1 and seems to have only 1 attacker.
 HoriMiyamura: thanks, let me check
 bourgeof: There is till hope for people like us :smiley:
 Miki09: What if I am submitting my code and the contest ends?
 therealbeef: it waits for you to finish
 Miki09: ok thx
 HoriMiyamura: when contest end, it will get all the current submits, and then recompute
 HoriMiyamura: *for legend it will recompute
 HoriMiyamura: for other it will wait for all of them complete
 therealbeef: you can even promote on the last submit and then the system will wait for you to finish all matches in the higher league as well
 HoriMiyamura: can't under stand bowwowforeach strategy at all&#160;:(
 LaurensD: @HoriMiyamura a lot of foreach, no one can understand
 MindController: It seems he tracks the enemy attacker
 MindController: And tries to counter it
 _NikJ: Looks like no legend for me :D
 _NikJ: 100th in gold rn&#160;:(
 yhyoxx: got to 6th in gold 
 yhyoxx: same code is 300th now ...
 Miki09: Me too _Nikj
 Miki09: I was 800 but im 1593 now
 Miki09: But I still hope...
 yhyoxx: sad
 Miki09: Off Hope is the last to die!
 yhyoxx: is it :cry:
 HoriMiyamura: which is your case when use control and shield for defending?
 HoriMiyamura: I can't think of a good case for these
 PatrickMcGinnisII: dbdr gonna jump into legend?
 yhyoxx: duh
 dbdr: PatrickMcGinnisII, possibly with a bot I submitted two days ago :D
 _NikJ: that moment when you play the code against your old bot, go make a coffee and come back to a 3:0 loss
 _NikJ: but you realize you swapped the positions, so it's actually a 3:0 win :sunglasses:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my defense sucks
 HoriMiyamura: just a few hours
 HoriMiyamura: resubmit same code make my rank go from 80 to 18x
 HoriMiyamura: I can't believe in my eyes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i will be lucky to stay in top 1k
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there r some improvements
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but i spent too much time fixing bugs
 StevenV: which is a good ways to counter 3 defenders?
 _NikJ: to hope to God you don't run into them
 mdeetea: @StevenV have you try to use 2 attackers?
 HoriMiyamura: lengend will be recompute at the end of the contest isn't it?
 AlkhilJohn.: hello
 [CG]Keelhaul: Yes
 HoriMiyamura: haha, so I don't need to regret for resubmit :D
 LaurensD: well, you might end up 300th and become in the top 100 after a while (based on the battles after). 
 LaurensD: or vice versa
 LaurensD: random numbers, btw =P
 HoriMiyamura: :D
 HoriMiyamura: the more I submit, the lower my rank
 HoriMiyamura: even they just the same'
 _NikJ: it happens, I resubmitted the same code by accident
 _NikJ: and went from 100th ingold to 250th
 Murat_Eroglu: :D I stopped submitting  because of that reason
 Altaire: ‚ÄúMy dear, here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that.‚Äù
 Noyotens: how to beat a mana collecter
 Noyotens: they dont attack
 Noyotens: they just defense and collect mana
 HoriMiyamura: haha
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/630307805">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/630307805</a>
 iwillgetbetter: Just to be sure, a turn follows these steps: heroes move, wind spells, monsters move, heroes fights monsters in range, other spells&#160;?
 Noyotens: yes
 iwillgetbetter: then there's a problem, I have a spider with 1 of life, distance is 400 to base, I should fight her, but my base still loses a health point
 DaNinja: control, shield, heros move, combat, wind, then move mobs
 iwillgetbetter: thank you
 cegprakash: my gold bot climbed to rank 43 in legend over night when I went to sleep don't know if I can trust this rank..
 cegprakash: lool
 yamo: cegprakash submit again, so you will know&#160;:)
 cegprakash: nah want to enjoy my rank for a while
 cegprakash: lol
 StevenV: haha
 DollarAkshay: if ai apply control spell every alternate turn, the enemy hero still cannot use shield right&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: I* apply
 StevenV: I think the reason is that top player resubmit
 cegprakash: DollarAkshay can..
 StevenV: and then we face them while we submit too
 StevenV: at the time we will be penalty a lot
 cegprakash: say opponent uses ctrl on turn Xyou can either use shield on turn X or turn X+2
 cegprakash: only turn X+1 actions are replaced
 cegprakash: but if he is using chain control then u can't defend
 cegprakash: alternate is defendable
 cegprakash: I have not seen the referee but based on my observation I'm saying
 DollarAkshay: Hmm so there is no way of chasing and controlling right&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: Like chasing behind the control hero
 DollarAkshay: controled*
 cegprakash: just try to use shield on ur defender hero when u are in threat and ur hero is not being controlled.. no need to complicate
 cegprakash: I don't usually use shield on my defenders tho
 cegprakash: shield is bad if opponent is a wind player
 cegprakash: he can push us into defense which sometimes is good
 cegprakash: gold boss is a wind player so I don't shied my defenders in gold at least
 cegprakash: but yeah if u are using only 1 defender it's better to shield him
 cegprakash: that's what I've seen in top tier legends with 1 defender
 Ekaon: Is there a way to know if we are a debug game or in tournament game&#160;?
 Rikerslash: Did my Hero just bug out in turn 176. It says move MOVE 4480 2650 but he walks different direction<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/630342865">https://www.codingame.com/replay/630342865</a>
 Rikerslash: right instead of left. What am I missing?
 Valdemar: He is pushed by wind from hero 0 on that turn Rikerslash
 IvesL: you are pushed away
 LaurensD: you are being pushed away
 LaurensD: that hero is a bully
 Rikerslash: yea thanks was sure I missed something
 LaurensD: man, the ide of c# iis rather slow 
 Ekaon: Is it normal to not see the error stream in the tournament battles&#160;?
 pandaburger: I have a question about JS arrays, is it not possible to have "return someVariable;" in the array function of an array's forEach(()=&gt;{}).....
 pandaburger: I just answered my own questions
 pandaburger: -s*
 pandaburger: hahah I mixed up the arrow function's foreach with the parent function's
 pandaburger: so when I wrote return in there I was only returning to the parent function and the parent function didn't do anything, so ... undefinied
 MindController: Will legend be resumbitted at the end of the contest?
 kovi: no resubmit just a huge number of games
 avdg: LaurensD how much time do you use per round?
 kovi: for top100
 avdg: I'm already off to a side project
 MindController: kovi does the score i have now chages anything, or can i resumbit?
 MindController: changes*
 MindController: like
 MindController: do i lose anything
 kovi: you can resubmit even last minutebut depending on rockpaperscissors effect it may result slightly different result may
 MindController: if i resubmit now and i get a unlucky submit?
 avdg: I'm prototyping programming languages a bit, experimenting with representations that can be converted to something a cpu/gpu can understand
 MindController: at the end oif the contest we will just get extra games?
 kovi: yes, thousands
 MindController: score for previous submit will stay + extra games
 MindController: ok
 IvesL: is it really a rockpaperscissors cuz rank1 have few variants in defense
 eulerscheZahl: thousands as in "almost exactly 1000"
 eulerscheZahl: each player gets 500 games. but you are also part of other players getting a game
 blasterpoard: IvesL there's not that much RPS; it's mostly people loking for excuses for not climbing
 IvesL: i agree
 DomiKo: people just hate this game
 DomiKo: I'm one one of them :smiling_imp:
 blasterpoard: skill cap is high enough to win the entire contest with many different strategies
 IvesL: blasterpoard i see you have changed quite a lot in strats comparing to few days back as well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 685th, i guess I'm going to sleep at 8am
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII yawns</b></p><p><img src="/a/36336680250371" /> blasterpoard: I want defenders to waste 1 turn and 20 mana on shields, then continue as before&#160;:)
 blasterpoard: with the difference that I can't accidentally push them into defense
 blasterpoard: + some tweaks to not get killed by 1 attacker before the timing push
 eulerscheZahl: hero move before WIND makes it hard to use wind properly
 mybk: Hi, the simulation of the game does not work with me anymore, anyone facing the same problem&#160;? or knows how to solve it&#160;?

 MindController: why do u try to push shielded monster at frame 80?
 eulerscheZahl: to push the attacker which moved away?
 blasterpoard: nah, just a good old bug
 eulerscheZahl: a good old shielded bug
 blasterpoard: missing an if somewhere
 DomiKo: Euler wow
 eulerscheZahl: [master 7b9798f] attacker logic
 eulerscheZahl: didn't even change that much
 DomiKo: now I have to find what did you changed
 wlesavo: oh nice euler, quality improvements or just lucky submit? :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: i changed some behavior but did not expect a big impact actually. maybe 5 ranks gain
 cegprakash: good old bug lol
 eulerscheZahl: should have done this 19h later, now you will try to analyze me&#160;:(
 DomiKo: ofc we are :D
 eulerscheZahl: or the submit will just drop like a stone, only 20%
 blasterpoard: idk, you said you changed offence and you're not killing me fast enough
 wlesavo: not me, my deep analysis left me deep at the legend bottom 
 blasterpoard: so not really interested in your bot

 eulerscheZahl: struct smurfing in top10 confirmed
 HoriMiyamura: :D
 DomiKo: struct 50 points incoming
 HoriMiyamura: 49.9 points is good enough
 struct: lol
 struct: 50 is impossible
 struct: you can only get 8.0 higher than rank 2 right?
 DomiKo: for you? :wink:
 struct: yes impossible :p
 eulerscheZahl: not sure about the exact limit. but 50 is impossible
 eulerscheZahl: indeed
 IvesL: i think 40 is good enough already
 IvesL: according to the distribution of trueskill
 struct: last contest diff was 6.85 between rank 1 and 2
 IvesL: &gt;99.7%
 eulerscheZahl: i expect you to do better than that struct
 IvesL: the true &gt;99% comparing to language certificates
 blasterpoard: this time, there might not be even a 1 point difference, simply because of fog of war
 struct: or may be even more

 blasterpoard: or karIiso
 blasterpoard: the usual suspects
 Zyk0: I wanted to see reCurse's bot
 cegprakash: bowbowforeach look like u have a GA 
 cegprakash: nice combos
 DomiKo: GA :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: there are more search algorithms than just GA
 cegprakash: but this is a simultaneous game
 struct: I think its smitsimax
 cegprakash: not alternate move game
 cegprakash: so GA
 DomiKo: is this a problem?
 DomiKo: for any algo?
 struct: But I havent even looked at his games
 cegprakash: smitsimax look like a GA
 struct: is mcts a ga?
 cegprakash: except there is no backpropogate in GA
 DomiKo: The GA can't handle the difficult behavior of the opponent
 Westicles: America's hopes rest with CaptainHamburger
 cegprakash: MCTS is not
 cegprakash: but MCTS is kinda too much random
 eulerscheZahl: sounds very american
 JRFerguson: you can take some ms to GA the opponent and then GA yourself
 cegprakash: GA has mutation
 JRFerguson: it works in some cases
 cegprakash: so u converge to accuracy in GA while MCTS is just random
 DomiKo: JRFerguson that dosent really help
 JRFerguson: it does to some extent
 cegprakash: MadKnight used to say GA everything
 JRFerguson: not the same as minimax or smitsimax of course

 Dapps: I've done too many simultaneous enhancements my rank has dropped
 Dapps: now to slowly undo them...
 eulerscheZahl: classic
 rockyyyyyyy123: How can i start coding? or learn
 cegprakash: w3schools.com rockyyyyyyy123 just learn the sytax like basic loops arrays, then u are good to start solving problems
 IvesL: you learn coding by start coding?
 cegprakash: syntax*
 Dapps: I wonder if bowwowforeach is using some sort of brute force search. i think he did the same in a kaggle competition i was in
 wlesavo: if this submit end up in top150 im not touching this mess ever again  :slight_smile:
 DomiKo: good decision
 IvesL: dont touch old code, you rewrite it
 cegprakash: bowwowforeach is using symmetry property at it's best from my observation -_-
 Dapps: think most top bots are. it's a lot of useful info if you see/don't see a spider
 PRO_G_r_AM_m_ER: how fast can a hero move  ?
 wlesavo: took me about 15 minutes to code today, including finding spawning positions in referee  
 PRO_G_r_AM_m_ER: i see 800
 ddreams: what are the spawning positions?
 ddreams: is it a fixed list or just the area?

 cegprakash: bowbowforeach's defender is following my attacker like vodafone's pet dog :P lol 
 IvesL: do you think purely following is a good strategy?
 IvesL: assigning one hero
 cegprakash: it works for bowwowforeach

 Dapps: shh don't tell him
 cegprakash: lol
 Dapps: anyone know the vector math for where to target when a spider is on the edge
 Dapps: i find i blow them everywhere but where i want it to go
 cegprakash: for attacking u mean Dapps?
 cegprakash: heropos+target-monster vel
 pandaburger: I just gotta say that using code games as a hiring test is retarded, and makes me use ableist terms. 
 Dapps: cegprakash yup attacking. so hero.pos + enemybase.pos - monster.speed?
 cegprakash:  yes try it Dapps
 Dapps: thx
 Valdemar: cegprakash no need to use monster.speed, they pushed before move and after that cannot move 
 cegprakash:  enemybase.pos - monster.speed gives the direction of wind
 cegprakash: doing hero position + direction of wind gives the target of wind
 cegprakash: Valdemar
 cegprakash: sorry.. Dapps 
 cegprakash: heropos+target-monster pos
 cegprakash: good catch Valdemar
 Dapps: you tricked me! no wonder i lost so many in a row
 cegprakash: typo

 Astrobytes: Yes
 Venneth: allright thank you
 Astrobytes: top left 0,0
 Venneth: allright got it
 MrPc: I want to practice data structure and algorithm
 VaseSimion: Then I would suggest doing some practice problems. That is your best start to get used to codinggame
 VaseSimion: Then you just go harder 
 MrPc: Thanks.
 IvesL: if you want practising data structure and algos, isnt leetcode better?
 VaseSimion: There is a big challenge ongoing, but it ends in 17 hours and you might not get much of it
 VaseSimion: Leetcode might be better, but this is more interactive and fun (from my own experience with both)
 Dapps: +1
 Dapps: although i wish they ran these competitions more often
 Dapps: and not escape room ones..
 VaseSimion: I have not tried the escape rooms, yet

 Astrobytes: if any mods are in chat, the spambot is back on discord
 5DN1L: done, thanks!
 Astrobytes: 5DN1L: thank you very much&#160;:)
 5DN1L: np&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i think the spambot is actually a hacked account. saw the same on topcoder discord and when the user was messaged, he said something along the lines
 eulerscheZahl: that also makes it close to impossible to prevent it with extra authentication steps
 Astrobytes: yeah, it uses hacked accounts as spambots
 Astrobytes: it's a nightmare to control it seems
 eulerscheZahl: so first you get hacked, then banned :D
 eulerscheZahl: great day
 Astrobytes: lol, right
 jrke: replay limit is now frustating me!
 jrke: time to setup it locally now
 eulerscheZahl: replay limit. you mean that it only shows the last 500 in your history?
 Astrobytes: I think he refers to the ide play limit
 jrke: yeah ide replay
 jrke: online ide

 jrke: not lot its everything grey
 struct: never faced that problem
 blasterpoard: eulerscheZahl just a lucky submit; not that much changed from the previous one
 struct: not that much can help
 AshKetchum: blasterpoard, looking at your profile pic, I can't stop thinking if you switched b and p in your nickname:grimacing:

 ZndrBrok: IS there a moderator in the place&#160;?
 ZndrBrok: C# language assist is always broke... It was the same trwo days ago and i see it's always the case&#160;:/
 ZndrBrok: i can write "hsdighf;" and it will only throw me the error when it compile...
 struct: Im just a chat moderator
 struct: Report it on forums I guess
 eulerscheZahl: lucky submit? i can totally identify with that
 eulerscheZahl: or with a lucky start at least
 struct: timer is blinking...
 eulerscheZahl: no, just red
 struct: you are right
 Astrobytes: "indeed"
 struct: :grin:
 BrunoFelthes: 700 bot computing... every contest is the same thing... servers cant handle the last day of the competition... it is depressing
 Astrobytes: at least we *have* a contest
 Dapps: buy them more servers
 BrunoFelthes: they should have a paid service to add more services and have a priority queue to the one that contribute... an aws server is $3 a week
 BrunoFelthes: i could pay $10 to have a priority queue
 Samer: fairness is crucial in this competiton
 Astrobytes: we had this discussion yesterday
 Astrobytes: I would agree with donations for server power but I wouldn't agree with pay to win, neither does CG
 Samer: I wasn't here yesterday, but if servers can be rented for the last few days of each competition, I'm happy to pay for them... just who do i talk to?
 BrunoFelthes: why it is not fair??? they should ask for 2 or 3 more server... than the ones that will pay, will add more server for everyone
 Astrobytes: a priority queue for those who paid is unfair
 Astrobytes: not everyone can afford to contribute
 Samer: there are a lot of students and people who can't afford to pay but want to play and have fun, why should they be at a disadvantage?
 Samer: anyway, who do I talk to regarding my proposal?
 IvesL: how about priority queue with cooldown, only prioritize same user every few hours?
 Astrobytes: it won't happen Samer
 Astrobytes: we have made suggestions like this for years
 Samer: why not Astrobytes? consider it a donation
 Samer: oh, wow ok
 Samer: that's messed up
 Samer: I for instance, couldn't work on my code for 2 days... and today I have time, but submitting takes hours and it's a bit discouraging 
 BrunoFelthes: it is not unfair, they will have their position later, only it... and priority, is not before, is that you have your processor.... you have garantee that you have your queue in 10 minutes
 ZndrBrok: Hi guys, can somebody try to write C# code and confirm that the language assistance is broken&#160;? I am not sure if this bug is more global or concern only me... Two days ago other people where writing about the same problem, but today i see nobody speeking about that :P
 ZndrBrok: It's so frustrating
 ZndrBrok:&#160;:/
 Samer: ZndrBrok I never used it, don't think I even saw it working, I code in VS and just paste here to submit
 Dapps: I have the same issue. I just don't rely on it and us VS Code
 ycsvenom: struct i know you good in c++ can you lead to how to start playing with OS?i am sorry if the question is a bit ambiguous but that's the best i can do
 ZndrBrok: Ok, thanks guys&#160;!
 Astrobytes: ZndrBrok: most of us code offline in an IDE of our choice, personally I use visual studio, or sometimes vscode for quick things
 LaurensD: Yeah use external tools, the ide is slow here unfortunately.
 Samer: I also dump all game input each turn, and use that data in VS to analyze any particular game turn, very useful
 Dapps: +1
 struct: ycsvenom I only use c++ here tbh
 heiyao: ‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πàÊâìÂá∫Êù•ÁöÑÂèòÊàê‰∏≠Êñá‰∫Ü
 ZndrBrok: @Samer, i need to read more about that&#160;!
 ZndrBrok: I didn't knew u can do that :P
 Astrobytes: just copy to a text file, then set stdin to that text file in VS

 ZndrBrok: Ok&#160;!
 ZndrBrok: Thank you&#160;!
 Astrobytes: very useful, np
 Samer: I just paste the input to VS console, and set a breakpoint at the beginning of my strategy code section
 Astrobytes: ^ that works too
 cegprakash: This is what I use in C++ for debugging in Visual Studio 2019
 Astrobytes: yep, yet another way to do it
 Michael_Howard: How do you tell if a spider you can't see anymore is dead or something else happened to it?
 cegprakash: u need spider sense 
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Dapps: walked into that one lol
 stolyaroleh: with great mana comes great responsibility
 Michael_Howard: Should have by now, I've been bitten by enough spiders.
 Astrobytes: lol
 cegprakash: the yellow and pink spiders don't scare much.. the red spiders are deadly
 Astrobytes: the bluish-black ones you find under rocks in the UK give a nasty bite
 Astrobytes: tube-web spiders
 Astrobytes: false widows give a bit of a nip too
 44AA44: start
 44AA44: oops wrong chat
 44AA44: sorry
 cegprakash: too slow submits
 cegprakash: this is so sad
 cegprakash: given the last day of contest
 Astrobytes: it's ok, you're not going to sleep so why worry, just submit later
 cegprakash: I submitted 2.5 hrs back and it's only at 39%
 cegprakash: look like I can only do 2 more testing
 cegprakash: after this completes
 eulerscheZahl: wow, that's extremely slow
 Astrobytes: yes, we're all in the same boat
 Dapps: i get too impatient and make another change and start a new submit&#160;:(
 _NikJ: 1h ago, 21% xd
 eulerscheZahl: it's Sunday in France
 Astrobytes: 1hr 44m ago and at 56%
 _NikJ: servers lazy too?
 eulerscheZahl: Labor Day even, public holiday
 Dapps: 6m ago at 8%&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol
 _NikJ: same here, eulerscheZahl
 _NikJ: add weekend on top of, 5 days off 
 eulerscheZahl: too bad that holiday and sunday fall on the same date
 Astrobytes: ceg is already pinging Thibaud on discord to complain
 _NikJ: in my company, when a public holiday falls on sunday, it's extended to monday too
 Dapps: running so slow i'm watching every single battle in 1x
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 _NikJ: and still got time to go grab a coffee :d
 Astrobytes: at least you won't miss anything I guess
 Dapps: scores seem so close. 1pt difference can be 100 ranks
 ashiknur: why testing is taking too long?
 struct: too many submits
 struct: and low number of servers
 struct: and this is ifs bot if this was search it would be even slower
 cegprakash: true that struct
 stolyaroleh: I wonder if referee is slow/unoptimized
 cegprakash: I believe my straight foward if else would run under 10 ms
 struct: yes it is
 stolyaroleh: ^ exactly
 struct: you just need to check the 8k turns line
 stolyaroleh: would be cool if we could run a testing environment locally
 stolyaroleh: donate CPU power to codingame in exchange for quick feedback loop
 stolyaroleh: then, just write a bot that mines bitcoin
 struct: you can test locally vs your own bots

 raxkin: Hey, not sure if it's allowed to give tips for the challange, but if it's possible, anyone can share a article or some concepsts that i can research for calculating the push angle?

 raxkin: Currentlly pushing to 0,0 but would like to calculate the optimal point to don't push it to the wall all the time
 peerdb: Is it weird that I'm performing better against the top 150 of Legend than against the lower 150?
 DomiKo: no
 jacek: :neutral_face:
 cclaude42: Hello! Anyone know where I can find the formula they use to rank companies / schools in the contest&#160;?
 Kelos: raxkin, you need to calculate direction from mob to your base and push in that direction. WindPosition = HeroPosition + BasePosition - MobPosition
 struct: I think its just average of top N players
 jzen: "We take the sum of points of the top 5 players in each company/school with at least 3 players"
 raxkin: Thanks Kelos, will try it
 jzen: From the faq on the contest page
 cclaude42: OhAnd what's the "points"&#160;? Is it CP&#160;?
 jzen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-spring-challenge-2020/152927">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-spring-challenge-2020/152927</a>
 cclaude42: Awesome, thank you!
 gaha: hey is there final leaderboard recomputation after the challenge ends?
 blasterpoard: gaha everyone in legend gets another ~500 games
 blasterpoard: 500x2, actually, because you get 500 games from your recalc and around 500 from other people's recalcs
 cclaude42: Anyone know the fitness score required to be promoted to Legend?
 Astrobytes: &gt; than the gold boss
 Scarfield: when your submit has finished, and your score is greater than gold boss you will rank up
 cclaude42: Cool&#160;! Where can I check the boss score?
 Astrobytes: Leaderboard button on the left
 cclaude42: Scarfield when you say "finished" does that mean I have to wait for the little circle to be full&#160;? Do all my battles&#160;?
 Scarfield: you are not typing on your screen today i see astro :p 
 Scarfield: yes cclaude42
 Astrobytes: hahaha :D
 Scarfield: you could be higher than the boss during the submit, but it only counts when the submit has finalized
 5DN1L: cclaude42 I'm just curious... how did you rank up before gold? :open_mouth:
 Astrobytes: lol
 5DN1L: wow and cclaude42 even took part in other contests and bot games before :thinking:
 jacek: oh my
 Astrobytes: maybe it's a team account
 5DN1L: maybe
 Astrobytes: or perhaps he has a truly terrible memory :D
 5DN1L: terrible indeed if that's the reason...
 5DN1L: both short-term and long-term memory
 Astrobytes: Indeed. A wonder he can function in daily life
 5DN1L: lol
 cclaude42: Oo found it&#160;! Thanks everyone
 jacek: :tada:
 cclaude42: To answer your question, it has been a while, but usually I just... rank up without paying attention LOL
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 cclaude42: Never been legend before so all pumped at the idea!
 derjack: oO
 Astrobytes: nice one, good luck&#160;:)
 cclaude42: VS matches taking forever tho :weary:
 struct: is not that bad
 Scarfield: its not that good either :p
 struct: But I do make sure I use all my 50ms
 struct: each turn
 struct: just in a while loop that checks the time
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Scarfield: xD
 JohnyDaison: How is it possible that I'm getting in inputs a mob that is outside my sight range and on top of that getting incorrect position of it? (different from what the popover box in game shows)
 AshKetchum: JohnyDaison, if you are saving them to an array, are you clearing the array before input?
 Scarfield: the game works, so maybe you have data from previous turns
 JohnyDaison: I have data from previous turns, but I want them. The problem is that the update I get from the game is incorrect.
 Astrobytes: are you matching the input to the correct IDs?
 Astrobytes: ie. updating the correct entities
 JohnyDaison: yup, there is no other mob close by for whom that position could be valid
 5DN1L: matching the replay with the wrong turn?
 JohnyDaison: I tried looking on turn forward and turn back, still doesn't make any sense.
 cclaude42: Well so far it's been about 90 minutes and I'm only at a third of the circle, looks like it'll been another couple hours before I know how I fair!
 AshKetchum: do previous turns match? the initial ones
 JohnyDaison: *one
 5DN1L: share a replay and give an example, JohnyDaison
 JohnyDaison: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/630653426">https://www.codingame.com/replay/630653426</a>
 5DN1L: give an example of the inputs of a turn you're seeing wrong
 5DN1L: and the turn number
 DustinNunyo: I wish I would have known how fun this spring challenge was sooner. I've only had the past 2 days to work on it. That being said I am number 22 in bronze league which I don't think is too bad for only working on it yesterday and this morning. lol
 JohnyDaison: So, the first time i see in inputs mob id 149 is on turn 183.
 cclaude42: Dw about it Dustin! We'll just say it's practice for the 2022 Fall Challenge :D
 JohnyDaison: I get position 3429, 7843. And now I see that's the position the game shows in turn 182. OK, but that's not the biggest issue.
 Astrobytes: JohnyDaison: that's correct
 Astrobytes: oh sorry, didn't read your second part
 AshKetchum: JohnyDaison, from turn 187 your hero walked that monster-149 and launched it at the end. Fun to watch :joy:
 5DN1L: The end of result of turn 182 is the inputs to the beginning of turn 183
 JohnyDaison: OK, I see what's the issue now. I have a lot of debug output and it causes the log scrolling to go out of sync with the game visualisation. Which is frankly quite annoying.
 DustinNunyo: Right? Going to try to figure some things out between now and then hopefully. Like how to separate my projects into different files. lol
 Astrobytes: You know about the multiplayer section on the site right DustinNunyo?
 DustinNunyo: I know about the vs section and I've seen a co-op section that I would like to check out.
 JohnyDaison: I'm looking at the log for turn 192 but the game is on turn 194.
 Astrobytes: cause all/most of the previous contests are available to play at any time, plus user created games
 DustinNunyo: Oh, yeah, I know about that, and I definitely plan on continuing this challenge. Just would have been nice to have had more time before the deadline. lol
 DustinNunyo: It's entirely my fault. I knew about this site. I just hadn't been keeping tabs on it and didn't realize how fun it had gotten.
 Astrobytes: ah cool, don't worry, just do your best if you have some time now, if not.. at least you did something!
 jacek: so is there is anything other than clashes?
 Astrobytes: jacek: :smirk:

 eulerscheZahl: those should be self-explanatory without being explicitly written down&#160;:(
 Link_jon: sadly, the fact you had should in your sentence is showing&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Link_jon: ... on a different note nil is being a pain
 eulerscheZahl: i also mean blast bugs in opponent base and do the opposite
 Link_jon: ooo kaboom
 Link_jon: wait can bugs explode? hm. i guess the more painful one cause ripples
 Astrobytes: thought you'd given up euler
 eulerscheZahl: i did
 eulerscheZahl: then i had this lucky submit which later dropped a lot:
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 Dapps: i think i saw that. saw your name top 3 i believe
 jacek: impossibru
 eulerscheZahl: this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/mdrEf6F">https://imgur.com/a/mdrEf6F</a>
 eulerscheZahl: was a pain to see it drop again
 Astrobytes: ouch
 Dapps: looks photoshopped
 Astrobytes: lol I hope you're joking
 eulerscheZahl: it's a real screenshot
 eulerscheZahl: finished 25th
 Dapps: yea was jk :P
 jacek: nyoro~n
 Astrobytes: 25th, quite a drop
 eulerscheZahl: and i don't have photoshop. long live gimp
 Astrobytes: +1 to that
 Astrobytes: krita is good too
 eulerscheZahl: i have it installed but never really tried it
 struct: This is what I do to stop looking at the rank
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/Nbgm9qT.png">https://i.imgur.com/Nbgm9qT.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: illedan does that too
 Astrobytes: krita is better for actually drawing, think gimp wins in manipulation
 eulerscheZahl: for gimp i had to find a tutorial on how to draw a circle
 jacek: paint plx
 Astrobytes: lol, gimp interface is ... slightly unintuitive
 eulerscheZahl: circular selection tool =&gt; select edge =&gt; increase width =&gt; fill with paint bucket
 eulerscheZahl: at least it's all in a single window now and not that many small windows floating around anymore
 eulerscheZahl: that's a pain to use with i3wm
 Astrobytes: I think you can still detach them
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to
 Astrobytes: if you like that kind of thing
 eulerscheZahl: delphi 7 IDE also was like this
 eulerscheZahl: was my first ever IDE (if you don't count a turbo pascal command line application as IDE)
 Astrobytes: mid-late 90s?
 eulerscheZahl: probably
 Astrobytes: I vaguely recall it
 Husoski: When I used it, Turbo Pascal didn't have a command line...
 eulerscheZahl: was already outdated when i used it around 2005 or so
 Dapps: VB6 all the way
 Dapps: so amazed when i first opened the ide
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://winworldpc.com/product/turbo-pascal/5x">https://winworldpc.com/product/turbo-pascal/5x</a>i think that's what i started with (won't download to check)
 eulerscheZahl: 5.5
 Husoski: ...and then disappointed that it was still BASIC?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I still have a copy of Visual C++ somewhere in a box
 Astrobytes: 5 or 6 iirc
 eulerscheZahl: should we call the historians on you?
 Husoski: I had some MS C 3.1 stuff on 5.25" floppies not that long ago.  
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: I've got a massive bag of Amiga 1200 floppies ( games, tools etc) and no floppy drive
 Astrobytes: no Amiga either but that's less of an issue
 Husoski: I'm afraid to even plug in my Atari 800...
 Astrobytes: you should!
 Husoski: No TV in my house will play NTSC video anyway.
 Astrobytes: (plug it in I mean, not be afraid :P )
 Astrobytes: ah
 Husoski: Not sure what happens when electrolytic caps dry up.
 Astrobytes: I think it just fails

 Astrobytes: Scarfield :rofl:
 Astrobytes: jacek: wow, never seen one of those. RISC-based?
 MrUnofficial: kostas
 jacek: it was some NES clone with keyboard
 Astrobytes: nice!
 Astrobytes: more importantly: did it work properly
 jacek: for the time being...
 Astrobytes: lol, that's all that matters

 jacek: hm?
 Astrobytes: got it now, opened it in another browser
 Astrobytes: was it any good tho
 Astrobytes: and wtf
 jacek: dunno i havent had one. im aware of many playstation nes clones
 Astrobytes: madness
 jacek: crazy 90s-00s
 cegprakash: does anyone feels ladder is broken due to too much active submits
 Dapps: thought it was great, was moving into top 100. i'm falling out of top 100 so i agree it's broken..
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 cegprakash: I was in top 40 at 50% dropped to 110
 Astrobytes: we await your pm where you state your highest position achieved during a submit as your 'true rank'
 Astrobytes: :D
 uEnvy: its updating very slowly compared to submissions other days so may be overloaded ya
 uEnvy: 30 minutes for 18% progress
 _NikJ: jeez, even regular plays are slow af
 jacek: regular?

 5DN1L: You wanna get kicked out too? ayaan-dev
 ayaan-dev: nah im fine
 5DN1L: good to know
 ayaan-dev: ye
 ayaan-dev: :apple:
 5DN1L: you just can't resist the temptation to get kicked
 cegprakash: the professionals here who take part once an year like me can gladly donate for 1 server cost for 10 days and probably many of us can sponsor for more servers.. why CG does this to us year after year
 Espiobest: SDN1L average discord mod
 LeJordy: lol
 5DN1L: SDN sounds like a Malaysian company
 Espiobest: 5DN1L whatever, S is better tho. consider changing it
 5DN1L: anyway please stick to coding topics please, or get kicked out
 Espiobest: okbro
 Espiobest: what langs do you know
 5DN1L: check out my profile
 Espiobest: nice
 skotz: i'd gladly help crowdfund extra server capacity during competitions... wonder how scalable their infra is
 5DN1L: Somebody has to write a business proposal showing the profitability of such an idea before CG will accept it, I guess
 Westicles: Isn't there infra just 4 old PCs?
 uEnvy: one caught fire it seems&#160;:(
 skotz: i've convinced 12 other people at wok to sign up, plus i'm trying to get approval to use their tech screening tools during interviews
 cegprakash: I don't think they have 4 pcs
 cegprakash: just 1 server
 skotz: surely there's a way to put a dollar amount to keeping thousands of professional devs happy
 cegprakash: 940 submissions * 150 games * 20 ms  * 220 turns is like 3 hours all submissions should end
 cegprakash: that's in 1 PC
 Astrobytes:  thousands of professional devs + me
 cegprakash: ok my bad.. 172 hours for 1 PC
 5DN1L: keeping the shareholders happy or the professional devs happy, that is the question
 5DN1L: (why not both?)
 skotz: true... guess the trick is to tie one to the other
 Astrobytes: literally or figuratively? :P
 struct: and lets not forget compilation time
 struct: They compile the code every match
 struct: I think
 struct: :D
 5DN1L: Astrobytes lol
 skotz: :grinning:
 cegprakash: we need 1000 machines to handle this scale
 cegprakash: 1000 servers
 struct: ok now I can sim the wind
 struct: A bit late :p
 BoBot: @struct why would they compile every match? :O wouldn't caching the executables make more sense? (depending on the lang of course)
 struct: no idea BoBot
 BoBot: hmm, I wonder what the (compilation:match compute) ratio is
 BoBot: for c++ f.e.
 blasterpoard: afaik compilation is capped at 10 seconds, and re-compilation happens only if your bot hasn't fought on that machine (yet/for some time)
 jacek: i think they compile only once 
 blasterpoard: I've ran into that limit before
 BoBot: seems to make more sense at least
 struct: Maybe I'm wrong
 cegprakash: guys I don't understand how the monster gets damaged in between wind action
 struct: because damage applies before wind
 struct: You move attack and then wind

 cegprakash: turn 77 I've 879.189 distance to monster and I'm using wind
 cegprakash: but monster dies
 blasterpoard: enemy hero killed it
 cegprakash: no they are pretty far
 blasterpoard: before wind
 struct: there is an animation showing it
 struct: 717.05648313086
 struct: distance
 cegprakash: ok hero 3 is not in my vision
 rockyyyyyyy123: what does it means cin &gt;&gt;
 cegprakash: ok so it's not a bug in my code
 cegprakash: just that I can't see him
 JohnyDaison: rockyyyyyyy123 did you choose C language without seening it ever before?
 JohnyDaison: *seeing
 rockyyyyyyy123: JohnyDaison what lenguage i do then?
 JohnyDaison: javascript is pretty easy
 crazyfrog: how to get into the next the LEAGUE level?
 DustinNunyo: Woot! Made it to silver league before the challenge ended!
 JohnyDaison: congrats!
 Astrobytes: nice one DustinNunyo, congrats!
 rockyyyyyyy123: JohnyDaison i understand more things on C than on JavaScript just as a first view
 JohnyDaison: sure, in that case, cin is input
 rockyyyyyyy123: Thanks
 JohnyDaison: are you familiar with data types?
 rockyyyyyyy123: I think i know what is it but not the name, sounds familiar
 rockyyyyyyy123: I started yesterday tho
 JohnyDaison: oh, in C everything has to be typed properly, I can be a bit tough if you're a beginner. Javascript just lets you do things and figure out the types by itself.
 JohnyDaison: *It
 JohnyDaison: also, have you checked out the Starter Kit?
 rockyyyyyyy123: Nop, where is it?
 5DN1L: Are you working on the contest or something else? rockyyyyyyy123
 rockyyyyyyy123: I started the Onboarding game
 5DN1L: Yes, and I think you finished it, right?
 rockyyyyyyy123: No, not yet
 jacek: is this about which value is greater?
 5DN1L: rockyyyyyyy123 Hmmm, but I think you had passed it already :thinking: You got 100% score on it
 5DN1L: If you followed the tutorial instructions you should have solved it
 rockyyyyyyy123: Becaused it appeared the solution on it and i copy it haha. But i wanna make it on my self
 rockyyyyyyy123: by*
 5DN1L: i see, that's good

 ntsd: Why my sheild get bad command
 DomiKo: SPELL SHIELD &lt;id&gt;
 ntsd: oh
 ntsd: my bad
 ntsd: thank you
 DomiKo: no problemo
 struct: no account and no shirt
 struct: rip
 DomiKo: [*]
 struct: I still didnt give up yet
 DomiKo: still 12 hours to go
 struct: one more all nighter...
 Counterbalance: only time for 2 more submits
 struct: I only need 1
 struct:&#160;:)
 kovi: last morning usually (but not always) works better than last night
 kovi: also...you can submit one more 1 min before finish
 Counterbalance: 4h 15m in, at 96%, rank 16 gold.. not sure if i should..
 struct: how much distance form boss?
 kovi: from gold to top...we have seen that before
 Counterbalance: 7 positions, 1.1 points
 struct: Hard to say tbh
 Counterbalance: my bot rose about 100 places (in global leaderboard) today so I could risk it I guess
 mframbou: Hi, does any of you know what will happen at the end&#160;? If we are being ranked does the ranking continue or will everyone just stay in the same position whether or not they are currently being ranked&#160;?
 blasterpoard: mframbou everyone gets an extra 1000 games (like a submit with 500 games, but you also get challenged ~500x)
 blasterpoard: if you're in legend, that is
 struct: only top 50 gets that I think
 mframbou: Thank&#160;! So I should try to submit my final code more than 4 hours before deadline since ranking takes a very long time
 blasterpoard: that would be understandable, seeing how many people are in legend
 blasterpoard: mframbou all the submits finish first, only then the recalc starts
 struct: recalc will be over by tuesday :D
 mframbou: Oh ok so I should be able to submit only a few minutes before deadline (though that would be risky), I guess results will be announced a day or two after&#160;?
 blasterpoard: you'll see it nappenning live on the leaderboard just like now; you just won't get into the IDE
 mframbou: :thumbsup: thanks&#160;!
 Waffle3z: my joke submission is rank 251 in gold now, I haven't changed it since it was in 548th
 IvesL: @blasterpoard how many lines have you got
 blasterpoard: IvesL 2205
 IvesL: are you optimistic in securing #1
 struct: DomiKo you are in tshirt range, gl
 blasterpoard: no, there will be a ton of hiding players submitting in the morning 
 DomiKo: struct for now
 cegprakash: what's the order of submissions of bots during recalc
 struct: all at the same time
 cegprakash: oh damn..
 struct: and its not a submission
 cegprakash: kind of like what's happening now
 cegprakash: 1000 parallel submissions lol
 cegprakash: with such slow servers I'm scared to touch a single line
 nalka0: Yeah changing something is pretty scary atm x)
 Astrobytes: no point in hanging around when it's like this lol, see ya all tomorrow
 nalka0: Watching replays is still instructive ^^
 Waffle3z: if you blow a monster into range of the opponent's base, will it change directions and move another 400 towards the base at the end of the turn?
 struct: no
 struct: winded mobs dont move that turn
 struct: but it will update the direction
 cegprakash: I don't know why I'm tweaking against blasterpoard knowing that I'm never going to face him during calc
 cegprakash: but it's fun to tweak against him
 cegprakash: but who knows I get lucky seeds during calc and I end up facing him
 LiangK: I'm new here, does everyone here, like know more than one language already?
 cegprakash: LiangK almost all professionals do.. students usually know 1 or 2
 cegprakash: tweaking against blasterpoard means tweaking against everyone with 2 attackers
 blasterpoard: definitely no
 uEnvy: the double push is pretty brutal
 blasterpoard: what you see from most people is a sped-up and a bit less consistent version of what I did in gold
 _NikJ: _NikJ failed a CONTROL: Hero 2 doesn't know where entity 4 is, even though it's in my fov?
 ddreams: not in range of hero 2?
 cegprakash: yeah I cd manage them 
 cegprakash: but u on other hand use control the moment u see me
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: and I'm doomed
 cegprakash: eEnvy how about tetra push
 cegprakash: uEnvy u don't know tetra push 8800 distance?
 cegprakash: I'm around rank 30 how many gets T shirt
 DomiKo: 20
 cegprakash:&#160;:(
 cegprakash: can someone in top 20 donate the T shift to me for sportsmanship
 cegprakash: T shirt*
 cegprakash: I never won a T shirt
 struct: cegprakash can you tell me again the coordinates for wind please?
 struct: Im not good at math :p
 struct: Im using angle atm and its working
 cegprakash: lol
 struct: but with your math it will work aswell I think
 cegprakash: hero pos + target - monster pos
 struct: ty
 tobk: Somehow this is not my contest... any last minute tips to at least get out of Silver?&#160;:-(
 struct: tobk 3 defenders or 2 defenders with 1 attacker that just goes into opponent base and winds spiders into their base
 cegprakash: my rank is at The Life the Universe and Everything
 cegprakash: if u know what I mean
 cegprakash: tobk share a replay with silver boss
 blasterpoard: tobk get 180ish mana, control mobs towards (7000, 2000) (or flipped), run there with all 3 heroes, quadruple wind them into opponent's base, welcome to low legend
 cegprakash: will help u
 tobk: I'm already doing that (or at least I think I do), but somehow opp gets loads more mana than me. Last submission was ~Silver 200, current (calculating) is at 1000...
 cegprakash: share a replay tobk
 cegprakash: against silver boss
 tobk: "quadrupel wind".... wait, wind stacks? i.e. casting 2 winds in same round will move twice as far?
 blasterpoard: yes
 cegprakash: yeah tobk
 ddreams: yep
 blasterpoard: use 1 wind on a mob behind you at max range, the 3xwind towards the base
 cegprakash: basically u can push monsters 8800 units i.e. from middle of the board to kill
 cegprakash: in just 2 turns
 cegprakash: WIND + WIND,WIND,WIND
 tobk: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/630867110">https://www.codingame.com/replay/630867110</a>
 tobk: Hm, guess I should have asked earlier... not sure I really want to do that tweak now. But for sure after the contest.
 cegprakash: don't use ctrl in early game towards opponent u are gifting them free mana
 uEnvy: yeah using a ton of mana on early control just for them to die right away
 cegprakash: only use CTRL when opponent defenders are not doing their duty
 tobk: Good point, that was also something I realized today. I'm basically using the same set of rules in each turn, no real "early game" or "late game" differentiation.
 cegprakash: the strat could actually work if u start using CTRL after the red spiders come
 cegprakash: i.e. the late game spiders
 cegprakash: health of spider increases by 1 every 4 turns
 cegprakash: so early game spiders are easy to defend
 cegprakash: late game spiders are not
 cegprakash: so no point giving early farm to opponent when it's easily defendable
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/966605784781836348/969991439977160714/apocalypse.PNG?width=885&amp;height=669">https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/966605784781836348/969991439977160714/apocalypse.PNG?width=885&amp;height=669</a> 
 cegprakash: u can cause a zombie apocalypse in late game
 cegprakash: if u just save ur mana
 tobk: Thanks for all the tips! I'll try tweaking my mana use a bit, but will save the big coordination-refactoring for after the contest. One more submit, and if that sucks by tomorrow I'll just revert to my silver-200 bot.&#160;:-/
 cegprakash: I reached gold just by using wind 
 cegprakash: don't give up tobk
 cegprakash: zombie apocalypse is a decent strat for silver
 tobk: Right now ~50% against Silver Boss... I'll give that another go, but no time for mayor refactoring, with clogged servers and already past midnight here. Thanks again, see you tomorrow!
 cegprakash: gn 
 cegprakash: I can't believe my eyes my bot is at rank 25 the same bot with 1 less if was in 150+
 cegprakash: not sure if I can trust this rank
 cegprakash: I'll shave my head if I win a T shirt
 DomiKo: SS saved
 cegprakash: :D
 _NikJ: why is my bot asymmetrical if I'm using X, Y for left side and MAP_WIDTH-X, MAP_WIDTH-Y for right side..
 cegprakash: it can happen if u push a monster from inside the base to outside
 cegprakash: using wind
 cegprakash: as monster can move in random direction
 cegprakash: _NikJ
 _NikJ: random s got me banging my head against the wall
 _NikJ: thanks for the clarification
 wlesavo: there is a known bug in referee, so the seed does not guarantee reproducability
 struct: They dont do collision detection for games that end on same turn with lifes right?
 struct: Like on csb
 struct: The player who crosses end checkpoint first in the same turn wins
 DomiKo: they dont
 DomiKo: wild mana! 
 struct:&#160;:'(
 struct: oh right
 struct: I dont even track that
 DomiKo: struct should I resubmit? or not?
 struct: Same bot?
 struct: Check win rate vs top 10 if its higher than 60% I would
 struct: But if not I would not risk it
 struct: I finally managed to add wind to wind

 DomiKo: hmmmm nice idea
 DomiKo: checking against top10 is great idea

 struct: its worth the risk

 blasterpoard: shh
 cegprakash: or it's a bug
 cegprakash: I donno
 wlesavo: damn clever thinking
 wlesavo: that should be a nice pm, cant wait
 struct: you submited too soon blasterpoard
 struct:&#160;:)
 Waffle3z: can only wind 8800 away in 2 turns if it's in the same direction from where the monster is, if it comes in from the side then if you try to wind it at the base it will be out of wind range on the next turn
 cegprakash: not really Waffle3z
 cegprakash: u can adjust ur wind so monster stays in vision
 Waffle3z: yeah but now it's not going as far
 cegprakash: how much distance do u get
 cegprakash: only 6600?
 Waffle3z: does the monster still move another 400 at the end of the turn after wind?
 Waffle3z: "MOVE all monsters according to their current speed, unless they were pushed by a wind on this turn." does that mean if they were pushed by wind they won't move, or does it mean their movement won't be according to their current speed
 DomiKo: no
 cegprakash: Waffle3z check DM
 ClockSort: waffle3z no, the monster doesn't take a normal move if it was pushed by wind on the same turn
 IvesL: how come im timed out
 struct: This is the closest I've written to production code in years
 Darleanow: hey every1&#160;:)

 Darleanow: waddup&#160;?:)
 gabecarter3: lets go fellas new programmer here
 struct: not much, just doing the contest
 DomiKo: just rethinking some life decision
 Badoobicus: doing the "mad pod racing" challenge right now. does it usually take several hours to test your bot in the arena? while i was working on the Spring 2022 challenge last weekend, it was only taking like 10 minutes to run my bot through the arena
 DomiKo: to submit or not to submit
 MrAnderson: @Badoobicus it's the last day of a contest, all the servers are bogged down at the moment.
 Badoobicus: @MrAnderson oh yeah that sounds reasonable, I should probably wait and try this out again next weekend
 DustinNunyo: @Badoobicus Hey man, I'm doing the mad pod racing along with you. Nice bot! I'm very impressed by the fact that it's almost beat me a few times and it doesn't seem to ever use it's boost. lol
 MrAnderson: Try practicing against another bot for a while... you can make progress, at least
 MrAnderson: It won't update the leaderboard but you can work on improvements while you wait
 DustinNunyo: @Badoobicus I actually used your bot to test mine against before my last few submissions. lol
 Badoobicus: @DustinNunyo lol i havent programmed it to use the boost (yet). if i cant break out of wood with my current code though then i may need to add that
 Badoobicus: people must be going crazy for the 2022 spring challenge though, my pod racing code has been running in the arena for like an hour and a half and its only 80% done
 MrAnderson: There's 7000 players frantically submitting their code at once  :)
 DustinNunyo: @Badoobicus oh you are absolutely going to break wood man. We are going to bronze together! lol
 HoriMiyamura: :D
 Smelty: ;D i got to bronze and then let the code do its thing 
 Badoobicus: @DustinNunyo the arena keeps pitting my bot against yours but after like 20 battles the outcome is still the same
 HoriMiyamura: idk how to be in top 20 though
 Meteor_Shower: What rank do you have to rank from silver to gold?
 casmith789: above the boss
 HoriMiyamura:&#160;?
 HoriMiyamura: legend boss is top 1

 cegprakash: I have a huuuge bug
 cegprakash:&#160;:(
 cegprakash: and don't have much time left
 Counterbalance: it's not blinking yet

 cegprakash: so it's kind of crucial
 PatrickMcGinnisII: last submit... see if i stay in top 300gold
 dotnet007: anyone in c#?
 cegprakash: this is ur first of ur last submits u mean PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah, i got stuff to do.&#160;;)
 Link_jon: i probably could use C# but i prefer lua
 dotnet007: well what was the point of responding?
 Link_jon: i dunno. i guess because i *could* use C#
 Link_jon: ...huh yeah i  agree... how strange is me.
 dotnet007: backslash backlash could

 Link_jon: ohokay
 GuillaumeHendriks: This website has nothing to do with knowing how to code, sadge.
 Zyk0: What do you mean
 GuillaumeHendriks: It more or less evaluates how much you know the code and how to use it, but in a real life environment, i.e an office, with an IDE, you do not need to know if an object is nullable, the IDE will tell you. The bigger thing to know is how to properly code, clean code, SOLID principles, etc.
 Smelty: hmm
 jzen: I would certainly make a distinction between "knowing how to code" and being able to write a program that adheres to the SOLID principles
 stolyaroleh: intercontinental ballistic spider meta makes me sad
 Meteor_Shower: How do I know where the boss is?
 Wontonimo: wdym?
 ClockSort: think they'll add more servers? I'm 45% after two hours, well ahead of boss, waiting to get out of my league
 DaNinja: it takes 4 hours
 yhyoxx: so we have time for 3 submits and contest is over haha 
 BrunoFelthes: 900 submits running now
 BrunoFelthes: how many processors they have?
 BrunoFelthes: it is sad to see this pour service and cant contribute to it... all contest the same issue, and nothing to address it...
 Wontonimo: 8
 Wontonimo: jk, i have no idea
 Wontonimo: but I have to say, free is great.
 cegprakash: in legend the initial submit can be super random.. same code 7/10 win and 2/10 win
 cegprakash: making it difficult to know our change is good or bad
 cegprakash: without spam submit
 BrunoFelthes: and it will define your final position cegprakash, because it is very important at the final ranking
 Wontonimo: use brutaltester 
 cegprakash: yeah sad thing
 cegprakash:&#160;:(
 cegprakash: I think this will be my last test
 cegprakash: I lost patience waiting for submissions

 Butanium: why doesn't the wind work&#160;?
 mframbou: Thanks&#160;!
 Butanium: on the enemy hero&#160;?
 Wontonimo: wdym ycsvenom&#160;?

 ycsvenom: like changing the behavior of program of windows for example wontonimo
 Wontonimo: what?  really Butanium&#160;?  oh, that sucks
 Wontonimo: I don't have any experience with that ycsvenom 
 Butanium: yes Wontonimo I just checked the statement
 Butanium: I hate how this game viewer is conter intuitive
 cegprakash: the animation and debug mode helps tho Butanium
 cegprakash: even I got confused initially
 actualCoderTrevor: When you see the message about not reading all available input, is there a way to find out the first turn that you went out of sync on?
 Icebxrg: Hey all, I'm a freshman in college, took a course in java and one in C++. Dont really have a preference for either, which would be better for me to learn through this website? Want to get into competitive programming at some point soon
 Wontonimo: either
 Link_jon: (Strange thought, why not both?)
 Wontonimo: if you want to go deep into simulation and get to the top ranks in some of the technical multis, then C++ is the way to go
 stolyaroleh: why not Rust?
 ycsvenom: the evaluation process on the contest is really damn slow than before
 Meteor_Shower: I was on the boss. When will I rank up&#160;?
 Link_jon: Just dont forget to practice the languages you know, otherwise you'll turn to rust with em.
 Icebxrg: Ok thanks, appreciate the advice both of you. 
 Link_jon: Also, the competition stuffs has been running rather slowly so... who knows Meteor. Keep an eye on it :P
 Meteor_Shower: sad
 arrcpp: Is it possible to use Tensorflow in this game?
 Link_jon: I dont think so (its not in the language list)
 arrcpp: It is a library
 arrcpp: If it was available you could use from different languages
 struct: Some people implemented their own NNs frameworks here
 struct: I dont think its easy though 
 cegprakash: time to order breakfast after a sleepless night

 dot.nick: nice
 actualCoderTrevor: Thanks&#160;:)
 Smelty: rank 59....still waiting for sub to finish&#160;:( 
 cegprakash: is it a fair way to check win rate against our own bot against our own older bot to decide which one is better
 Smelty: its fair
 Smelty: although it is probably better to use a benchmark like the boss because your new bot might just happen to counter your old bot
 cegprakash: how many games are good enough for fair benchmark
 Link_jon: 25 should do i bet
 Smelty: id say 3 but the more the better
 Smelty: if you want to save time do less
 Link_jon: albiet idk how long said games take. ^^
 cegprakash: and what to do if a buggy bot has higher win rate
 Smelty: also i'd recommend only submitting if your new bot is way better than the old one
 Smelty: i'd test against other bots and if it works then sub while trying to figure out the bug
 Link_jon: Yeya, smack bug. Alternitevly, look into making bug a feature if it is being particularly helpful
 Smelty: yep
 cegprakash: u mean like blasterpoard who throws wind on a shield and still win
 Smelty: .....sure
 Smelty: try to fix it but sure
 cegprakash: it's 13-12 in favor of new fixed bot
 Smelty: lol
 cegprakash: against old bot
 Smelty: interesting
 Smelty: you can use standard deviation to figure out what margin of difference in terms of wins is good enough
 Smelty: but i'd say a 16-9 is good
 Smelty: im testing my new bot rn and its undefeated against old one :upside_down:
 Smelty: 16 wins in 16 matches so i submit
 struct: This game has more math than I even know existed
 struct: too bad I dont know any
 Smelty: xd
 cegprakash: did u do fantastic bits struct
 struct: I did sim
 struct: But never bothered to code an AI for it

 struct: But it knows the physics
 Smelty: i have like 3 header ifs and 3 ifs inside
 Smelty: each
 cegprakash: I just did ctrl + F "if (" and I've 185 if conditions on my code
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: lemme try
 Smelty: i have 17
 Link_jon: for some reason this reminds me of when i made switch() for Lua
 Smelty: ohno
 cegprakash: u need more ifs Smelty
 Smelty: ok
 cegprakash: more if means better ranking
 Link_jon: Your running low on power. Need to smelt faster.

 Smelty: ....repeat 
 cegprakash: haha struct fantastic bits needed more math than this to be honest
 cegprakash: with collisions and filipendo
 struct: flipendo is easy
 struct: is just apply force towards direction
 cegprakash: not really struct
 Smelty: lol
 cegprakash: that's why u didn't reach gold/legend
 Smelty: *calculus*
 cegprakash: u can hit it on the wall
 cegprakash: and it will rebound
 struct: im legend there
 cegprakash: oh 
 cegprakash: I'm just gold
 cegprakash: :D
 Smelty: LOl
 cegprakash: but I had filipendo on wall thing
 DomiKo: struct legend?
 DomiKo: top10 incoming?
 Smelty: ok my code was ranked 200 after like 20 battles
 struct: i dont know
 struct: I dont look at submit
 Smelty: so i resubmitted same code
 Smelty: and its 140 after 10 battles
 cegprakash: what happen to eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: he was #3 yesterday and he's 90 now
 struct: rng cegprakash
 cegprakash: is he hiding
 Smelty: idk
 Smelty: rng
 struct: He was my only chance to get a shirt
 cegprakash: rng?
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: random number generators
 Smelty: the spawn of the monsters can easily determine the victor in these top matches
 cegprakash: top players know how to handle different spawns
 struct: DomiKo I just copied some strategy I saw
 struct: but mine doesnt even work that well 
 struct: x
 Smelty: also im not even using shield rn
 cegprakash: plebs like me don't even care when they spawn
 Smelty: xd
 DomiKo: Many of us did that&#160;;)
 Smelty: one of mine just goes off on an adventure slaughtering the enemies they see
 DomiKo: If it work. It work
 cegprakash: if u see blaster he knows when and where he should be
 Smelty: if it doesnt try another
 cegprakash: and when and where monster will spawn
 Smelty: oh yea i clicked on his profile to see past matches and in the first one he leaked 3 monsters
 Smelty: so apparently wild mana is more important than lives
 struct: I just hope I get legend on this bumit
 struct: submit*
 struct: So I dont ever need to look at this game again
 cegprakash: lol struct
 Smelty: have fun with that
 cegprakash: many bots like u are stuck at 500ish right now good luck beating them and climbing the ladder struct
 struct: There is no luck here
 struct: Just wait until hiders submit
 struct: they will proove that
 cegprakash: u mean illedan and eulerscheZahl struct
 cegprakash: is there anyone who is using similar strategy like blaster in top 30
 cegprakash: I want blasterpoard to win 
 cegprakash: he chose his unique way which others hate and sticked to it :D 
 Smelty: ye
 cegprakash: so how many if statements do u have struct
 cegprakash: lets talk about if statements
 struct: no idea
 Noyotens: how to calculate distance needed to kill a spider before he reaches a point
 cegprakash: loop all the spider positions every turn
 cegprakash: see if u can reach spider position in the same no. of turns
 cegprakash: choose the point with lowest turns
 Link_jon: Thats a bit... difficult on the cpu, no?
 cegprakash: nope Link_jon
 cegprakash: I loop 100 turns for 2 monsters
 cegprakash: 2 monsters that are close to the base
 cegprakash: I don't care about other monsters
 Link_jon: Well. i was just thinking it would be more mobs around. like 30 for some reason.
 cegprakash: don't care about other monsters
 cegprakash: danger levels
 cegprakash: in 100 turns any monsters gets outside the board coz 100x300 is 30000
 cegprakash: and it's greater than diameter of the board
 cegprakash: so it's pretty easy to find if we can reach that monster 
 cegprakash: and the shortest path to the monster
 Link_jon: snoice
 struct: Im about to lose my mind
 DomiKo: me too, me too
 Link_jon:&#160;?
 44AA44: Is it possible to pass on a suggestion to the devs?
 44AA44: It would be nice if I could change the time limit of a private clash
 Smelty: reee in 6th
 cegprakash: An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 HoriMiyamura: Do you guys know an algorithm to find the point to attack monster?
 cegprakash: a for loop into future positions HoriMiyamura
 cegprakash: monster goes in straight line
 cegprakash: hero goes where u want to move
 HoriMiyamura: we can predict monster
 HoriMiyamura: I still don't figure how
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6dd1ecc2-9538-4304-b5b2-9c02f48d9b5d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6dd1ecc2-9538-4304-b5b2-9c02f48d9b5d</a>
 cegprakash: this is what I use HoriMiyamura
 HoriMiyamura: I mean I want to find a destination that can farm most monsters
 cegprakash: I don't have that
 cegprakash: this is only for intercepting a monster
 HoriMiyamura: with constraint that I would cover the shortest monster as well
 HoriMiyamura: ok, thanks
 HoriMiyamura: let me think
 struct: YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
 Link_jon: yee?
 struct: Im done
 HoriMiyamura:&#160;?
 struct: its over
 struct: the pain
 HoriMiyamura: Lengend?
 struct: I reached legend
 Link_jon: mucho congrats!
 struct: on last match
 struct: I fought the boss
 HoriMiyamura: oh
 struct: and won
 struct: ahahahah
 struct: it was needed
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: pro struct
 cegprakash: gold to direct win struct
 cegprakash: go for it
 HoriMiyamura: Tshirt is going for struct :D
 actualCoderTrevor: Nice job struct
 struct: thanks
 struct: I already have my postmortem ready
 Wontonimo: congrats struct&#160;!
 SashaNukem: congrats! 
 struct: "This contest made me never want to write an if statement again."
 struct: Thanks every1
 cegprakash: how many if u have struct
 Smelty: lol
 struct: too many
 cegprakash: that's not a number
 cegprakash: but i told u
 cegprakash: more ifs means better rank
 Wontonimo: I really wanted to make an NN for this contest, but no time
 actualCoderTrevor: I made most of one but had to abandon it for the same reason.
 struct: if on the entire code?
 struct: 79
 JohnyDaison: dude, me 78, I'm missing one somewhere then...
 Smelty:&#160;:(( ranked 2nd but its below boss
 HoriMiyamura: struct , do you know a ways to a destination that can farm most monsters, with constraint that it will cover a specific monster?
 struct: I dont do any of that tbh
 struct: I just look for closest threat early and closest mobs
 struct: and then I move 2 units too attack
 struct: I always attack 2 units at a time if its possible
 HoriMiyamura: ...
 HoriMiyamura: I do that too, but I think we can improve on this
 HoriMiyamura: this will make the farm most effective
 BFB123: penis are gay
 struct: BFB123 chill 
 SuperAstrid: OupsAn error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".  
 SuperAstrid:&#160;????
 Smelty: i forgor to prioritize closer enemies :skull:
 BFB123: Smelty you silly goose
 Smelty:&#160;:( im ranked 2nd in my league
 Smelty: below boss
 BFB123: Wut is a leage lmao I only do clash of code
 Smelty: lol
 cegprakash: bowwowforeach <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/631076164">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/631076164</a> timed out
 actualCoderTrevor: My heroes have a bad habit of attacking enemies in the opponent's base
 BFB123: thats kinda gay ngl
 Smelty: kalm down
 BFB123: Ok
 BFB123: Sorry
 BFB123: I ahd too much beerrs
 cegprakash: I lose 9-1 to highjump
 Smelty: F
 struct: come back when you are sober bfb
 SuperAstrid: OupsAn error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 SuperAstrid: What do I do now?
 SuperAstrid: Please help
 44AA44: Go outside? Take a walk? Idk
 cegprakash: take a coffee break SuperAstrid
 actualCoderTrevor: You can fire up brutaltester if you're desperate. Otherwise you just have to wait.
 Smelty: lol
 SashaNukem: how long do you have to wait?
 struct: it gets worse every time it shows up
 struct: so first time is not bad
 struct: but after it gets worse
 Smelty: lo
 struct: and worse
 SashaNukem: the horror 
 SashaNukem: :D
 Wontonimo: yeah, I got to Gold 
 SashaNukem: congrats!&#160;:)
 Smelty: nice!
 JohnyDaison: congrats!
 Smelty: im stuck at 2 places behind boss
 Dapps: wow I just watched Nanaeda's bot. very impressive
 HoriMiyamura: I don't know how to continue improve my bot
 Wontonimo: and another if
 SuperAstrid: oh no
 HoriMiyamura: another if make it dummier
 Dapps: take out an else
 actualCoderTrevor: Nice Wontonimo
 SuperAstrid: its happening again
 cegprakash: omg Nanaeda
 cegprakash: some sick defence + late game play
 Smelty: ikr
 struct: domiko resubmiting from rank 19?
 struct: o.o
 cegprakash: Nanaeda defense strategy: You shall not pass!!!!
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: *10s later* ok you can pass
 Dapps: cegprakash yeah it's really crazy to watch
 Dapps: even all the debug info... he has more states than i have LOC
 cegprakash: how he gets mana using so much wind is still a miracle to me
 cegprakash: he has one farmer for 100 turns I think
 cegprakash: 1 farmer and 2 defenders
 cegprakash: farmer becomes attacker in late game
 HoriMiyamura: he farm quite effective
 Smelty: lol
 Dapps: yeah calculating the best path where they intersect
 Smelty: ye
 Waffle3z: is resubmitting bad? the last couple times I've submitted I ended up in one place and then like 12 hours later went up 300 places
 Wontonimo: i think it depends on the league
 cegprakash: just when about to lost hope and ditch my version I get 10 back to back wins
 Wontonimo: in silver so many people made their bot overfit the boss, so if you got close to the boss
 cegprakash: seriously?
 Wontonimo: then those people overfitting will probably lose to you and push you up
 Smelty: nooo im first but below boss
 Wontonimo: you'll get pushed ... just wait a little
 Wontonimo: don'e resubmit
 Wontonimo: happened to me
 Wontonimo: give it 10 min Smelty
 Smelty: oki
 Smelty: oh im second now
 Smelty: im 0.05 away rip
 struct: onl√ßy 258 computing
 struct: damn
 Smelty: hmm
 Wontonimo: does't look like anyone else is around you to push you&#160;;(
 Smelty: :sob:
 struct: tbh I was a bit lucky to pass gold
 Lysk: it feels like JameX2 is pushing the boss down but not players, such a kind behavio
 Lysk: JamesX2 you're there?
 actualCoderTrevor: Is it possible to reach legend after the contest is over?
 actualCoderTrevor: Not that I think I would, I'm just curious
 struct: yes
 struct: I think so
 struct: Usually it becomes a multiplayer
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh cool maybe in a few months I'll have a shot
 cegprakash: I don't trust the leaderboard it can easily change +/- 50 
 struct: ofc
 Waffle3z: submitting at 197, let's see how far I drop
 struct: It depends on the players you battle
 struct: you might have good win rate vs some but bad vs other
 HoriMiyamura: it also depend on random factor
 HoriMiyamura: of the game
 Waffle3z: when we had 2000 computing bots in silver, when one battle was computed, was it counted toward both players' progress? or just one of them, and the other player would have to repeat the battle for it to count towards their progress
 Wontonimo: both players are adjusted
 Waffle3z: yeah but does it count towards the battle progress of both players
 Wontonimo: but it only counts towards the total battles of 1 player
 Waffle3z: yeah that's dumb
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Waffle3z: could have had almost half as many battles and finished in 6 hours instead of 12
 MAWAAW: I lose 42.75% of battles in gold league
 Smelty: f
 Tuo: quick survey, hero is killing a spider in base and there is a enemy hero. The defender should be:a) close to enemyb) far fromc) there are more important things
 Lysk: depends if attacker is at the right distance to wind it into the center and how fast you can kill it
 Wontonimo: d) taking care of the spider
 Tuo: hero can do many things at once&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: that's it for me.  Good night and good luck
 skagator: Damn I'm not sure I'm going to beat the Bronze boss
 cegprakash: skagator appreciate ur spirit
 david_lover: i can't find a solution to easy angle, from what i can tell you need to go WSW inorder to reach it but you can't do that. the next one is SW but that doesn't go far enough into the left. can anyone help me? 
 david_lover: btw i mean power of thor ep 1
 cegprakash: lol the same bot that was in rank 30-50 12 hrs back is not even at rank 100 now
 cegprakash: except for top 30 legend I don't think anyone has a solid win rate against anyone.. in 200 ranks range.. everyone are like 50-50
 david_lover: can anyone help me with my coding problem?
 Kellthazar: what is your problem?
 david_lover: its in the "power of thor - episode 1" activity. once you get to easy angle i find it impossible to get it to go in the right direction. the direction is WSW but you cant go that difrection you can only go SW as the code doesnt let you do that. me and my friend are really stuck. 
 ItsNotABug: Oof, got some close competition at the top
 Dapps: oh wow submit is so fast
 Dapps: 9min 29%
 cegprakash: may be admins woke up Dapps
 Dapps: or everyone else went to sleep :D
 cegprakash: 178 results found for ¬´Score - Computing¬ª
 cegprakash: 950+ became 178
 struct: I wonder if I should try a bit more
 struct: or just stop
 struct: I might be able to improve a bit in 4 ours
 struct: hours*
 DomiKo: I should paste the meme with miner
 struct: But I already found the diamonds
 struct: Should I dig for more
 struct:&#160;?
 DomiKo: even more diamonds?
 DomiKo: ehhh. There are already birds outside
 struct: I cant sleep anyways
 struct: I took too much caffeine 
 DomiKo: I took zero
 DomiKo: maybe that's the problem
 struct: top 20 should be safe
 DomiKo: idk
 struct: for you
 DomiKo: I played like 20 games with top15-20
 struct: I doubt you will lose 1.0 points in recalc
 DomiKo: if random will be on my side then no
 Nemisun: Im a network Engineer trying to learn how to code. This is no joke.
 Nemisun: Any advice?
 DomiKo: pick any yt tutorial
 DomiKo: that should be enough to start
 DomiKo: gn everybody
 Wontonimo: start with "The coding train" 
 Wontonimo: gn DomiKo
 struct: gn DomiKo
 Nemisun: Yea, I've been on a few but I chose to go with freecodecamp
 Nemisun: Basically learning Python on there
 Nemisun: Is the "coding train" on here?
 Wontonimo: it's a youtuber
 Wontonimo: javascript
 struct: Nemisun this site requires a bit of previous knowledge
 struct: but not much
 Wontonimo: whatever you decided to do, incorporate going back and redoing previous simple exercises and try to do them perfectly without looking at hints or googling anything
 Wontonimo: mastery of the basics and memorization of syntax is a must
 Smelty: :0
 ItsNotABug: Python ranking top makes me happy. Especially knowing how unhappy it makes cpp people :D 
 Smelty: lol
 ItsNotABug: Good job Djak. Looking forward to write up
 Nemisun: Ah, yea it seems so. I dont mind. Eventually I'll get acquainted. Atm Im planning on memorizing Syntaxes as well. I've found redoing the same thing over and over to be pretty helpful.  
 Miki09: Hi guys
 Smelty: nice!
 Smelty: hi
 Miki09: I got up 5:45 am to get to legend...
 Wontonimo: you got 4 hours left
 Miki09: I know
 ItsNotABug: And no chance of actually running your bot in arena before the end :D 
 Miki09: lol
 ItsNotABug: Just write perfect code and no problem
 Miki09: Yeah that sounds easy&#160;:-)
 skagator: lmao somehow I made it into silver
 skagator: mission accomplished for me XD
 Wontonimo: if you do it right, and don't **** it up, it works, it just works
 eulerscheZahl: struct in legend. congrats
 actualCoderTrevor: don't **** it up? Dang I knew I was doing something wrong
 struct: thanks euler
 Miki09: Imma try to copy boss 5 strategy
 Miki09: The attacker is effective
 actualCoderTrevor: The code I've updated in the past few hours is subjectively better but objectively worse.
 yhyoxx: yo, triple attackers
 yhyoxx: shame on you
 yhyoxx: kidding
 cegprakash: Dapps u are wrecking me
 struct: Ok it's time for my last push
 yhyoxx: congrats struct
 struct: thanks yhyoxx
 ClockSort: yeah, nice job struct.
 struct: thanks clock sort
 ClockSort: you overcame human nature to arrive in Legend :D
 struct: lol
 Miki09: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/631185773">https://www.codingame.com/replay/631185773</a> Boss has ERROR????
 Wontonimo: yup
 eulerscheZahl: bosses are just players too
 Wontonimo: it's just another player
 Miki09: oh ok
 struct: My bot has no errors
 cegprakash: said no one ever ^
 Miki09: My bot sucks but it has not got errors&#160;:-)
 struct: ok Im going to minimize chat, time to try a last thing
 struct: Will need to try math for it
 Wontonimo: :O
 cegprakash: do a ctrl+F after u play a game on IDE and search for "{username} failed"
 cegprakash: see how many shields u have wasted -_- thank me later
 JohnyDaison: If I submit shortly before the time runs out, will there be some time where we cannon submit but calculation continue to stabilize ranks?
 Wontonimo: yes
 JohnyDaison: ok
 Wontonimo: the cutoff is for submit.  Then all calculations continue
 struct: cegprakash I dont even need to do that
 struct: The answer is 0
 struct: I dont use shield
 eulerscheZahl: all pendings submits will finish. thentop100 with get extra battles to stabilize
 struct: ok forget math
 struct: Im just going to brute force it
 cegprakash: math can't be forgotten
 struct: Maybe you are right
 struct: I just dont know it
 jacek: still have ptsd from math eh?
 eulerscheZahl: the p stands for pi?
 struct: jacek I will have a new ptsd soon
 struct: I have no idea if thats a math joke euler
 Fubuchi: Is legend recomputed when the game end?
 struct: first 100
 struct: but its not a brand new submit
 struct: you keep your current points
